    "> 📚 **TERM: Streamlit**  \n",
    "> A Python library that turns plain Python scripts into interactive web apps. You write Python — no HTML, CSS, or JavaScript — and Streamlit renders it as a web page with inputs, buttons, and formatted output. It's the fastest way to go from \"I have a function\" to \"I have a web app.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task: **create a Streamlit app that lets a user type a question about Fordham and get an answer from your RAG system.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started:\n",
    "- Install it: `uv pip install streamlit` \n",
    "- A Streamlit app is just a `.py` file (not a notebook). Create something like `fordham_rag_app.py`\n",
    "- Run it: `streamlit run scripts/fordham_rag_app.py` — this opens a browser tab with your app\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips:\n",
    "- Check out the [Streamlit docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/) — the \"Get started\" tutorial is very short\n",
    "- Your best bet is to vibecode your way to this. You'll be surprised how fast you can get it up and running"
