I’m taking RAG + Context Engineering because I want to move beyond just “using AI” and actually learn how to build AI products that work in the real world.

1) I don’t want to be the person who only knows prompts

Anyone can write prompts today. What I care about is building systems that give consistent, accurate outputs, even when users ask messy questions or the data is incomplete.

2) I want to understand how to reduce hallucinations and build trust

If an AI product can’t be trusted, people won’t use it. RAG teaches me how to ground answers in real information instead of letting the model guess.

3) I want to think like an AI PM, not like a casual AI user

This class helps me learn the “product thinking layer” of AI:

what context to retrieve

how to structure it

how to make the output reliable

how to measure quality and improve it over time

That’s exactly the skillset I want to build.

4) I want an edge in interviews

Most candidates will say “AI can automate things.”
I want to confidently say:
I can design AI systems with retrieval, re-ranking, grounding, and evaluation loops so performance improves and errors go down.

5) It matches the kind of roles I’m targeting

If I’m aiming for fintech or enterprise PM roles, I can’t rely on a chatbot that makes things up. Those environments need:

accuracy

privacy

accountability

repeatable performance

RAG + context engineering fits perfectly with that.

6) It directly helps my personal projects too

Whether I’m building something like Clever Closet or an AI tool that explains why a stock is moving, I need the model to work with real data, not vibes. This class helps me build that foundation.

In short: I’m taking this class because I want to learn how to ship AI features that are reliable, grounded, and scalable — not just impressive in demos.
