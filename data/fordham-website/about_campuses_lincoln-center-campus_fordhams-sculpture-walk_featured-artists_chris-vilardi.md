## About Chris Vilardi

[Chris Vilardi, a native New Yorker, received his Bachelor of Fine Arts from Parsons School of Design in New York City. He has exhibited his paintings and sculptures in numerous galleries and private collections in the United States, Europe, and Australia. ]

Vilardi’s work has been showcased in solo and group shows across the country and around the world. He is a member of the National Sculpture Society, LICArtists, American Society of Portrait Artists, Allied Artists of America and Alliance of Queens Artists.
