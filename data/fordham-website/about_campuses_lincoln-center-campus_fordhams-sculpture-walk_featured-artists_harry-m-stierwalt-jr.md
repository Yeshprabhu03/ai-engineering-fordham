## About Harry M. Stierwalt Jr.

[Harry M. Stierwalt Jr., from West Palm Beach, Florida, sculpted the ram statues that appear on both the Rose Hill and Lincoln Center campuses of Fordham. At the installation of the Lincoln Center ram in 2017, Stierwalt told the ]*Fordham Observer* that it had taken him almost a year to construct the sculpture. In addition to the rams, Stierwalt has sculpted frogs, unicorns, and a red colobus monkey that he keeps on his desk.
