## About Jim Rennert

[Jim Rennert was born in 1958, and grew up in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Salt Lake City, Utah. After 10 trying years of working in business, Rennert was inspired to explore his artistic vision and embarked upon his career as a sculptor in 1990. He began exhibiting in galleries in 1993 and has since gained significant recognition. ]

Rennert’s seminal series of works is immediately identifiable, with simplified figures and forms depicting men in suits. Combining the traditional medium of bronze with modern forms of flat laser cut steel, he illustrates concepts of corporate success and the obstacles faced by the modern working man. Drawing on both his past professional experiences, and those of his contemporaries, Rennert composes thought-provoking works to which viewers undeniably react and relate. Early works emphasize movement and physical metaphor, while more recent pieces show the development of a more contemplative character. In 2016, Rennert also released his first series of two-dimensional works, a collection of digital drawings available as large-scale prints.

Rennert continually exhibits at the major U.S. art fairs as well as galleries in New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Florida, Utah, New Mexico, Maine, Colorado, and British Columbia, with private and corporate collectors worldwide. From June 2014 through May 2015, Rennert was honored with a monumental public installation of his iconic sculpture, *THINK BIG*, which was on exhibition in New York City’s Union Square, in cooperation with the NYC Parks Department.
