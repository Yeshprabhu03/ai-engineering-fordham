## About Masami Kodama

[Masami Kodama was born in Hiroshima, Japan, in 1933 and was educated at Kyoto University of Fine Arts, receiving a master’s degree there in 1958. He was invited to the United States in 1964 and taught at the Brooklyn Museum Art School for many years. Kodama is regarded as a master of hand-carved marble sculpture. His graceful forms include the infinitely one-sided, mathematically sophisticated Möbius Strip. Kodama's work has been exhibited in numerous solo and group exhibitions around the world and is in many prestigious public, corporate, and private collections, including that of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.]
