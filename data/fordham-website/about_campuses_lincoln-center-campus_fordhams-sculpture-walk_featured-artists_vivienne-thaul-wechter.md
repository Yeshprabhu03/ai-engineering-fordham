## About Vivienne Thaul Wechter

[Vivienne Thaul Wechter, born in 1910, was an abstract painter, sculptor, and poet, as well as a Fordham professor of interdisciplinary arts and the psychology of creativity. She was widely exhibited in the United States and abroad, and her work is included in collections at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C., the Museum of Fine Art in Houston, the Rose Museum in Brandeis, Massachusetts, the Hudson River Museum, and the United Nations in New York City, among many others. Her poetry and prose was published in books, journals, and exhibit catalogs, and at the time of her death in 2001, she was artist-in-residence at Fordham University.]

“Vivienne Thaul Wechter is an original, intense, expressive lyrical abstract painter possessed of an imagination that sights the unusual,” said Henry Riseman, former director of the New England Center for Contemporary Art, in 2000, when *Hovering Journey*, a one-person exhibition opened in the Kresge Gallery at Ramapo College.
