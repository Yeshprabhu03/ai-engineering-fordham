Our [Lincoln Center campus](/about/campuses/lincoln-center-campus/) is located in the heart of Manhattan, from West 60th to West 62nd Street and between Columbus and Amsterdam avenues. We’re part of the Lincoln Square neighborhood—one block from Central Park and the Time Warner Center, across the street from Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, close to Broadway’s theater district, and within walking distance of the world broadcast headquarters for ABC, CBS, and NBC.
