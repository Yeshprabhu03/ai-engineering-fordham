[Office of Disability Services](/student-life/disability-services/)

The [Office of Disability Services](/student-life/disability-services/) at Fordham University helps to ensure equal educational access and opportunity for all members of our community. In the Jesuit tradition of cura personalis, members of the ODS staff work individually with each student to understand his or her strengths and limitations in order to develop their most effective and comprehensive accommodation plan.

[Counseling and Psychological Services](/student-life/safety-health-and-wellness/counseling-and-psychological-services/)

Fordham’s [Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS)](/student-life/safety-health-and-wellness/counseling-and-psychological-services/) is a comprehensive mental health center that is dedicated to promoting the emotional and psychological health and wellness of our students. At CPS, we recognize that University life can be stressful due to academic, financial, family, and social pressures. These stressors can sometimes contribute to or exacerbate more significant psychological problems, such as depression, anxiety, substance abuse, trauma, or difficulties with sleeping, eating, or attention.
