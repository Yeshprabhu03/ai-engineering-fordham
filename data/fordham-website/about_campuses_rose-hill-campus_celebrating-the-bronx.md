Our [Rose Hill campus](/about/campuses/rose-hill-campus/) is located in the heart of a vibrant Bronx community that has been at the center of artistic, musical, and historic movements. The borough is the birthplace of hip-hop and home to Yankee Stadium, homemade pasta on Arthur Avenue (the original Little Italy), the Bronx Museum of the Arts, the historic Edgar Allan Poe Cottage, world-class medical organizations, two of New York City’s most iconic outdoor cultural spaces—the New York Botanical Garden and the Bronx Zoo, and a diverse community that helps drive innovation.
