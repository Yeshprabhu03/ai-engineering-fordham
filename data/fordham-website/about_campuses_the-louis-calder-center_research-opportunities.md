# Research Opportunities for Undergraduates at the Calder Center

## Calder Summer Undergraduate Research (CSUR) Program

### A Program Overview

Our CSUR program is designed to provide undergraduates with an opportunity to conduct an independent research project within one of the Calder Center's research labs. Under the guidance of a strong mentorship community of faculty and graduate students, the student will conduct research that connects with the larger research goal of the lab.

Undergraduates receive a $5,000 stipend and free on-site housing. This program typically runs for 10 weeks, early-June through mid-August.

### Not Your Typical Summer Internship

Work closely with ecologists at the Calder Center, Fordham’s biological field station near the village of Armonk, NY, in a hilly, wooded region of northern Westchester County. The 113-acre site includes forests, streams, and a 10-acre lake. Learn more about the [Louis Calder Center](/about/campuses/the-louis-calder-center/).

### Gain Direct Experience in Research

In the 10-week intensive program, you will gain experience in all aspects of a research project.

- Literature review
- Experimental design & proposal writing
- Collecting and analyzing data
- Presenting results

In addition, you will attend short courses on conducting ecological field studies and data analysis.
