# Indices at Calder Center

The
[Fordham Pollen Index](/about/campuses/the-louis-calder-center/research/indices/fordham-pollen-index/) is measured by collecting pollen from the air at our Lincoln Center campus in Midtown Manhattan and from our Louis Calder Biological Field Station in Armonk, NY.

The
[Fordham Tick Index](/about/campuses/the-louis-calder-center/research/indices/fordham-tri-state-tick-risk/) is an estimate of the risk of being bitten by a nymphal or adult deer tick. Both of these stages are active at this time of year, although the smaller nymph is responsible for many more cases of Lyme disease. This index measures risk relative to other times of year.
