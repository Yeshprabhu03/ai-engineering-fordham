# Campus Ministry at Fordham Westchester

Campus Ministry at Fordham Westchester seeks to foster the integral growth of all the Fordham University community, thereby complementing the work of other departments and divisions in pursuit of Fordham's overall mission. Campus Ministry assists the University in forming the whole person; i.e., one who is well-informed yet capable of critical reflection; who is deeply aware of personal values and seeks to serve others, particularly those in need; and who strives to form a personal relationship with God.

Campus Ministry offers a warm and trusting welcome to all, a "home away from home" where students, faculty, and staff can always find a listening ear and understanding heart. Besides fulfilling particular responsibilities of maintaining and administering our Chapel/worship space, the Campus Ministry office will provide pastoral counseling and spiritual direction upon request, worship in the community, teach, organize, offer support groups, respond to emergencies, and serve on University committees and as an academic adviser. In so doing, it is hoped to heighten the community's awareness of God at work in our midst, and to dispose that same community to allow God's Spirit to enliven us and bring to fruition our shared goals.

The office of Campus Ministry in Westchester will engage students and the broader Fordham community in education through service for a just and equitable world. The office of Campus Ministry is committed to collaboration with community partners and to involvement with people who are marginalized, especially those who are materially poor. Our work is inspired by, and flows from, the Jesuit Catholic educational mission at Fordham University that calls for a dynamic integration of academic excellence, social responsibility, and faith that serves justice.
