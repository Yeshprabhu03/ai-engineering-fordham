# Westchester Campus Student Services

The Department of Student Services (RH, LC, and Westchester) offers a variety of resources and programs to support students in their achievement, educational goals, personal growth, and professional development. These services advance overall student development and become an integral component of the educational process, with the ultimate goal of strengthening learning outcomes. Consistent with our Jesuit tradition and overall Student Affairs divisional mission, staff offering these services are committed to responding to the full spectrum of diverse student needs and abilities.

Students are encouraged to take advantage of these services and are actively engaged with administrators in the planning process, from the development of new programs discussed in small and informal groups, to formerly administered assessment instruments. Students who have questions or problems with these services should feel free to contact the respective directors or the dean of Student Services.

All undergraduate and graduate students at the Westchester campus can access services, resources, and office hours by visiting department websites. On-site meetings with staff can be scheduled at the Rose Hill or Lincoln Center campuses by telephone.

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and in accordance with Fordham Forward’s reopening guidelines, CPS will continue to adopt, promote and practice a public health informed approach for the delivery and provision of its clinical services. This approach will be guided by the importance of protecting the health and safety of our community while simultaneously supporting and responding to the mental and emotional health needs of our students. Towards this end, CPS will offer a combination of remote, tele-health, and in-person services during the Fall 2020 academic semester. Please note, however, that in-person services will primarily be reserved for students with extenuating clinical or personal circumstances that are contraindicated for remote care. For these students, CPS will provide in-person services in compliance with the following Fordham Forward guidelines for mitigating the transmission of COVID-19:
