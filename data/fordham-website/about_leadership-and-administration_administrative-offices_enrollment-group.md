# Enrollment Group

The Enrollment Group at Fordham includes undergraduate admission, management of financial aid, registration, student employment, tuition billing, and enrollment research. The Enrollment Group is a large unit of the university comprised of nearly 270 employees in several departments.

## Delegate Portal

Fordham University makes provisions for **students to allow third parties to view specific information on the Fordham portal** through a process called "delegate access." Students must use this process to allow third parties (including parents, guardians, family members, and sponsors) to communicate with Enrollment Group staff about the student's education record. This access can be granted or revoked at any time.
