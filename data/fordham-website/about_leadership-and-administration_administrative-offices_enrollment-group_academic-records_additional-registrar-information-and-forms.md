# Additional Registrar Information and Forms

-
In order to change your name, you must submit the below document to the Office of Academic Records. Along with the Name Change request, for security identification protection, you MUST provide two legal original documents as proof that your name has changed. If documents are copies, you must have them notarized prior to sending to Academic Records. Legal documents include, but are not limited to, court orders, birth certificate, social security card, passport, marriage certificate, divorce document, etc.

In order to protect individuals from identity theft, original documents must be provided. Alternatively, if an individual requesting a Name Change cannot present the original documents in person, Academic Records will accept notarized copies of original legal documents. You may mail the Change of Name request and notarized documents to Fordham University's Enrollment Services Office at any campus, or ask to speak with an Enrollment Services representative in person.

If you are a Fordham Employee, you must submit your request and documents to Human Resources. For more information, see Human Resources.
