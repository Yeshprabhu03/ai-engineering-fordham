# Degree Works

Degree Works is a web-based tool to help students and advisors monitor progress towards degree completion. It is provided for advisement purposes only. It is NOT an official record.

Degree Works can be accessed via [Fordham.edu](https://www.fordham.edu/) (on the Students page, under "Current Top Tasks," and on the Advisor page, under "Advisor Quick Access").

With the Degree Works Responsive Dashboard, students, advisors, and deans have access to visual "Degree progress" indicators for Requirements and Credits.

If the "Requirements" indicator shows 99% complete, that means all of the student's requirements have been completed, **except** for the required number of credits for graduation and/or the required number of courses for graduation (this is most common for undergraduates).

If the "Requirements" indicator shows 98% complete, that means the student will have completed their program requirements once all in-progress coursework applying to the audit has been successfully completed (passed).
