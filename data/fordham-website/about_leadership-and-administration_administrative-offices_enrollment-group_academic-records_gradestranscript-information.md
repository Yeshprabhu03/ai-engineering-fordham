# Grades/Transcript Information

## Grade Status

If a grade appears blank on the [fordham.edu](http://fordham.edu/) portal, please check back later. The faculty may not have submitted your grade yet. Grades are due two to three days after the final examination has taken place. Fordham does not mail grade reports; however, students may request a transcript via the National Student Clearinghouse at [https://www.fordham.edu/transcriptrequest](https://www.fordham.edu/transcriptrequest).

Grades are available online within 24 hours after submission. For questions about grades received, please contact the faculty or respective dean's office. Further information regarding specific grades can be found below.

## Determining GPA for Major or Minor

Add the "Quality Points" for all the courses that apply to your major or minor. Then add the "Quality Hours" for those same courses. Divide the sum of the "Quality Points" by the sum of the "Quality Hours". This will give you the GPA for your major or minor.

### Can the University forward transcripts from other institutions and/or test scores? (SATs, APs, etc.)

No. The information that is contained in your file is for University use only. The University does not forward that information to any other institution. If you need a transcript from another institution, or test scores, you have to request that information from the original providing institution.

-
### What is the difference between official and unofficial transcripts?

Electronic PDF transcripts are meant to act as an official transcript when sent directly to the intended recipient. Thus, it is crucial that you have the transcript sent directly to the intended recipient, whether an individual, organization, institution, etc. Electronic transcripts forwarded from one party to another are not deemed official.

For paper transcripts, the envelope must remain unopened for the document to be deemed official. Opening the envelope will invalidate the official transcript. Official transcripts are only for the use of the recipient that they are sent to. Paper transcripts that are opened and forwarded from one party to another are not deemed official.

An unofficial transcript is used for informational purposes only.

In Spring 2020, in response to the learning disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the following colleges/schools of Fordham University adopted an optional pass/fail grading system, allowing students to declare any (or all) of their standard letter grade courses pass/fail (provided the course had not already been graded). Except where noted below, this policy applied both to students enrolled in each college/school, and to courses offered by that college/school (study abroad


courses included).- Fordham College at Rose Hill
- Fordham College at Lincoln Center
- Gabelli School of Business (Undergraduate)
- School of Professional and Continuing Studies (Undergraduate)
- Graduate School of Arts & Sciences
- This school also uses the grade of "High Pass" (HP), which is awarded at the instructor's discretion.

- Graduate School of Education
- Graduate School of Social Service
- Gabelli School of Business (Graduate)
- Students in this school were only permitted to designate graduate courses in the Gabelli School of Business as pass/fail.


Two schools did not offer an optional pass/fail grading system for its students: (1) Graduate School of Religion and Religious Education; (2) School of Professional and Continuing Studies (Graduate). Students in these schools were not permitted to declare any of their standard letter grade courses as pass/fail, regardless of the college/school in which their course(s) were taken.

Students earning a passing grade on the pass/fail scale receive full credit for the course, with no impact on the grade point average; students earning a failing grade in a pass/fail course receive no credit, with no impact on the grade point average.

The minimum passing grade equivalent for each college/school can be found on

[Fordham University's Explanation of Transcripts](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/academic-records/pdfs/Fordham-Explanation-of-Transcript.pdf).Not all colleges/schools have the same minimum passing grade equivalent.

Courses taken pass/fail pursuant to the above policy were accepted in fulfillment of all major, minor, concentration, undergraduate Core Curriculum, and graduate program requirements. They were also accepted as fulfilling the pre-requisites for higher-level courses, where applicable. Ordinarily, courses taken pass/fail could not be used for such purposes.


The deadline for making the pass/fail election was**Friday, 4/24/2020 at 11:59 pm**.Once elected, the pass/fail choice was irrevocable. As indicated earlier, students could not declare any course that had already been graded as pass/fail.
