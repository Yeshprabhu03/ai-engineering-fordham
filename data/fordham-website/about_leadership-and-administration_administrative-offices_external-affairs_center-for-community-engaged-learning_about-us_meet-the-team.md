Keisha Shay has more than 15 years of experience in education, community engagement, and higher education administration, with prior roles at New York University and Montclair State University.

Through this approach, she supports experiential learning opportunities, faculty-led collaborations, and programs that expand student access to mentorship, career exposure, and public-facing scholarship while contributing meaningful capacity to Bronx-based organizations and communities.

Dr. Shay is committed to building sustainable partnerships that honor community expertise, align academic work with community priorities, and expand access to high-impact learning experiences.

**Maria Rodriguez-Gomez - Associate Director, Engaged Student Learning**McShane Campus Center, Suite 215

[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#81ecf3eee5f3e8e6f4e4fbb3b2b8c1e7eef3e5e9e0ecafe4e5f4)

Maria received her bachelor’s degree in Public Administration from John Jay College of Criminal Justice, where she also completed a minor in Sociology. A proud Bronx native, Maria's educational journey was shaped by a strong commitment to public service and a deep interest in understanding the social structures that impact communities like her own.

While pursuing her degree, Maria worked for ten years at a notable immigration law firm in New York City. This experience offered her extensive exposure to the fast-paced and emotionally charged world of immigration services. She developed a strong foundation in customer service, learning how to communicate effectively with individuals from diverse backgrounds and to provide support during often difficult and uncertain times.

More than just a job, this role became a formative part of Maria's personal and professional development. It was during these years that she discovered a profound sense of purpose—advocating for individuals and families who are often overlooked, underserved, or marginalized. The stories she encountered and the resilience she witnessed solidified her passion for equity, justice, and human dignity.

Maria is also deeply passionate about education and access. She believes in the transformative power of learning and is committed to helping create pathways for others—especially those from underserved communities—to pursue their educational goals and unlock their full potential.

Kujegi is passionate about creating meaningful connections across different platforms, entities, and people. In her current role as Assistant Director of Community Engagement and Operations at Fordham's Center for Community Engaged Learning, she looks forward to facilitating empowering connections between Fordham students and the surrounding neighborhoods. Kujegi brings with her to Fordham a background in non-profit program management, community organizing and advocacy for faith-based and immigrant communities, and partnership cultivation. In her personal time, she gives back to her Gambian community by mentoring young West-African Muslim women and helping to empower them on their journey to college as part of her work with the Smiling Coast Women Empowerment Network. Kujegi holds a bachelor’s degree in Anthropology from Princeton University and graduated cum laude in 2016. In 2019, she received the Leadership Award from the Senegambia Awards Gala for her trailblazing work in supporting young women from the Senegambia Diaspora. That same year, she also received a Commendation from the Office of the Comptroller for her outstanding community work building bridges and empowering immigrant young women. Kujegi gets the most excitement from when she is supporting others and working to improve the processes and systems they are in, when she is sharing her poetry with others, and when she is baking banana bread for her family and friends.
