# FAQ/Procedures

** Who can submit an application for BRICS?**

The Community-Based Organizations (CBO) will lead the process by identifying their needs and guiding the development of the proposal, with input from the faculty member. Additionally, any Fordham faculty member, including part-time and non-tenure track faculty, is eligible to participate in this opportunity.

** Does the research need to focus on the Bronx?**

Yes, BRICS projects need to be focused on the needs and opportunities in the Bronx.

** Can a Fordham faculty member submit a proposal?**

At BRICS, we believe in a community-driven approach where the CBO leads the project process. To initiate collaboration, the CBO must first submit a completed questionnaire. After consultation with the BRICS team and the faculty matching process, the CBO and faculty will work together to draft the full proposal, which will be submitted by the CBO.

**How can I get started?**

Please sign up for an Office Hour or contact [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) for an initial consultation session. We will help you get started with the process.

** How much funding is available? **

Available funding is up to $50,000 per project, which can be spread across one or two years.

** Can co-PIs from other universities be included?**

Yes, co-PIs from other universities can be included, and they can be compensated through the project budget. However, primary funding should prioritize the CBO partner and Fordham faculty. Co-PIs from other institutions should only be included after ensuring that sufficient resources are allocated to the core Fordham-CBO partnership.

**Can I include my salary in the budget?**

Yes, Fordham faculty can include their salary in the project budget. Course releases and summer stipends are allowable but must align with Fordham's guidelines on institutional base salary. **Please note that only one course release is applicable per project, and it must be scheduled during the semester in which the majority of the work is completed. **These allocations are also contingent upon approval from the Provost's Office.
