# Framework

## Framework

At BRICS, we focus on creating strong partnerships between community based organizations and university scholars, ensuring that our research directly benefits the community.

We do this through a collaborative approach known as Community-Based Participatory Action Research (CBPAR). To enhance this collaboration, we also use a method called Appreciative Inquiry (AI, Cooperrider & Srivastva, 1987).

**What is Appreciative Inquiry?**

Appreciative Inquiry is a positive approach to working together that focuses on what’s already working well. Instead of starting with problems, AI starts by identifying the strengths and successes of a community. The idea is that by building on what’s already good, we can create even better outcomes. AI involves five simple steps:

**Define: **We start by deciding what we want to focus on. What is important to the community?

**Discover:** We look for what’s already working well in the community. What are the strengths and successes we can build on?

**Dream: **We imagine what the future could look like if we build on these strengths. What is the community’s vision for the future?

**Design: **We work together to create a plan to turn these dreams into reality. How can we make this vision happen?

**Deliver:** We implement the plan and ensure it continues to grow and benefit the community over time. How will we ensure our changes last and continue to help the community?

**How we use Appreciative Inquiry**

By incorporating Appreciative Inquiry into our work at BRICS, we make sure that our research is not only collaborative and respectful but also focused on creating positive, long-lasting change in the community. Specifically, we focus on the following principles of CBPAR through the lens of AI:

**Partnerships:** We partner with community members in every stage of the research process. Using appreciative inquiry, we focus on what the community values and what’s already working well.

**Learning Together:** Both researchers and community members learn from each other. We recognize and build on the strengths of everyone involved.

**Taking Action: **Our research isn’t just about studying problems; it’s about creating solutions that work.

**Cultural Relevance:** We design our research to ensure that our work is relevant and respectful of the community’s identity and values.

**Long-Term Impact:** We aim to create lasting benefits for the community. Appreciative Inquiry helps us make sure that the positive changes we create together are sustainable and continue to grow.
