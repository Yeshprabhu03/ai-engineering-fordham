Murad Awawdeh, PCS '19, a native of Brooklyn, had only just taken on the executive director role at the New York Immigration Coalition, as the organization was pulled into a crisis orchestrated by Texas governor Greg Abbott, who had begun busing immigrants from the border to cities such Washington D.C. and New York. Over 15,000 people have arrived in New York since May, straining the city’s shelter system.

Awawdeh spoke about that crisis as part of “Coalition Building in New York Communities: A Conversation with the New York Immigration Coalition,” a conversation hosted by Kujegi Camara, assistant director for community engagement and operations at Fordham’s [Center for Community Engaged Learning.](https://www.fordham.edu/about/living-the-mission/center-for-community-engaged-learning/)
