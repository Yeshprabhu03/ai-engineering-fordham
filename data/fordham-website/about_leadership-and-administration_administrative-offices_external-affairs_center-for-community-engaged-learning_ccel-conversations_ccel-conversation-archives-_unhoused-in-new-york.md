The Fortune Society highlighted the event in their newsletter in December 2002.

*Here are remarks from Fordham student Jessica Clouser, included in the newsletter:*

"Hello, my name is Jessica Clouser. Over the course of this semester, I have been doing

engaged learning work at the Fortune Society. As a volunteer, I performed data entry for

Fortune Society's housing department, which assists individuals with justice involvement,

and their families experiencing homelessness, through supportive and affordable housing.

Specifically, I entered service plan reviews for clients living at Fortune's new supportive

housing site in the Morrisania neighborhood of the Bronx.

engaged learning work at the Fortune Society. As a volunteer, I performed data entry for

Fortune Society's housing department, which assists individuals with justice involvement,

and their families experiencing homelessness, through supportive and affordable housing.

Specifically, I entered service plan reviews for clients living at Fortune's new supportive

housing site in the Morrisania neighborhood of the Bronx.

While entering these service plan reviews, I was able to read about developments happening

in various clients' lives. This led me to reflect on the idea of "progress" and how healing,

especially after reentry from incarceration, is not a linear process. Some clients seemed like

they were on track to be "success stories," and others were faltering in reaching their goals,

but their case managers remained nonjudgmental, supportive, and encouraging regardless

of where they were in their recovery journey. Fortune is genuinely invested in not only

maintaining the safety of clients, but also in fostering community. I noticed that many case

managers encourage their clients to join activities and events that take place in the building

in order to build interpersonal and social connections, essential components in maintaining

or improving one's mental well-being.

Something that I especially admire about The Fortune Society is that the staff members treat

their clients with respect; as people with individual desires, and needs, rather than as

problems to be fixed or disappeared. I feel so fortunate to have been able to work with an

organization like Fortune Society that is so genuinely supportive of its clients and is helping

to alleviate the harms of the incarceration system."
