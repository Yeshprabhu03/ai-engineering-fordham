Fordham's Center for Community Engaged Learning sponsors courses according to an asset-based approach to engagement. We bring the institutional and academic resources of the University together with the leadership, experience, and richness of our communities to enhance student learning, support faculty research, and build on community strengths. Students mobilize abstract concepts they learn in the classroom by engaging in real-world challenges. They enhance memory and retention by teaching new ideas to young people in local schools and centering on reflective practices together with their classes. They immerse themselves in the various cultures of New York’s vibrant neighborhoods and speak the myriad languages native to our city, and they hone civic leadership skills and take on pressing matters of policy and equity by partnering with elected officials, community boards, activists, and organizations to work for change.
