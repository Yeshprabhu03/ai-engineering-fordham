Each community engaged learning course proposal must include the following elements:

- A short course description
- A set of course learning objectives
- An identified partnership model (partner need not be identified; prospective partners or type of partner may be included)
- Proposed writing assignments and reflective practice

Additional elements, which are not required but which may be added, are:

- Course readings
- Assessment practices
- Proposed course theme and timeline
- Course outcomes

The Center for Community Engaged Learning offers one-on-one appointments to support the creation of new courses!

**If you would like to see an example of a course proposal, please email [email protected].**
