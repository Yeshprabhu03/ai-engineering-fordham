# Office of Community Affairs

Fordham's **Office of Community Affairs** builds connections between Fordham University's campuses and students, faculty, staff and alumni with external community organizations, institutions, and community members. Through volunteering, convening conversations, creating diverse programming on and off campus and participating in local civic life, Fordham is a relevant neighbor in our campus homes in New York City, Westchester and beyond.
