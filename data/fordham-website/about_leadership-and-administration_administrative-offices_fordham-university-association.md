# Fordham University Association

## Welcome to the FUA!

The Fordham University Association (FUA) was founded 60 years ago to foster a strong sense of community among all employees through engaging social events.

As a Fordham employee, you are automatically granted membership in the FUA. There is no membership fee. The FUA consists of an executive committee and operates under the generous sponsorship of our president, Tania Tetlow. Thanks to her support, the executive committee is equipped with the necessary resources to plan events throughout the academic year.

The FUA has launched a Summer Book Club, and the [Knit, Chat, and Crochet with the FUA](/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/fordham-university-association/event-calendar/event-photos/knit-chat-and-crochet-with-the-fua/). Plus, our beloved in-person traditions for the entire family - the Children's Christmas Party, Mardi Gras Luncheon, and Easter Egg Hunt are back.

With events on all campuses, your presence and participation make the FUA truly vibrant. Come join us and be part of the Fordham community spirit!
