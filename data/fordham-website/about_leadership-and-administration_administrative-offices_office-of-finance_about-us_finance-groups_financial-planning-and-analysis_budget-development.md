# Budget Development

BPREP is the name of the computer software that will be used by organization managers to prepare and submit:

- Budget proposals for the next fiscal year.
- Projections for the subsequent four fiscal years.

BPREP will replace the existing application and forms that have previously been used for this purpose. Was designed to take advantage of modern desktop computing capabilities and to allow organization managers more flexibility and options for preparing their budget requests.

The development of BPREP resulted from a series of recommendations made in June 1998 by the Financial Management Design Team as part of the Pathways to Excellence project.
