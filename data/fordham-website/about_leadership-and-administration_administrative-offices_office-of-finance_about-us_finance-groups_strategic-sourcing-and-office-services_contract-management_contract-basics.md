**Departments own their Contracts**.

**What this means:**

- Fordham generally allows individual schools, departments, and units to make their own purchasing decisions for goods and services, provided University policies and procedures are followed.
- University employees involved in these purchases are responsible for understanding Fordham's policies and procedures for contracting, including purchasing, payment, and supplier relations.
- Departments are expected to know and understand their contracts.
- Contracts cannot be signed without going through the review process.

[A Contract Manager’s Responsibility in this ownership includes:]

- Knowing and following FINBUY and FINCON policies and procedures.
- Reading and understanding contracts.
- Leading and setting the tone of negotiations with suppliers.
- Identifying and routing issues and questions through the FINCON portal (stakeholder/subject matter expert).

Contracts are required for

**Services**, which are defined as works or duties provided to the University by business organizations or individuals, and may be standalone, repetitive, or ongoing.

**Contracts that Need FINCON Review**

Certain contracts are required to go through the FINCON review process:

- IT service contracts where suppliers will have access to Fordham’s sensitive IT systems or sensitive/confidential information (e.g., cloud services that host personally identifiable information).
- "Mission-critical" software licenses.
- Contracts for the purchase or lease of real property.
- Consulting, Professional Services Agreements.
- Purchase finance transactions (e.g., capital leases or lease-to-own contracts).
- Restrictive contract clauses that prevent Fordham from interacting or doing business with certain individuals/entities, or undertaking otherwise lawful actions (e.g., non-compete or exclusivity clauses).

**Contract Management Process Overview**

**Pre-FINCON Requirements**

Before a contract moves forward in the process, and especially before it reaches the contract review team, you must obtain sufficient approval from your department chair, Dean's Office, or VP. The **budget line must also be completed** on each contract as a requirement. This upfront approval is crucial because contract review, revision, and negotiation demand significant time, effort, and cost.

The contract management process is a series of steps:

| 1. |
|
The Contract Manager (CM) checks |
| 2. |
|
The CM engages the supplier to obtain all necessary documents, like the Statement of Work (SOW), Terms and Conditions, and MSA. The CM and supplier should agree upon a written Scope of Services and whether to use the Fordham MSA or supplier paper. |
| 3. |
|
The CM initiates contract creation, completes a Question Informational Page, and uploads necessary documents into FINCON. The CM starts and manages the FINCON Review Rounds (Internal and External). The Contract Review Team reviews and edits the contract during the Internal Review Round and may contact the supplier. The CM also works with IT on an IT Questionnaire. |
| 4. |
|
Following the return of the contract with mutually agreed-upon terms, the CM verifies several items, including : * The contract is a |
| 5. |
|
The CM receives a notification through Jaggaer, accesses FINCON, and initiates the eSignature process, which redirects them to
|

Ongoing monitoring and review of all contracts are essential responsibilities of the Contract Manager.
