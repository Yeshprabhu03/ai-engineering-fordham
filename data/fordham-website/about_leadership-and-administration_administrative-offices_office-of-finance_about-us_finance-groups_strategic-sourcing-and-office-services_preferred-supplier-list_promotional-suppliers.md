# Promotional Suppliers

**Prioritizing University-Wide Contracted Suppliers**

We established fourteen Contracted Suppliers for branded apparel and promotional items. Suppliers were consolidated so that these services can be purchased through a limited number of University-wide Contracted Suppliers. Additional suppliers will be added as needed.

We strongly encourage the use of University-wide Contracted Suppliers whenever possible due to the significant advantages they offer.

Orders over $5000 require a Purchase Order issued from[ Strategic Sourcing via FINBUY.](/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/office-of-finance/about-us/finance-groups/strategic-sourcing-and-office-services/procurement-operations/)

Fordham’s official brand guidelines can be found on [Fordham’s Brand Standards website](https://live.standards.site/fordham-university/). For any questions about Fordham's standards, please contact: [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

**Please consider using these suppliers for these items, as they have been vetted by University Marketing**

*Kitting involves the assembly, packaging, and often the direct fulfillment of multiple promotional products and related materials into a single, cohesive, branded "kit" or package
