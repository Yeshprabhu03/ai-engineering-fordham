# About the Travel and Expense Program

The University’s Treasury and Risk group within the Office of Finance oversees Fordham’s Travel and Expense program. The program is designed to provide for comprehensive and cost-effective travel services and efficient reporting. Two critical and related components of the program are the designated travel agency and the online systems for booking travel and reporting business expenses. The two components are closely integrated, which significantly increases the efficiency of the program.

Fordham has designated [Corporate Travel Planners (CTP)](https://ctp-travel.com/) as its preferred travel service provider. CTP provides both agent direct and online reservation services. The online service is provided through Concur Travel. The system for reporting travel and business expenses is also a Concur product.
