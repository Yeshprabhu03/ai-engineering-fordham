# Booking Travel

University travelers should book all travel arrangements, including transportation, lodging, and car rental, through Corporate Travel Planners (CTP), Fordham’s designated travel service agency. Corporate Travel Planners has configured Fordham’s travel policy in their call-in and online systems. Travelers will be notified if the booking is out of compliance with the University travel policy.

Booking Travel with CTP can be done by calling an agent directly or by using [FINTREX](https://loginp.fordham.edu/idp/profile/SAML2/Unsolicited/SSO?providerId=https://www.concursolutions.com), powered by Concur's Online Booking tool. FINTREX provides access to the same transportation and hotel marketplace as other online services and in some cases with better rates by using the CTP-sponsored discounts. The traveler can also contact CTP to address issues with their online reservations or while traveling.

### Concur Mobile App

Book travel via smartphone or tablet with the [Concur Mobile App](https://www.concur.com/en-us/mobile). Before booking with the app, please update your travel profile. See completion instructions in the "Booking Travel Online" section, below.
