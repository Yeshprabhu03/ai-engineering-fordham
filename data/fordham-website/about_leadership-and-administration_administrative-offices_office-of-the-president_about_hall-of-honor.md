# Hall of Honor

The Hall of Honor recognizes members of the Fordham community whose lives have exemplified and brought recognition to the ideals to which the University is devoted.

The honorees include artists, writers, business leaders, philanthropists, Medal of Honor recipients, titans of professional sports, religious leaders, a Nobel Prize- winning physicist, and public servants who broke barriers of race and gender.

While most honorees are Fordham alumni, some of them first came to the University as distinguished faculty members. Others played a pivotal role in Fordham history: the Hall of Honor’s inaugural Class of 2008, for example, includes Archbishop John Hughes, who founded Fordham and went on to become the first archbishop of New York.

In their life stories, the honorees convey both the sweep of Fordham history and the wide sphere of accomplishment and service for which the University has prepared students since its founding in 1841.
