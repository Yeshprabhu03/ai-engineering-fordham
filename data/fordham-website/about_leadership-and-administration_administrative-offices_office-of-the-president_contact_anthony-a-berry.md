Anthony A. Berry joined Fordham in July 2024 as the FitzSimons Fellow in the Office of the President. In this role, he helps coordinate events, programs, and other opportunities across Fordham's various campuses, engaging the community in how to approach difficult topics with civility and how to engage the different levers of democracy. This includes working across colleges and departments to bring in speakers, plan engaging content for students and faculty, and coordinating other special projects for the Office of the President.

Prior to his current role at Fordham, Tony was most recently a civics sector management consultant at the New York-based firm, Bennett Midland. In his role there as a Senior Associate, he worked primarily with local governments, philanthropies, and non-profits on a variety of projects. This included working with clients such as Bloomberg Philanthropies on the Greenwood Initiative and the Mayors Migration Council on their strategic planning needs.

Tony has also served as a Congressional Black Caucus Foundation intern for the late Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee during his time as an undergraduate and he has been a Global Strategy Specialist for Kobre & Kim, an international law firm based in Manhattan. During his tenure at Kobre & Kim, he helped lead their referral and relationship program and co-founded the firm’s racial and ethnic affinity group for employees, Diversity@K&K. In his role as co-founder, he was able to help the firm partner with women and minority-owned businesses for various events in the firm’s offices around the country.

Outside of Fordham, Tony is an active volunteer for Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York where he serves on the Executive Committee for its Junior Board.

He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from The University of Alabama in 2018, majoring in economics with minors in history and global studies.
