# Elizabeth Rainey, Ed.D.

Elizabeth (Liz) Rainey joined the Fordham community in 2025 as the inaugural Vice Provost for Student Success. This role leads the university-wide strategy for retention, from developing a distinctive first-year experience with wrap-around support to readying students to pursue fulfilling careers. Under her leadership, Fordham brings together several areas that directly impact student retention, including academic records, the career center, international services, and the first-year experience.

Liz has held administrative positions at New York University, Columbia University, and Loyola University New Orleans where she previously served as Assistant Provost for Student Success. A native New Yorker, Liz holds a B.A. from Georgetown University, an M.A. from New York University, an Ed.M. from Teachers College, Columbia University, and an Ed.D. from the University of Texas at Austin where her research focused on students’ experiences, retention outcomes, and financial aid policy.
