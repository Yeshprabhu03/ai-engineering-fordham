# Speech Act Series

## Mission

Fierce debates have erupted across the political spectrum over issues of free speech and social media, truth claims and fake news, justifiable norms and mob action, and they often fuel more outrage than reasoned discourse. University campuses are a particular focus of the controversies over “cancel culture” and “deplatforming” and “calling out.” But a college campus should be the locus of conversations that can enlighten and educate.

Fordham University hosted a series of panels and speakers during the academic year 2021-22 that sought to highlight these issues and engage audiences in a challenging yet constructive way. The series, entitled “Speech Acts” covered range of topics and issues.
