# Phase Two: Develop a Comprehensive Framework for the University Core

## Phase Two Committee

- The Phase Two committee is charged with representing the faculty as a whole and the interests of all undergraduates, rather than any specific constituencies. Its smaller size reflects the expectation that Phase Two will engage in broad consultation and work directly with departments, areas and programs to formulate a feasible and compelling framework for the Core Curriculum.
- The Phase Two committee members are:
- Christopher Aubin
- Daniel Contreras
- Chris Dietrich
- Ying Hong
- Johanna Francis
- Yuliya Komarova
- Jim McCartin
- Sharif Mowlabocus
- Dongli Zhang


## Duration

It is hoped that the work of Phase Two, including all relevant approvals, will be completed in the academic year ending in 2024.
