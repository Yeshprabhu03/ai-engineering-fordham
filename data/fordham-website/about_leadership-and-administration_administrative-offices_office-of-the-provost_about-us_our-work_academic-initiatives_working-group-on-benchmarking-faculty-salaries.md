# Working Group on Benchmarking Faculty Salaries

The working group is charged with reviewing the results of a faculty salary benchmarking study designed to compare the base salaries of Fordham’s tenure-stream faculty to similarly situated faculty at a group of comparable institutions. The study aims to help Fordham recruit and retain stellar faculty by ensuring that the base salaries of our tenure-stream faculty are appropriately positioned relative to the external market in which we compete for talent. In addition to examining the distribution of faculty salaries at a snapshot in time, the working group will also recommend ways in which Fordham can annually allocate faculty salaries to remain competitive with comparable institutions.
