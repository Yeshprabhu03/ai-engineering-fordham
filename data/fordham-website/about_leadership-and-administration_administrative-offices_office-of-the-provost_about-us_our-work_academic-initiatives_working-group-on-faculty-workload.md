# Working Group on Faculty Workload

The working group is charged with examining the policies and practices that affect the collective workload (teaching, scholarship, and service) of Fordham’s tenure-stream faculty. The group will analyze current workload data at Fordham, review workload policies and practices here and at peer institutions, identify best practices and innovative approaches to workload management, and make recommendations regarding workload policies and practices that will promote faculty research productivity, sustain (or enhance) the overall quality of instruction, and achieve a more equitable distribution of responsibilities among faculty.
