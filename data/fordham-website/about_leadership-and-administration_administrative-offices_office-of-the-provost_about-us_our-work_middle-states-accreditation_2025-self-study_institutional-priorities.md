# Institutional Priorities

## Institutional Priorities

The selection of institutional priorities that matter to an institution is key to ensuring that the reaccreditation process is informative, insightful, and valuable. Fordham's priorities were forward-looking, inspired by [our strategic plan](/about/strategic-planning/educating-for-justice-fordham-universitys-vision-and-strategic-plan-20212026/), and guided our Self-Study design.

Priority One: Wisdom, Knowledge, and Learning

Position Fordham as a leader in the discovery of wisdom, creation of knowledge, and transmission of learning through distinctive research, teaching, and programs, including those that educate for justice and address the challenges of our time.

Enhance the holistic student experience, both inside and outside the classroom, in order to maximize the ability of all students to both succeed and flourish at Fordham and beyond.
