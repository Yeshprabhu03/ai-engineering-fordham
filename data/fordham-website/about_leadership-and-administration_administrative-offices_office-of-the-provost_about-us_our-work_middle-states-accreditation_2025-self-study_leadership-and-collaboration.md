# Leadership and Collaboration

The Self-Study Steering Committee comprises 19 members, including a faculty Co-Chair and administrative Co-Chair.

Care was taken to design an inclusive Steering Committee with members who represented all facets of the University community. Individuals represent knowledgeable and invested faculty and administrators from multiple schools and units throughout the institution. Steering Committee members will also serve as Co-Chairs or members of the [Working Groups and Teams](/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/office-of-the-provost/about-us/our-work/middle-states-accreditation/2025-self-study/leadership-and-collaboration/working-groups-and-teams/).
