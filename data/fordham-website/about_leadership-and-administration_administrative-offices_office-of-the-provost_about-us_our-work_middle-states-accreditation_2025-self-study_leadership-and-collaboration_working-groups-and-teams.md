# Middle States Self-Study Working Groups and Teams

The Self-Study Working Groups and Teams also represent all facets of the University community. Working Groups are mapped to individual standards and relevant requirements of affiliation while also reflecting the relational nature of all standards achieved through cross-group collaboration. In addition to the seven Working Groups, three Teams supplement the efforts to ensure an inclusive, transparent, and data-driven process.
