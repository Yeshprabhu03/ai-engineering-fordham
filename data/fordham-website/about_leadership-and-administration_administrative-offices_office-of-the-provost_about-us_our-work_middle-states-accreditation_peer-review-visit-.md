# Middle States Accreditation

**The Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) reviews the University's mission and goals, its performance, and its resources every eight years in order to ensure compliance with seven standards of excellence. **

## Reaccredited Through 2033!

Fordham began its process of preparing for reaccreditation in Fall 2022. Over 150 faculty, staff, and students worked on a variety of working groups and teams and countless others participated in meetings and surveys leading to our 2025 Self-Study Report and reaccreditation in Summer 2025.

“A successful Self-Study not only leads to MSCHE reaccreditation. It should serve as an opportunity for the University to engage in a deep examination of our current practices, reflect on opportunities and challenges facing our community, and discern what steps we can take collectively to more fully advance our mission.”

- Dennis Jacobs, Provost
