[Colleges and Schools](https://www.fordham.edu/info/20012/colleges_and_schools)

Our four undergraduate colleges and six graduate schools don’t just teach the nuts and bolts of our fields. We work toward an enlightenment that comes from understanding how our world is connected and your place in it.

[Centers and Institutes](https://www.fordham.edu/info/20061/centers_and_institutes)

Our Centers and Institutes are an important part of the academic setting of the University. We are committed to research and creative learning and advancements inside and outside of the classroom while fostering a collaborative environment for faculty and student engagement.
