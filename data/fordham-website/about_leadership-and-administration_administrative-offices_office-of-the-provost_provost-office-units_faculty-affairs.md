Welcoming our newest faculty members to the Fordham community!

## Welcome to the Office of Faculty Affairs

We provide a wide range of resources to support you through every stage of the academic lifecycle from the time you join the Fordham family, throughout your career, and beyond. Along the way, we’re here to answer your questions, facilitate transitions, and celebrate your accomplishments and share them with your colleagues across the University community.
