In the classroom, Dr. Guardado is an extraordinary teacher (he was last year’s recipient of both the Undergraduate Humanities Teaching Award and a co-recipient of the Pedagogy Innovation Award!) whose courses on Christian mysticism and liberation theology have transformed students’ lives and inspired future scholars.
