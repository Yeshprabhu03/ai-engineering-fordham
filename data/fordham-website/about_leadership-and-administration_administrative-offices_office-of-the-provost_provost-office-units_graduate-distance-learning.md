# Graduate Distance Learning (GDL) Services

GDL offers a variety of services to Fordham’s graduate schools to position Fordham Online as a world-class teaching and learning environment for students and faculty.

GDL instructional designers collaborate with faculty to ensure programs are designed for optimal student engagement, accessibility and equity, and academic success in asynchronous, synchronous, and hybrid modalities.

In addition to offering instructional design assistance, we support faculty with professional development opportunities, access to resources, and additional expertise through University offices like IT, disability services, counseling, career services, and the libraries.
