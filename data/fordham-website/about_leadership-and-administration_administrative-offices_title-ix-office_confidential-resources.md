#### Confidential Resources for Instances of Sexual and Related Misconduct

Community members may want to talk about their experiences involving sexual and related misconduct in a supportive, confidential space that allows them to discuss and process their feelings. If you prefer to report an incident confidentially, there are a number of on-campus and off-campus resources to assist you.

**The University provides Confidential Resources, who are trained administrators and staff members available to those community members who do not wish to report their experience.**

In addition, community members can reach out to Confidential Off-Campus Resources available 24/7, 365 days per year.

Except in limited circumstances, communications with the Confidential Resources listed below will not be shared with the Department of Public Safety, the Gender Equity and Title IX Office, the Title IX Coordinator, the Deans of Students, or any other member of the University community.
