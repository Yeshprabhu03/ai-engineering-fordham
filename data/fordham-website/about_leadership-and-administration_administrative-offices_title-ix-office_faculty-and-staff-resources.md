**Supporting the Success of Pregnant and Parenting Students:**


The University encourages and supports the academic and professional success of pregnant and parenting students and employees. Fordham's non-discrimination policy specifically prohibits discrimination against those of marital or parental status, which includes on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or recovery therefrom.Reasonable accommodations may be needed to assist such students in order for them to continue their enrollment and course of study. However, students must still fulfill the required academic course, program, and or licensing requirements of any course or program.

Because the requirements for courses, programs, and schools at Fordham vary, the deans and faculty are typically in the best position to decide how students can make up missed work.

- Students who are pregnant and anticipate missing coursework due to pregnancy, giving birth, or recovery from childbirth should, if possible, inform their professors early in the course or program so that it may be easier for the professor to explore options to assist the student in completing your coursework. Please note that not all requests for accommodations can be made.
- Faculty are required to offer pregnant and parenting students reasonable accommodation in order to finish their coursework. This may include viable alternatives or additional time to complete required course requirements. It is at the individual faculty member’s discretion to determine what is considered a viable, reasonable accommodation.

Please consider placing the following the statement on your course syllabi:


"As a faculty member, I am a mandatory reporter and am required to contact and provide information to Public Safety, to the Dean of Students, and/or to the Title IX Coordinator if I learn you have been sexually harassed (verbally or physically), sexually assaulted /raped, stalked, had domestic violence or dating violence occur in a relationship, or been a victim / survivor of any behavior prohibited by the University's Sexual Misconduct Policy and Procedures. Once reported, the University will promptly seek to properly support any student and make efforts to stop the discrimination, prevent it from recurring, and remedy its effects. There are three confidential places on campus where you can seek support where it will not be "reported": clinical counselors in Psychological & Counseling Services, pastoral counselors in Campus Ministry, and medical service providers in University Health Services. The Student CARE Brochure can provide you with on and off-campus resources for support and more information, and you can also visit www.fordham.edu/care or www.fordham.edu/sexualmisconduct for more information."Please also see
