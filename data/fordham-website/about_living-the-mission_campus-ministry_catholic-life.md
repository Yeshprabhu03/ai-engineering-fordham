# Catholic Life

## Welcome to Catholic Life

Propelled by student leaders, Catholic Life is a dynamic ministry, reflecting the many facets and faces of our Catholic tradition and community. We encounter God in prayer, in the Word and in the Eucharist, as well as in our sisters and brothers in the events of daily life.

Be part of one of our many clubs or groups, like Bible Study, AMDG Club, or men's and women's spirituality groups. Come as you are to a thought provoking lecture or laughter-inducing game night. Contribute as a liturgical minister or volunteer alongside our community.

For information about participating in Catholic Life at Fordham, explore this section or stop by the Campus Ministry offices in McShane Center 215 (RH), Lowenstein 217 (LC), or Room 133 (W).

Let us learn to live with kindness, to love everyone, even when they do not love us
