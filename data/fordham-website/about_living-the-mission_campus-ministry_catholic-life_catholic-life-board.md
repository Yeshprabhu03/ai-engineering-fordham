#### The Catholic Life Board is a student led organization whose mission is to bring together liturgical ministers, Catholic clubs and organizations, and our larger Catholic Community by expanding the Catholic Faith outside the University Church Walls through programs that nurture spirituality, form fellowship among students, and engage our community in service and justice.
