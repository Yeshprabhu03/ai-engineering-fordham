## Explore Religious Life

Explore Jesuit Vocations and religious life!

Have you ever considered that God may be calling you to serve the Church as a Jesuit priest or brother? Have others commented that, "You would make a great Jesuit"? The Jesuits at Fordham offer a simple program to support you if you are serious about learning more about the Society of Jesus and learning how to listen to God's voice as to discern what the Lord is asking you.


**Faith. Fellowship. Fraternity.**

The Catholic Men’s Group meets every three weeks to grow together in faith, deepen our prayer lives, and explore what it means to be Catholic men in today’s world. It’s a space for real conversation, mutual support, and spiritual friendship.

If you’re looking for a community grounded in faith, fellowship, and fraternity, please join us.

For more information and this semester's schedule, contact Fr. Eric Studt SJ ([[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)) or Luke Olsen SJ ([[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)).

If you’re discerning a vocation to the priesthood or religious life, we’d be honored to accompany you on that journey as well. Please contact us or visit [Jesuit Vocations](https://www.beajesuit.org/).
