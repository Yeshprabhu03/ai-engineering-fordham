# Christian Life Communities

Christian Life Communities (CLC) are small groups that meet weekly to cultivate spirituality in an intentional setting. They are built upon the three pillars of faith, community, and mission, and are a great way to nourish your faith, form lasting friendships, and live out the gospel values!

## Three Pillars of CLC

**Faith**: CLC is a strong foundation of faith, a way of "finding God in all things." Groups focus on Scripture, prayer, song, meditation, and just about any life and faith topics they want to explore.

**Community**: CLC is a great way to connect with others and form lasting friendships. God's love helps us to be ourselves, share our experience, and support each other through all the ups and downs of life.

**Mission**: CLC supports us in our efforts to live what we believe, to put the Gospel values into action. Explore issues of faith and justice while actively participating in a variety of service opportunities.


The Wednesday gatherings serve as a signpost: reorienting me towards the relational aspect of living, both sacred and secular, and reminding me that I am more than what I do and the degree I am pursuing.

- RG, GSAS ‘27In CLC groups, there is: sharing, prayer, laughter, friendship, service, and support! Each group led by a compassionate, friendly group of student leaders and Jesuit Scholastics who are eager to share their faith and grow in God's love. takes on it's own unique personality, but there is a general format we follow: beginning with prayer, poetry, or song followed by a personal sharing of our weeks followed by some type of "focus exercise" exploring one of the three pillars of faith, community, and service. Groups close with prayer and usually stick around to hang out and have snacks.
