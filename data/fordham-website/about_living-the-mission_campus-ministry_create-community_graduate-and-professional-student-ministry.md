# Graduate and Professional Student Ministry

Campus Ministry invites you to explore the many ways a graduate student like yourself can get involved in our community. Since many graduate and professional students do not live on campus and have varying schedules, we would love to hear from you about your interests.

If you are interested in service, please consider Pedro Arrupe Volunteers (multi faith) or other opportunities through the Center for Community Engaged Learning.

Global Outreach welcomes graduate students to chaperone its many service projects.

The following are retreats open to graduate students:

- Spiritual Exercises in Everyday Life (SEEL)
- Art & Yoga Retreat (Spring)
- Retreat for Faculty, Staff, and Graduate Students (January and May)
- Contemplatio Retreat (January)
- Grad Student Retreat (February)

If you would like to become Catholic or wish to be confirmed, please consider the [Order of Christian Initiation for Adults](https://www.fordham.edu/about/living-the-mission/campus-ministry/catholic-life/sacramental-life/).

If you are interested in a spiritual conversation, we will assist you in finding a spiritual director or a retreat that fits into your schedule. Due to the generosity of Theresa Mao, Fordham alum, we will be offering [weekly gatherings including dinners, programs, conversations, stress reduction sessions, as well as community and prayer](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGIhMSiUEA/_osASUtySzWPxf6LGVQCTA/view?utm_content=DAGIhMSiUEA&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor).

If you have experienced a loss and are interested in bereavement counseling, we are here for you! If faith questions are a concern, you might be interested in having a pastoral conversation with one of our caring campus ministers.

We look forward to hearing from you!
