# Build community with Peer Ministry!

Peer ministers are student leaders within the Lincoln Center community who provide opportunities to form meaningful community and connect with Fordham’s mission of service, spirituality, and social justice. Peer Ministers lead a weekly series called Refreshment every Fall for students new to Fordham, facilitate a Reading in Action group, and provide outreach and inspiration to the campus community.

We seek to represent all the faiths and spiritual backgrounds of our Fordham Ramily! If you are interested in serving as a Peer Minister, please contact Erin Hoffman, [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a5c0cdcac3c3c8c4cb9497e5c3cad7c1cdc4c88bc0c1d0).
