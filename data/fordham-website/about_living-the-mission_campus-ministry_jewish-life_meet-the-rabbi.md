Shalom! Whether you're here to explore, connect, or simply curious, I'm so glad you've found your way to this space.

Rooted in Jewish tradition and open to all, my work centers around co-creating meaningful experiences with students from every background. As part of Fordham’s multi-faith chaplaincy team, I am committed to building a campus where everyone feels seen, heard, and valued.

My journey—shaped by migration, conversion, academic study, and spiritual seeking—has taken me from Germany to the UK, Israel, South Carolina and now New York. I was ordained at the Jewish Theological Seminary, am a trained hospital chaplain, and previously taught religious studies at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, a position I left with tenure. Along the way, I’ve come to deeply appreciate the power of storytelling. Our stories of transformation, resilience, loss, and hope connect us and I am here to listen, learn, and walk with you, wherever you are on your path.

I support Jewish Life at Fordham through Shabbat and holiday celebrations, learning opportunities, and conversations over coffee, in the office, or wherever we find each other. My door is open to all, regardless of religious belief or background.

If you're looking for a moment of connection, a place to reflect, or just someone to talk to, please reach out!
