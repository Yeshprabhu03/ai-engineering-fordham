# Justice and Service

## Serve the community and advocate for a more just society.

Calling on the Fordham community to commit to the challenge of solidarity and activism, as we continuously work for the common good through reciprocal partnerships and accompaniment with our local New York City neighbors.

In accordance with the mission of Fordham University, Campus Ministry offers programs that invite students to step outside of their familiar university lives, walk with people at the margins of society, and in doing so, open their minds and hearts to personal transformation.

We invite you to learn more about ways to deepen your understanding of the intersection between faith and proactivity by joining us for a Common Grounds Conversation or Pedro Arrupe Volunteers service engagement. You can also be part of the Ignatian Family Teach-In for Justice (IFTJ) delegation, where you will experience and learn to nurture compassion, healing and justice in the [Ignatian Tradition and Vision.](https://www.fordham.edu/about/living-the-mission/campus-ministry/justice-and-service/ignatian-family-teach-in-for-justice/)

Additionally, Global Outreach (¡GO!) is a service and cultural immersion program promoting social justice and community engagement. Guided by Fordham’s Jesuit mission, ¡GO! connects students with communities worldwide to explore inequality and advance anti-oppression and anti-racism efforts.
