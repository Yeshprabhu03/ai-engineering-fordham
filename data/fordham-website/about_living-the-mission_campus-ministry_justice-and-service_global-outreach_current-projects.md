South Africa

More specifically, we will spend time with the Kliptown Youth Program (KYP), a community

people of Kliptown and its surrounding communities.

Mississippi

GO! Mississippi will be working with our long-time community partner, Camp Friendship, which is sponsored by St. Christopher Catholic Church in the Dioceses of Jackson, Mississippi, and serves the children of rural, northeast Mississippi. Camp Friendship is located on a bluff 11 miles north of Aberdeen, MS, about 2 hours south of Memphis, TN.

Each summer, Camp Friendship hosts 2 one-week sessions during the month of June, week one in partnership with Fordham GO! and week two in partnership with Iona University. With the help of its enthusiastic volunteers, Camp Friendship fosters a safe and fun environment for children to establish new friendships and build skills such as teamwork, problem-solving, and communication. Teams of 8-10 campers are paired with two counselors for the week. Together, they spend their days doing fun activities such as arts and crafts, team sports, water activities, scavenger hunts, singing camp songs, performing skits, and sitting together for all their meals.


El Paso

This summer a group of ten students will travel to El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez in Mexico to learn about migration and border policies that affect individuals that aspire to settle in a country they can call ‘home’. Now more than ever is it crucial to have a profound understanding of the realities lived by such individuals and to advocate for those who flee from conflict relative to their homeland. The GO! El Paso Team will partner with the Encuentro Project to support those who are experiencing hardships and uncertainty while also educating themselves on the experiences of the surrounding communities.


NYC

This summer’s New York City-based project focuses on some of the most pressing issues affecting people’s daily lives, including food insecurity, housing instability, gentrification, migration, and urban poverty. We will work directly with organizations that participate in tackling these challenges, assisting with food distribution and learning about community-building initiatives. By engaging with these organizations and the people they serve, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the structural barriers that create inequality and explore ways to effect meaningful change. This project also allows students to get to know the city on a deeper level—through the people and communities that compose these five boroughs.


Spring 2025

Ireland

The GO! Ireland team will be immersing themselves in the culture and history of Northern Ireland and will be working with the different communities in Belfast and Derry. We will be learning about the sectarian conflict known as “The Troubles” and will see how people’s lives are still affected by these experiences as well as the efforts that are being made to bring the diverse communities together like the Corrymeela Community. We will also be engaging with organizations that address the current needs of Northern Ireland, particularly Jesuit Refugee Services, to learn about the efforts to welcome new immigrants to the island of Ireland.


Honduras

Along with the Olancho Aid Foundation, we have the privilege of learning about how Hondurans have developed their education system to accommodate every type of student they receive and have faith in one another to help better their communities for the future of their country. Their mission is to “...build transformative pathways for inclusive education that unite and inspire the Honduran community, igniting growth and fulfillment in mind, body, and spirit.” Their vision is to spark a global “community interconnected through education, united in dignity, and driven by collaboration to spark lasting, positive change in Honduras.”

El Salvador

GO! El Salvador is in partnership with Christians for Peace in El Salvador (CRISPAZ), where they will guide us in a faith-based delegation experience where students will learn from the Salvadoran people about their lives, histories, and hopes for the future. Students will learn directly from the Salvadorans about issues such as the impact of war, neo-liberal economics, U.S. foreign policy, migration, mining, the environment, and a tradition of liberating faith.

Peru

During one impactful week in Spring, GO! Peru will immerse itself in the vibrant community, engaging in conversation on community development, economic development, and sustainable practices. In partnership with the Caribbean Social Immersion Program and the Association Jesus Obrero, we aim to further engage in conversation closely with several social and educational institutions to foster a mutual knowledge exchange. We aim to bring back these valuable lessons from our experience to our Fordham, New York, communities and beyond to broaden our commitment to the various social justice issues.
