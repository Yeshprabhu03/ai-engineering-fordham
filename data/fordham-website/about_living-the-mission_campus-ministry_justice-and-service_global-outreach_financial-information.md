# Financial Information

## Project Cost

All projects have an initial flat cost, which takes into consideration the price for travel, food, lodging, and programmatic fees related to the immersion itself. Each project cost will differ based on location: farther distances will most likely see increases in travel costs, and different exchange rates for foreign currencies may result in different program fees.

Typically, we advertise thusly:

$1500 - Continental US

$1800 - Territories & Canada

$2300 - Western International

$2500 - Eastern International

To better understand how costs are allocated, the total cost above can be roughly broken down as follows:

Scholarship and Team Fundraising

Global Outreach also affords partial scholarship to some students upon request and all projects are expected to conduct extensive team-led fundraising efforts to help offset any costs as well.
