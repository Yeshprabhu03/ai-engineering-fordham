# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is GO!

-
No. GO! is focused on cultural-exchange, community, and social justice. While many of GO! partners are faith-based organizations, this is not the main focus. GO! encourages listening, growing, and learning from the communities you visit.

-
No. GO! is an experience that is open to all students, including all faiths, spiritual beliefs, or even not at all. GO! emphasizes the importance of reflection growth but there is no religious requirement to participate.


## Applying to GO!

-
Teams meet weekly for about 2 hours. These meetings consist of learning about the community and partners, fundraise, and build relationships within your team. There are also additional events like the commissioning dinner, an all-day retreat, and fundraisers.

-
While GO! loves the enthusiasm, you can typically only participate in

**one**GO! immersion per academic year to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to participate. Everyone is highly encouraged to apply to other projects in the future and apply for the GO! Director’s Advisory Board. We would love for you to remain involved with GO! -
To become a GO! Leader you have had to precipitate in at least one trip before applying. Leaders are the guide and foundations on their teams. They facilitate reflections, coordinate meetings, and work closely with GO! staff and partners to ensure an amazing experience. Applications usually are sent out by the end of the semester, and email reminders will be sent out so keep an eye on that.


## GO! Costs & Finances

-
The cost for each GO! project can be amounted to travel, food, housing, and additional project expenses like partner costs or donations. These costs vary depending on the location; for example, the farther the location, the more expensive group flights typically are. But Fordham would like to make this experience accessible to all, so we do offer scholarship opportunities.

-
Fordham offers scholarships for those who demonstrate need. To apply, simply offer your relevant information at the end of your participant application; there is no separate form to fill out regarding initial scholarship opportunity. GO! encourages all interested students to provide any of their financial concerns to better inform the scholarship committee.

There are additional scholarship opportunities that are offered over the course of the project cycle.
