# Justice Resources

![students protesting](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/campus-ministry/Justice--Service.jpg)

We encourage our social justice community to open their minds and hearts to the felt and lived experiences of others and to commit ourselves to listening in humility, accepting, learning, growing and acting with conviction. Take what you can from these sources, and go out to the world knowing the injustice that is happening, as well as what is being done to right the wrongs of these injustices and what you can do to make our society more just. We have gathered resources that have been impactful for us and we encourage you to share additional resources by emailing Campus Ministry.
