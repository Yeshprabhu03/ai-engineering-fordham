*Muslim Life at Fordham University*### Our Mission

The Muslim Life on Campus at Fordham University seeks to provide a welcoming and nurturing environment that promotes Islamic values, knowledge, and practices. Through educational programs, multi-faith dialogues, social activities, and community service, our mission is to empower students to integrate their faith into their academic and personal lives, preparing them to be ethical leaders and engaged citizens in a diverse world.

### Our Vision

To foster a vibrant and inclusive Muslim community at Fordham University, a home away from home, where students, faculty, and staff feel empowered, supported, and inspired to grow spiritually, academically, and socially in accordance with Islamic principles.
