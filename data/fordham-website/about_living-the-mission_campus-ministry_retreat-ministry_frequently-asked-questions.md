**What are retreats? **

-
###### Retreats are a one-weekend getaway with the intention of pausing, reflecting, connecting to spirituality, creating community, and having a good time away from school! Each retreat is different, with a different theme or purpose.


**Who can go on retreats? **

-
###### Retreats are open to people of all years at Fordham and all gender identities, sexual orientations, races, ethnicities, faith backgrounds, and abilities.


**Do you have to be religious to go on retreats? **

-
###### No! Retreats are for everyone, wherever you are in your faith journey. We connect to spirituality through prayer, journaling, individual reflection time, small groups, and other activities, and invite you to participate however you feel comfortable.


**Where do retreats take place? **

-
###### We have our very own retreat house in Goshen, NY! It is a beautiful, large house tucked away in the woods, perfect for a refreshing getaway from the city.


**How much do weekend retreats cost?**

-
###### Each weekend retreat has a registration fee of $30 (except for the PRISM Retreat, in which costs are fully covered thanks to a generous donor.) This payment helps to cover the food and supplies used throughout the weekend. We hope that cost is never a deterrent to your participation in our programming-- if finances are a concern for you, or if you have any other questions, please contact Stephanie Roddy at
