# Campus Ministry Retreats

Each retreat is unique but all find fullness in the grace and love of God, and welcome people of all faith backgrounds and experiences. Peace, hope, laughter, joy, faith, healing, wisdom, friendship (and food!) are among the many blessings we have all received on retreats.

While most of our retreats are for undergraduate students, we also have retreat opportunities for faculty, staff, and graduate students, as well as alumni. We also work with Fordham-affiliated groups who are looking for a retreat location.

Weekend Retreats take place (with the exception of Contemplatio Silent Retreat) at our beautiful Philip H. McGrath, S.J. Retreat House in Goshen, NY. Nestled in the foothills of the Catskill Mountains, our house is a quiet retreat from the hustle and bustle of New York City -- approximately 90 minutes by RamVan from the Rose Hill Campus. Initially a true home, there’s plenty of room to stretch out, socialize, and individually reflect both inside and on the grounds.

Learn more about each of the retreats below and find out which one might be best for you! Please contact us at any time for more information.
