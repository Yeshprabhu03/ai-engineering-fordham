# Bereavement

There is no grief like the grief that does not speak.

- Henry Wadsworth LongfellowWhen you experience the death of someone you love, your world gets turned upside down. You may feel vulnerable, afraid, sad, confused, angry, hopeless, numb, or isolated. You may feel relief or release. Death can impact so many aspects of your life. You may find it harder to concentrate, eat, sleep, get out of bed, go to class or work, or even be around other people. It might feel like these feelings will never end and you will never feel normal again.

When you are suffering emotionally, life can seem hard to manage, especially when everyone around you seems to be happy and engaged in life. You may wonder if or how God fits into it all. Many students, faculty, and staff tell us that when they are going through a time of grief it helps to speak with someone who understands how painful it is to lose someone. Campus Ministry is a safe and confidential space where you can talk about your loss and gain insight and perspective.

Grief is a completely natural response to loss. There is no right or wrong way to process the many feelings that tend to surface when someone you love has died. Periodically we hold in person and virtual groups to support members of the Fordham community through the grieving process. If you are a student, faculty or staff member and would like to meet with someone, please contact: [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) // McShane Center - 212 CMCE // 718-817-4501
