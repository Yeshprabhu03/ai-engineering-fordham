# Pastoral Conversation

College is a time of many transitions. Adjusting to the demands of college can be very stressful. You may find it helpful to know that there are many caring and compassionate Campus Ministers available to listen to your concerns. Many students find that some of their previously held assumptions about religion and faith get challenged during college. While this is completely normal, it can be unsettling. If you find that you are wondering about how or if God fits into your life, we invite you to speak with one of our Campus Ministers. Regardless of your belief system, all members of the Fordham community are most welcome to talk one-on-one with a Campus Minister about their concerns in a confidential setting.
