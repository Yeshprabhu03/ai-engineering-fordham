# Spiritual Direction

## For the Fordham Community

Do you ever wish that you could deepen your relationship with God? Sometimes life can get overwhelming when trying to balance academics, work, and social lives that it can be hard to notice God at work. Spiritual direction provides an opportunity for students, faculty, and staff at Fordham to meet one-on-one with a Campus Minister and talk about their relationship with God.

Spiritual direction is an opportunity to speak about your spiritual journey to a capable director, who will accompany you as you discern where and how God is at work in your life. The primary role of a spiritual director is to listen to you and to help you become more attentive to God’s presence in the ordinary circumstances of your life.

Spiritual direction meetings, which are confidential, are designed to assist you in responding to God, who desires to meet you wherever you are on your journey. Typically, spiritual direction involves meeting about once every three to six weeks, depending on your preference and availability.

If you are interested in deepening your relationship with God, why not consider speaking with one of our spiritual directors? Please connect with the Office of Campus Ministry.
