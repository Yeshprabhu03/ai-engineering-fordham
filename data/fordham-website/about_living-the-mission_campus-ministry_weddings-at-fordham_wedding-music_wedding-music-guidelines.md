# Wedding Music Guidelines

To ensure that the music at your wedding is of the highest possible quality there are several regulations we ask you to follow:

**Organists**

Guest organists are not allowed. In general, the director of music serves as organist for weddings at Fordham University Church. In the event that he is unable to serve at your wedding, a qualified and University-approved substitute will be provided to replace him.

**Vocalists, Cantors, Instrumentalists**

Cantors and instrumentalists listed in this brochure are the designated musicians for weddings at Fordham University Church. Guest musicians are permitted to add solos at the Prelude, the Preparation of Gifts, and at Communion.

However, these musicians must:

- Be trained and experienced musicians comfortable performing in public.
- Be able to arrive one hour prior to the ceremony with any solos prepared and comfortable with only a brief rehearsal. That is the only rehearsal time available for the guest musician and the organist.
- Be able to provide the organist with a copy of any solos in the key to be performed.

Please note that if you choose to use a guest musician(s), an additional $100 will be added to the organist’s fee. The organist and musicians do not attend wedding rehearsals.

**Starting Time of your Wedding and Prelude Music**

As stated during the wedding reservation interview, your wedding is expected to start on time. *Prelude music will begin 10 minutes before the scheduled starting time of your ceremony. Please note that the **organist** is not responsible to continue prelude music after the scheduled start of the ceremony.*

**Payment**

All musicians *must* be paid prior to the start of the ceremony. All fees are made payable to the individual in the form of cash or check and are due at the Office of Campus Ministry no later than one month before the wedding.

**Policy Concerning Liturgical Music**

Your wedding is a liturgy of the church; therefore, all musical texts must be sacred. Texts should be drawn from scripture or have religious themes. Certain parts for the Wedding Mass should be sung; particularly, the Psalm after the First Reading, Acclamation before the Gospel, and the Eucharistic Prayer Acclamations. Cantors are available to help encourage your guests to participate in this music.
