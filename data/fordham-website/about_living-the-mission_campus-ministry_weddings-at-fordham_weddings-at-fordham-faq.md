# Weddings at Fordham FAQ

## Calendar/Waiting List

**How long is the waiting list?**

We don’t have a waiting list. It’s first come, first served, and dates are subject to availability. We accommodate most requests.

**How far in advance can you book a wedding date?**

There is a six-month minimum preparation time required for Catholic weddings.

### Wedding Preparation

**Can a priest from Fordham officiate the wedding?**

If there is a priest you knew while at Fordham, you are welcome to reach out to him and ask him to officiate your wedding. Since Fordham is not a parish, Campus Ministry cannot supply a priest or deacon. You must arrange for a priest or deacon to officiate the marriage yourself.

**How do we register for Pre-Cana?**[Visit the Archdiocese of New York Family Life Office.](https://nyfamilylife.org/marriage-preparation/)

**What role does our wedding planner play during the liturgy?**

We can have up to 4 weddings per week and organize over 50 weddings per year. Because of this our staff has a great deal of experience with running weddings in our space. We ask that your wedding planner allow us to manage the ceremony from the processional to recessional.

### Items at the University Church

**Is Alcohol Permitted?**

No. As we are sure you can imagine, alcohol is best saved for the rehearsal dinner and reception.

**Are flower arrangements and decorations allowed in the church?**

Yes. However, the stones, stained glass, marble, and oak radiate the Gothic beauty and sacred character of University Church, so less is more. We do not allow cloth runners, and we do not allow anything—such as rice, flower petals, etc.—to be tossed on the floor. Flower arrangements may be set to the side of the main altar, not exceeding the height of the altar, and on the high altar. Because of space constraints, they are not allowed in the church vestibule. Pew decorations are also permitted. All flowers and pew decorations must be removed from the church within 30 minutes after your ceremony.

**How can we secure pew decorations to the ends of the pews?**

You may use materials including clips, rubber bands, and twist-ties to secure pew decorations. Tape, glue, and/or other adhesive materials are not allowed because they may damage the wood.

**When can our florist arrive to start decorating the church?**

The florist can deliver flowers after 11 a.m. the day of your ceremony. They should come to the main sacristy door to unload. There is a 30-minute time frame for setup before the wedding liturgy, and no earlier, due to other weddings taking place the same afternoon.

**Does the University Church provide altar candles?**

The church provides the altar candles.

### Guests

**Where can guests park for the wedding ceremony?**

For both the rehearsal and wedding itself, the security guards at Fordham’s main entrance (opposite the New York Botanical Garden, **GPS address: 2691 Southern Boulevard, Bronx, NY 10458**) will have the names of the bride and groom, and will inform your wedding party and guests of the parking arrangements. There is no additional cost for guests to park on campus. Location of guest parking will be determined that day. The bride’s limousine will park in front of Martyrs’ Court so that the bride may walk up the main pathway to the front of the church.

Should your guests need to park in the main parking garage near the Southern Boulevard entrance, assistance will be provided for persons with mobility issues. Please ask the security guard to call a car to transport any physically challenged guest. Every effort will be made to ensure guest parking for your wedding at the University Church is as convenient as possible.

**Are restrooms available for our guests?**

Please be advised, the historic Fordham University Church has one handicap accessible bathroom. While guests are welcomed to use it, there are additional restrooms around campus, located near the University Church.

### Photography and Video

**Can guests take photos and video during the ceremony?**

We suggest only professional wedding photography during the ceremony. The church has no objection to professional photographers taking photographs of the wedding, nor to the liturgy being filmed by a videographer arranged by the couple being married. It is important that the photographer and/or videographer introduce themselves to the priest and wedding minister before the wedding begins and adhere to all instructions.

**Is drone photography OK?**

No. Drones are not permitted on campus.

### Music

**May we have a friend/family member perform a musical piece at our ceremony?**

All questions regarding music during a wedding ceremony in the University Church must be directed to Fordham’s director of liturgical music and organist, Robert Minotti. He can be reached at 718-817-4504 or at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f5989c9b9a81819cb5939a87919d9498db909180).

### Rehearsal

**Who should attend the rehearsal?**

It is essential that the bride, groom, and officiant attend the rehearsal. We also ask that lectors, gift-bearers, eucharistic ministers, members of the processional/recessional, and anyone else involved with the liturgy also attend.

**What if our officiant cannot attend the rehearsal?**

Please notify the Office of Campus Ministry as soon as possible if your officiant will not be present at the rehearsal. We will make proper adjustments to make sure your rehearsal runs accordingly.

**What should we bring to the rehearsal?**

You need to bring your New York state civil marriage license. You may also bring programs and any other items for the ceremony, which we will keep for your convenience.

**How long is the rehearsal?**

The rehearsal will last for one (1) hour. You must show up on time, as no extra time will be allotted for the rehearsal if you are late.

**What do we do at the rehearsal?**

A wedding minister will assist your presider with facilitating the entire ceremony from processional to recessional. The rehearsal is also the time to clarify any last details with the wedding coordinator and clergy regarding the ceremony.

**How do we apply for a New York civil marriage license?**[View the New York State Health Department site for information about getting married.](https://www.health.ny.gov/publications/4210/)

**Are buses permitted on campus?**

Before you hire any buses for your guests, you must speak with Public Safety and Security to ensure the buses can be accommodated (718-817-2222).

### Outside the Church

**Can we throw anything outside?**

No. Nothing is to be thrown—flower petals, rice, birdseed, etc.

**While we’re taking pictures, can we have a table set with refreshments for our guests?**

No.

### Timing on the Day of Wedding

**For how long do we have the church reserved?**

From 30 minutes before your ceremony’s start time until 90 minutes after. For instance, if you have a 2 p.m. wedding, you have the church from 1:30 - 3:30 p.m. You and your party must be out of the church and can not continue to take photos in front of the church after that time.. You can still take pictures on the Rose Hill campus, but please be sensitive to the next wedding and do not intrude on their time and space. Scenic locations include near Cuniffee House and by the Hughes Hall fountain, to name a few.

**When will we be finished with the ceremony?**

The ceremony lasts either 40 minutes or one hour, depending on whether the rite of matrimony takes place within Mass. This is something to discuss with your priest or deacon.

Again, your church reservation lasts for two hours—30 minutes before the start of the ceremony, and one hour and 30 minutes for the wedding itself and removal of decorations. You can also take pictures in any leftover time.
