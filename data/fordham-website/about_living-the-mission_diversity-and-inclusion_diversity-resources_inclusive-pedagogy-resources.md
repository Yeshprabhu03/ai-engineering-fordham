**Teaching**

[The Student Experience Project has a useful handout](https://studentexperienceproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Election-support-resource.pdf)on concrete strategies for addressing traumatic situations.- The
[University of Michigan's Center for Research on Learning and Teaching has a series of blog posts](https://crlt.umich.edu/blog/after-election-2020-moving-reaction-action)on teaching in the aftermath of the election. It can get kind of abstract, but it's worth reading if you want to address the election directly. [UM also has a useful Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tuMuMVnI7soHLcTNxzCTqcpkun0ASHW_WvNuxphyyxA/)on handling classroom conflict.
