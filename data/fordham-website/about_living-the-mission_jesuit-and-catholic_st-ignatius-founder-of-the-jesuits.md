## Passion

Ignatius was a man of great passion, and so he exhorted his young Jesuits to think boldly, to imagine creatively, to love enthusiastically, to labor tirelessly, and to give generously. That vision has endured for centuries and ardently persists here at Fordham University amid the hurried pace of New York City.

At Fordham, students from all different backgrounds and faith traditions gather to learn and to live. As a Jesuit university, we invite teachers and students alike to find God in all things: in our studies, work, and recreation. In the encounter with truth, beauty, and goodness, we discern the fingerprints of God. We seek to revel in creation and celebrate it with an undying gratitude and humility, just as Ignatius so passionately encouraged his original followers to do.

Your destination may be as unknown as it was for Ignatius, but your starting point is clear: right here at Fordham, with other pilgrims, both young and old, you, too can seek a life marked by learning, service, and faith!
