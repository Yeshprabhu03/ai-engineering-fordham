# Five Goals

The Initiative works toward the following five goals:


1) To identify and **cultivate student leaders committed to becoming activists, policy-makers, and researchers** who are dedicated to affirming the human dignity of migrants and prepared to address complex challenges related to migration in US society into the future.

2) To support Fordham students, faculty, and staff in the practice of *accompaniment** *with migrant communities at the Mexico-USA border, in the New York metropolitan area and at Fordham itself.

3) To support faculty and student *research** *that serves migrant communities and migrant-serving organizations at the Mexico-USA border and in the New York metropolitan area.

4) To cultivate *sustainable, collaborative relationships** *with local, national and international academic, policy and community-based organizations who serve as partners to expand accompaniment with migrant communities as well as research that serves these communities.

5) To serve as a **model and leader in migration accompaniment for Jesuit institutions **across the United States, promoting spiritual-affective, intellectual and practical engagement with migration that leads to long-term personal, professional and intellectual growth and advocates for policy change both within and outside of academic communities. We are in the early stages of a collaboration with Boston College to establish a migration network among US Jesuit universities where we can collectively activate this goal.
