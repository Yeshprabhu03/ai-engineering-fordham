# Teaching and Scholarship

Central to the mission of Fordham University is the teaching and scholarship done by faculty members.

Although each academic discipline establishes norms for excellence in teaching and scholarship, Fordham's Catholic, Jesuit mission and identity can provide valuable resources to faculty members. Even more, the work of faculty members can contribute to Fordham's mission in ways that are appropriate to their own fields, commitments, and beliefs.

Fostering these mutual benefits requires deepening understanding, dialogue, and imagination. Often it also takes time and exploration.

Fordham is committed to the development of faculty members as partners in the mission of Jesuit education. The following websites show a range of opportunities for learning and appreciating what that might mean.
