# AJCU Leadership Institute

### Overview

[The AJCU Leadership Institute](https://ajcunet.edu/formation-programs/ignatian-leadership-seminar/) (AJCU-LI) is an Ignatian professional development program rooted in Ignatian leadership, pedagogy and spirituality. This year-long formational program (formerly known as the Jesuit Leadership Seminar) features monthly virtual sessions with AJCU leaders and a four-day in-person Summer Institute.

Through the Leadership Institute, participants build a network of peers in leadership positions across the AJCU network; gain a foundation in Jesuit higher education and spirituality; and learn how to apply Ignatian leadership principles to today’s challenges. The program is designed for senior administrators and faculty who are either new to Jesuit higher education or have recently assumed new leadership responsibilities.

### Qualification

Mid to Senior Level Administrators (and sometimes Faculty) who have significant institutional influence and may be new to Jesuit Education or have been at Fordham for a while and are invested in the Jesuit mission but have never had formal introduction to it.

The AJCU Leadership Institute was - and continues to be - a transformative experience. As a relatively new administrator at Fordham, the chance to meet with colleagues across the nation working to integrate mission at their institutions and sharing best practices was a defining moment in my professional development. I encourage anyone pursuing a career in Jesuit higher education to take this opportunity.
