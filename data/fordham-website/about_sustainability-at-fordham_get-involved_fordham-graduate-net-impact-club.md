We are a student-run club at the Gabelli School of Business that promotes socially responsible and environmentally sustainable practices in business. We are a part of a global community of mission-driven Net Impact Chapters determined to make a difference! Our chapter is locally organized and focused on the interest of our community by aligning the vision of mobilizing next-generation leaders in order to use their skills and careers to make a positive impact on the world.

As a member, you can discover new employment opportunities, meet like-minded individuals, and take part in community initiatives that make a difference in people's lives. We will organize network events, panel discussions, workshops, and office visits to explore sustainability and how businesses can make an impact on communities.
