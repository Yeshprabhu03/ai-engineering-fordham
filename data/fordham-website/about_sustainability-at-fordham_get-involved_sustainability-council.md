# Sustainability Council

## Mission

Over five years ago Fordham’s President, Joseph McShane, SJ, joined Mayor Bloomberg’s 2017 challenge to New York City institutions of higher education to reduce greenhouse emission 30% by 2017. Mr. Marco Valera, VP for Facilities Management, was asked to Chair the University’s Sustainability Committee and to develop a plan to meet this challenge. In collaboration with Great Forest, and independent sustainability consultant, the Council seeks to foster a university wide discussion among all members of the Fordham community.

### Membership

The Committee, which consists of administrators, faculty, staff, students and consultants, meet throughout the year to discuss keys issues such as improving recycling, university-wide energy and greenhouse gas reduction initiatives, including other Sustainability efforts on campus

We each have our vocation-the thing to do is answer the call. We each have something to give.
