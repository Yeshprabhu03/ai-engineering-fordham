# Campus Recycling

A uniform recycling program has been established across all campuses for construction debris. In 2015, an intensive study found that more than 208,000 pounds of paper, cardboard, plastic, glass, and metal were being recycled and diverted from the University’s waste stream annually. During move-out, students donate goods, clothes, and furnishings, with almost two tons of items repurposed or recycled.

### What We Recycle

- Paper, cardboard, aluminum cans, plastics, glass
- Toner cartridges at the print shop and for individual users; printers provided by cartridge manufactures' envelope such as HP
- Construction debris and materials (as part of LEED projects)
- Used furniture through local charities
- Fluorescent bulbs

Over 90,000 lbs. of construction related debris collected from the renovation of Hughes Hall was recycled in 2012.
