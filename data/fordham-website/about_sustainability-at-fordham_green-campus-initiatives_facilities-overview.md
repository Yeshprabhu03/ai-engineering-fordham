# Facilities Overview

Fordham's Facilities Management Group is responsible for maintaining over 42 buildings (comprising of 4.7 million square feet) which are dispersed throughout four campuses (the Bronx, Manhattan, West Harrison & Armonk). We are committed to designing and constructing new buildings as well as maintaining our historic buildings in a manner that ensures environmental sustainability.

The University has been recognized for its commitment to building green and several buildings on campus have achieved [Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design](http://www.usgbc.org/) (LEED) certification. LEED certification is often considered the preeminent sustainable building certification program in the world.

Another sustainable and increasingly used building practice is preservation and renovation (also known as [adaptive reuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_reuse)). Fordham's 179-year-old Rose Hill Campus in the Bronx is home to several landmark buildings, including the University Church (built in 1839) and Cunniffe House (built in 1841). These landmark structures help form the historic core of the Bronx campus and are surrounded by many other buildings that were constructed prior to the Second World War. As such, the Facilities Management Group is dedicated to carefully preserve these historic edifices and renovate these buildings in a manner that can accommodate the needs of a vibrant 21st century institution of higher education.

At the heart of the Lincoln Center Campus is Robert Moses Plaza which is a green roof that covers the Quinn Library and serves as a gathering space for the University community and its neighbors.

## The Louis Calder Center

[The Louis Calder Center](/about/campuses/the-louis-calder-center/) is a biological field station established in 1967 for ecological research and environmental education. The Calder Center consists of 113 forested acres maintained in a natural state, with 13 buildings totaling 37,630 gross square feet. The Calder Center provides opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to gain hands-on skills in field biology and environmental studies. The Calder Center is one of the few field stations in North America with relatively undisturbed communities near a large urban center.

## Green Buildings

All new buildings will be designed from an energy standpoint to achieve the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) New Construction Silver rating, ensuring that all new properties are environmentally responsible.
