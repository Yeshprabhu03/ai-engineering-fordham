As a department transporting over 250,000 people annually between our Bronx Rose Hill campus garage and our Lincoln Center campus, employees and students who otherwise might have used their cars to travel, the Ram Van plays no small part in contributing to Fordham's carbon footprint. Since 2008, the Ram Van has also played a proportionally large role in leading Fordham's sustainability makeover.

In 2023, Fordham’s Department of University Transportation acquired three hybrid minivans, including a wheelchair-accessible minivan, to replace gas-powered minivans previously used for wheelchair-accessible requests, trips to the Calder Center, and charter trip services. The vans use less gas, produce less Co2**, **and can run up to 560 miles on one tank of gas.

Fordham will shift its remaining vehicle fleet, including Public Safety vehicles, to primarily electric vehicles (EV’s) as EV technology evolves. Currently, the University has nine hybrid vehicles in its fleet. Eight EV charging stations are installed at the Rose Hill campus garage, with more planned.
