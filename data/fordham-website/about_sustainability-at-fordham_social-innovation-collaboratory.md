# Social Innovation Collaboratory

## We are a Network of Changemakers

We are a network of Fordham University **students, faculty, administrators, alumni** and **community members** working together to promote **social innovation** for the achievement of social justice, social entrepreneurship, and environmental sustainability.

### We are an AshokaU Changemaker Campus

**AshokaU's global network of 45 Changemaker Campuses** is advancing an education that develops interdisciplinary and entrepreneurial skills. AshokaU breaks down barriers to institutional change and encourages social innovation in higher education.
