### Calder Center – Undergraduate Opportunities

[The goal of the educational programs at the LCC](/about/campuses/the-louis-calder-center/) is to provide university students opportunities to learn about the natural world through hands-on experience in the field. Students are instructed in methods and conduct scientific research in relatively undisturbed ecosystems, yet near an urban center. The station also provides the first opportunities for many urban students to examine the natural world first hand. Undergraduate students can take advantage of a number of opportunities, including summer courses taught at the station, field Trips for undergraduate courses, Honors theses and research tutorials, and the Calder Summer Undergraduate Research (CSUR), which offers undergraduate students opportunities to conduct their own independent research studies in the summer, with close instruction from Fordham faculty members.

### Service Learning Program

The central idea with service-learning is that students are testing the concepts or practicing the skills of a course through experience in the community. This experience is in service to an underrepresented or marginalized group for a mutually beneficial experience. With Service Learning Courses, the service experience can be fully integrated into the methods of learning in the course and enhance classroom discussions.

### Internships and Undergraduate Job Opportunities

Fordham University enjoys partnerships with three premier environmental education organizations located on the historic Bronx River in New York City: Bronx River Alliance, New York Botanical Garden, and Wildlife Conservation Society. These partnerships allow environmental studies majors to intern for one or more semesters in order to gain invaluable hands-on learning and professional experience, which can be used for credit in an internship course.
