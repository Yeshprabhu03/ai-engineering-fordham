When you watch movies, what do you enjoy the most: drama, action, comedy, or documentaries? Do you follow certain actors and musicians? Movies are reflections, celebrations, and sometimes critiques of culture. In this class, you will improve your writing, speaking, and listening skills through an examination of various films that are essential to understanding American culture. Special emphasis is on writing reflections and sharing comments while understanding idiomatic language as well as recognizing different interpretations in selected scenes. Enjoying the movies is a bonus! |

Do you want to make a positive impact on society? The course encourages student engagement in the local community through volunteer opportunities.
