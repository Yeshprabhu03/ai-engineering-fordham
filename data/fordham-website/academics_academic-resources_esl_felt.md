# Fordham English Language Test (FELT)

Each year the Institute of American Language and Culture (IALC) administers the Fordham English Language Test (FELT), a placement test for English composition courses. Similar to the placement tests students take for their initial course in Mandarin, Spanish, etc., this test is used to ensure you begin your English language study at Fordham at the appropriate level. The FELT is required for all undergraduate students who indicated a primary language other than English on their application for admission. Even if you studied in the U.S. or at a school abroad with English-medium instruction, the FELT is still required. Graduate students admitted to a program in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) with a condition that they must take the Fordham English Language Test (FELT) are required to take the exam. Your participation helps us provide appropriate services and support to all students.

There are two FELT waiver options. First, if you have successfully completed college-level composition courses at a post-secondary institution (university) outside of Fordham, please indicate the class on the registration form. Second, for select AP/IB courses, a waiver is available based on your test scores. Please complete the FELT registration/waiver form to schedule your assessment or apply for a waiver.*

The FELT takes approximately two hours (140 minutes maximum) and includes a multiple-choice grammar section as well as a reading and essay response section. You will be given a short essay or article to read (e.g. an article from the *New York Times*), and you will be asked to summarize the article and respond to a prompt in approximately 300 words.

Once you have completed the registration form, you will be sent a link to a practice test.
