***Estimated living expenses for the calendar year include holidays.


Private Tuition

**Approximately $1100 per a 10-week session**. Private students who are registered as part-time Fordham University students may take up to 30 hours per semester.

## Refund Policy

We hope you never need to withdraw from a class or program. However, if unforeseen circumstances mean that you must, please come immediately to the IALC office and inform an administrator of your intention to withdraw. You will be asked to complete an Add/Drop Form and a Refund Request Form at the office. I-20/F1 students must maintain a full-time course load.

Full tuition (less the non-refundable deposit for I-20/F1 students) is refunded if you withdraw before the first class meeting. During the academic year, the following refund schedule applies:

- An 85% refund is granted if a student withdraws during the first week of classes.
- A 70% refund is granted if a student withdraws during the second week of classes.
- A 55% refund is granted if a student withdraws during the third week of classes.
- A 40% refund is granted if a student withdraws during the fourth week of classes.
- No refunds are granted once the fifth week of classes has begun.

During the summer, the refund amount is reduced after each class meeting rather than each week.

In the unlikely event that the IALC cancels a class for which you have registered, you will receive a 100% refund.

## Late Fees

Tuition fees are due by the first day of class and must be paid in full by the end of the first week. If students pay their fees later than the first week of classes, late fees will be applied on the second week of the *following* month. (Ex: If classes start September 6, the late fee will apply the second week of October.) Late fees increase on a monthly basis. Students who fail to pay the balance of their tuition will be unable to extend their I-20 at Fordham and will not be able to enroll in subsequent semesters at the University.
