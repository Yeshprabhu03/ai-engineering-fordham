## About the Office for International Services

The Office for International Services (OIS) is dedicated to supporting Fordham University's international students, scholars, and faculty as they navigate academic and personal life in the U.S. We provide comprehensive services and resources to help our international community maintain their immigration status, achieve their academic goals, and experience cultural exchange. OIS offers guidance on visa regulations, work authorizations, and travel, as well as adjusting to life at Fordham and New York City. We also organize events and workshops to foster global connections and help international students thrive on campus and beyond.
