Refer to[Fordham’s Immigration-related Emergencies](https://www.fordham.edu/updates-on-evolving-political-landscape/#immigration)page for further guidance.

## New Guidance

Nonimmigrants must ensure they fulfill the following two obligations:

*Carry**their immigration registration document*– A printout of**an electronic Form I-94**meets this requirement ([8 CFR 1.4(f)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/part-1/section-1.4#p-1.4(f)))- To obtain your I-94, access the
[I-94 Official Website](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/home)and select “Get Most Recent I-94.” The I-94 electronic record should reflect F-1 (or J-1) as your class of Admission and “D/S” for Admit Until Date. Print the I-94 and carry it with you at all times.

- To obtain your I-94, access the
*Report**address changes within 10 days*- All noncitizens in the U.S. must report any change of address within 10 days of the change

Under **8 CFR 214.2(f)(17)**, F1 students must inform DHS and the DSO of any legal changes to the student’s name or of any change of address, within 10 days of the change, in a manner prescribed by the school. A student can satisfy the requirement in 8 CFR 265.1 of notifying DHS by providing a notice of a change of address within 10 days to the DSO, and the DSO in turn must enter the information in SEVIS within 21 days of notification. We recommend that all non-immigrant community should file an AR-11, in abundance of caution.

You can find the AR-11 at [www.uscis.gov/ar-11](https://www.uscis.gov/ar-11) - and carry with you.

**December 17, 2025 Message from OIS: Proclamation of Dec. 16, 2025; Visa Ban Effective Jan. 1, 2026**Dear International Students,


Yesterday, President Trump issued a[presidential proclamation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/12/restricting-and-limiting-the-entry-of-foreign-nationals-to-protect-the-security-of-the-united-states/)that either fully or partially bars visa issuance for nationals of 39 countries and those traveling with Palestinian Authority-issued documents, effective January 1, 2026.The countries subject to full and partial restrictions include: Afghanistan, Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burma (Myanmar), Burundi, Chad, Côte d ‘Ivoire, Cuba, Dominica, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Gabon, Haiti, Iran, Laos, Libya, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Republic of Congo, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, The Gambia, Togo, Tonga, Turkmenistan**, Venezuela, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe.


** Turkmenistan – The proclamation suspends only immigrant visas.

By its terms, the revised travel ban proclamation applies only to nationals of the above countries who:-
Are outside of the United States on January 1, 2026; and

-
Do not have a valid visa on January 1, 2026.


Individuals currently holding valid visas may continue to use those visas for travel to the United States; the proclamation explicitly states that existing visas will not be revoked as a result of the proclamation. However, such individuals may be subject to enhanced screening at ports of entry, and possible confusion regarding the scope of the exemption for travelers with currently valid visas.

For incoming international students seeking visas from impacted countries: You are encouraged to continue with your visa application process. Continue submitting all required documentation for your visa application as promptly as possible. If you are scheduled for a visa interview, proceed as planned with the interview unless the consulate advises you otherwise.


As always, the required documents for travel and re-entry into the U.S. as an F-1 student are: a valid passport, a valid F-1 visa, and a valid I-20/DS-2019 with a valid travel signature. For more information, please visit[OIS International Student Travel](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/academic-resources/international-services/students/current-students/travel/).We would also like to remind you that students who encounter an immigration-related emergency can call Fordham Public Safety immediately at 718-817-2222 (Rose Hill) or 212-636-6076 (Lincoln Center). Public Safety is staffed 24/7 and will connect the student with external legal resources based on the situation, including a round-the-clock travel emergency hotline as appropriate.

**May 13, 2025 Message from OIS:****Update Regarding Visa Revocations**Dear International Students and Scholars,


You should be aware that the U.S. Department of State has again begun revoking the visas of international students and faculty, as of Thursday, May 8, in Fordham’s case. The process is different from its previous actions: in the current process, while the international student or faculty member’s visa is revoked, their SEVIS record may remain active. This means the international student or faculty member may stay in the U.S. to continue their studies or scholarly work, but if they leave the U.S., they will not be readmitted.

Visa revocation notices are being sent to the email address you used to apply for the visa;**therefore it is important for you to check that email frequently, and certainly prior to leaving the U.S. for any reason.*** You can check your visa status anytime at:[https://ceac.state.gov/](https://links.crm.fordham.edu/els/v2/wkDWJrG~~ABE/T0c2SjhGZVZjQzRQR0ZHUWNJcGJtQ2k3NEhYNmthS05uWlFBb3ZsTHJHVkhiL2xlMS9CU0JFelR6UVpBbjRhR3QzRGd0TnQvOEJUWTU3THlwc1Z1b3BvRzhMYjdUZFBLVEUzUllWN09rSlU9S0/)(for Visa Application Type, select “NONIMMIGRANT VISA (NIV).”CEACStatTracker/Status.aspx **If an attorney or law firm filed the visa application on your behalf from the firm’s email address, we strongly encourage you to remain in contact with them to ensure you are informed of any changes in your visa status.*

**April 9, 2025 Message to the International Student Community:****Fwd: Update on Evolving Political Landscape**Dear International Students, Scholars, and Faculty,


I understand that the evolving landscape around immigration and student visas is causing significant anxiety and concern for many students and families. President Tetlow's message conveyed the University's unwavering support for our international community, and I want to echo that commitment. My office is closely monitoring the situation and is here to provide you with specific and timely guidance to help you navigate these challenges.

As the President referenced in her message, should you encounter an immigration-related emergency, call Fordham Public Safety at 718-817-2222 (Rose Hill) or 212-636-6076 (Lincoln Center). Inform the officer of your immigration emergency, and Public Safety will put you in touch with the University resources appropriate to your situation.

Should such an emergency arise, Fordham is committed to providing support. Fordham has engaged the legal services of an external immigration law firm to provide initial, complimentary legal consultations. These consultations are specifically available to current Fordham students, faculty, and staff facing emergency immigration-related issues, including removal proceedings, visa revocation, and detainment upon arrival at a U.S. port of entry. The initial consultation is intended to offer preliminary legal guidance and assessment of critical immigration situations. The consultation covers the first meeting. Should you need ongoing legal representation, you will need a separate agreement directly with the lawyers, or you may engage an immigration law firm of your choosing.

Lastly, I encourage you to be aware of scams. We have heard reports that international students are being targeted with fake calls, emails, and letters that appear to be from a federal agency. Such scams threaten deportation unless an immediate payment is made for an immigration violation. Know that federal agencies never contact you to demand immediate payment to avoid arrest or prosecution, nor will federal agencies ask for personal details like your Social Security number, bank information, or passwords over the phone. Should you receive any communication (including email and/or phone calls) from the federal government related to your visa or status, you should immediately contact thefor guidance and support.**Office of International Services**

If my office can be of any assistance, please reach out anytime. Otherwise, OIS will be back in-touch with updates as necessary.

Thank you,

Salvatore C. Longarino

**January 28, 2025 Message to International Student Community:****Requirements to Carry Current Electronic Form I-94 and CURRENT Travel History**As the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) intensifies its immigration compliance efforts (for example, see the January 25, 2025 executive order

[Protecting The United States From Foreign Terrorists And Other National Security And Public Safety Threats](https://www.nafsa.org/regulatory-information/executive-order-protecting-united-states-foreign-terrorists-and-other)), nonimmigrant students and scholars should review these important requirements and other important guidelines for maintaining immigration status.Nonimmigrants must ensure they fulfill the following two obligations:

– A printout of**Carry**their immigration registration document**an electronic Form I-94**meets this requirement ([8 CFR 1.4(f)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/part-1/section-1.4#p-1.4(f)))- To obtain your I-94, access the
[I-94 Official Website](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/home)and select “Get Most Recent I-94.” The I-94 electronic record should reflect F-1 (or J-1) as your class of Admission and “D/S” for Admit Until Date. Print the I-94 and carry it with you at all times. - If you have trouble obtaining your I-94 or if any information appears incorrect, contact
[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b6d9dfc5f6d0d9c4d2ded7db98d3d2c3) - All noncitizens in the U.S. must report any change of address within 10 days of the change.**Report**address changes within 10 days- Email
[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#17787e6457717865737f767a39727362)to report your new address.

Thus, to comply with INA 264(e), nonimmigrants should carry their

**I-94 printout**at all times. It is also recommended to carry any other relevant status documents with you, such as**Form I-20**(for F-1 students),**DS-2019**(for J-1 visa holders), or a valid**EAD card**if authorized for employment under OPT.In addition, to prove identity, nonimmigrants should carry a

**government-issued photo ID.**For more information, please refer to this

[NAFSA advisory](https://www.nafsa.org/professional-resources/browse-by-interest/requirements-carry-immigration-registration-document-and-report-change).

**December 12, 2024****Message to International Student Community:****Immigration and Travel Considerations Under New Federal Administration**Dear Fordham,


As we prepare for the transition to a new federal administration, we want to remind you that changes in immigration policies, regulations, and procedures may occur. At this time, it is too early to determine if or when these changes might take place or how they might impact Fordham’s international community. The Office for International Services (OIS) is closely monitoring developments and will keep you updated as new information becomes available. Additionally, if you come across any specific information or concerns, please don’t hesitate to bring it to our attention so that we may investigate further.

In the meantime, we encourage you to keep the following points in mind:**1. Immigration Situations Are Unique**

Every international student’s circumstances are different. If you have questions or concerns, please contact OIS for guidance tailored to your situation. Avoid making decisions based on social media, news reports, or speculation about potential new policies. Instead, rely on official communications from government agencies and guidance from OIS.**2. Policy Changes Take Time**

The new administration cannot impose Executive Orders until after the presidential inauguration on January 20, 2025. Even then, Executive Orders and new laws may take time to implement. The University will offer timely updates to international students and guidance, if possible, whenever new laws or Executive Orders are finalized.

(see #3 below)**3. Winter Travel and Visa Considerations**

With the new administration taking office on January 20, 2025, it is possible that Executive Orders may affect travel or visa processing on or after that date. If you are planning international travel during the winter intersession, we encourage you to:- Review the
[OIS International Student Travel web page](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/academic-resources/international-services/students/current-students/travel/) - Consider returning to the U.S. before January 20, 2025, if you are unsure about visa requirements or travel risks
- Be aware that election transitions can temporarily affect staffing levels at U.S. embassies and consulates abroad, potentially impacting visa processing times.

**4. Uncertainty Is Normal During Transitions**

We understand that uncertainty can be challenging, especially during times of transition. Please know that OIS has experience in navigating changes in federal administration and immigration policies, and will do our best to guide you through any changes as smoothly as possible. Our team is here to support you, and will share updates as soon as we have concrete information. Please DO maintain your current legal and valid non-immigrant status at all times. If you have any doubts or questions about your status, please contact OIS at[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

Lastly, for now, even though our University will close on Tuesday, December 24, and reopen on Thursday, January 2, 2025, our Department of Public Safety (718-817-2222) has a process to contact OIS officials if there is an emergency during that time.

On behalf of the entire OIS team, I wish you all happy holidays and a happy, successful, and rewarding new year.Salvatore Longarino, Director
