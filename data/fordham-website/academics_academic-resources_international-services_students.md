# International Students

The Office for International Services (OIS) glad to welcome dedicated students from around the world to be a part of the Fordham community. We look forward to meeting you and working together to help you achieve your academic and professional goals.

The OIS proudly serves over 2500 international students, scholars, and faculty at our Rose Hill and Lincoln Center campuses.

[Prospective Students](/academics/academic-resources/international-services/students/prospective-students/)

Prospective students must first apply and be admitted to a Fordham program before the Office for International Services (OIS) can issue an I-20 or DS-2019.

Once you have been admitted, you will need to submit the required documentation in order for OIS to create your immigration document. Your I-20 or DS-2019 will be sent to you digitally.

Arriving in the United States is very exciting, but it can also be stressful. Once you have been admitted to a Fordham program, you must complete the steps required to receive your I-20 or DS-2019 before applying for your student visa.

Although the Office for International Services (OIS) supports all non-immigrant students at Fordham, we specialize in assisting students in [F-1 and J-1 status](/academics/academic-resources/international-services/students/current-students/#d.en.191427). Our office provides guidance and resources to help you understand your visa requirements, maintain your status, and make the most of your academic and personal experience at Fordham.

[Post-Graduation](/academics/academic-resources/international-services/students/post-graduation/)

If you continue your stay in the U.S. after graduation with your F-1 visa, there are some very important things to know and regulation you must follow in order to legally stay within the country.
