# Maintaining Your Status

## Maintaining Your Status

As an F-1 or J-1 student, it is your responsibility to maintain your legal immigration status while studying in the United States. The Office for International Services (OIS) is here to help you stay in compliance with federal regulations and University policies.

Below are key areas you must pay attention to throughout your studies at Fordham.

-
## 1. Full-Time Enrollment

To maintain your F-1 or J-1 student status, you must be registered for a full course of study each academic term.

**Undergraduate Students:**Full-time enrollment requires at least 12 credit hours each semester except when you need a lesser course load to complete the course of study during the current term. You MUST see your academic dean and contact an OIS advisor.**Graduate Students**: For immigration purposes, 9 credit hours each semester is considered full-time. If you are taking fewer than 9 credits, you may file a "[Deviation from Full Course of Study Form](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/international-services/pdfs/Deviation-Form.pdf)", signed by your academic advisor and return it to the OIS for approval.

If you have any concerns about your registration or your ability to enroll full-time:

- Undergraduate students should contact their Class Dean.
- Graduate students should contact their Academic Advisor.

If you are unable to enroll full-time, you must obtain authorization for a Reduced Course Load (RCL) from OIS before dropping below full-time status. Failure to do so will result in a violation of your immigration status.

If you are concerned about your registration status and its influence on your immigration (F-1/J-1) status, you should contact the OIS immediately at

[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#147b7d6754727b66707c75793a717061)For details, see the section below on Reduced Course Load.
