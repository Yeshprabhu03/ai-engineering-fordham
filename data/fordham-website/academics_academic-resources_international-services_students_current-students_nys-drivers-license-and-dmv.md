# NYS Driver's License and DMV

-
**New York State Driver’s Licenses, Identification Cards**All of this information is based on living in

[New York](https://dmv.ny.gov/).Living in

[New Jersey](https://www.nj.gov/mvc/)or[Connecticut](https://portal.ct.gov/dmv?language=en_US)require different standards.You must have a valid driver's license to drive a car in the United States. A valid driver's license from another country is also valid in New York State (NYS). You do not need to apply for a NYS license unless you become a resident of NYS. Please see the section on "

[Drivers from Other Nations](https://dmv.ny.gov/driver-license#driversfromothernations)" on the NY DMV website.According to NYS law,

[Section 250 (5) and the Definition of a Resident](https://dmv.ny.gov/driver-license/driving-in-new-york-state), "Students from other states or nations are normally not considered residents of NYS." This means that students do NOT need to get a NYS license in order to drive in NYS. Students who have been in the US for more than 5 years ARE considered residents.However, students should have an International Driving Permit, in addition to their home country license, in order to drive. The International Driving Permit is not a license. The permit only verifies that you hold a valid driver's license in your home country. Your foreign driver's license, NOT the International Driving Permit, allows you to drive in NYS. You can ONLY obtain a Permit in your home country. You are not required to have an International Driving Permit, however it is strongly recommended, as it verifies, in several languages, that you have a valid foreign license. A police officer who cannot read the language on your foreign driver's license can read the Permit.

The OIS recommends that you always carry:

- International driver's license (in English, if possible)
- International Driving Permit
- Copy of the Section 250(5) law that states you are NOT a resident ( print this page).
- The DMV page that states it is legal for non-residents to drive with your non-NY State license ( print pages 6-7 from this document)

If you become a resident of NY State, you must have a NY State driver's license in order to drive.

**Learner's Permits and Driver's Licenses****Identification:**When you go to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) you will need to provide 6 points of Identification in order to apply for a NY Driver's license.**How to Prove 6 Points of Identification**

The following items can be used to accumulate 6 points of identification. Please note: you must show Proof of Date of Birth and if you do not qualify for a Social Security (SSA) number you must still provide the denial letter from SSA to show you do not qualify and include it in your application. The denial letter is not worth any points but it is required.**Required**- Social Security Number (SSN) OR Social Security Denial Letter** = 2 Points

Worth 2 POINTS only if you have SSN. The DMV will ask you for a social security number. Most students in F1/J1 status will not be eligible to apply for a social security number. Please refer to the section on Social Security numbers to see if you qualify.&**

To address the DMV social security number requirement, you can go to the local Social Security Administration office and request a denial letter. The Social Security Administration will issue this letter immediately. You are required to take this denial letter to the DMV and submit it as part of your application for a driver's license.

Alternatively, the DMV now offers an Affidavit Stating No Social Security Number, which you can sign in front of a DMV representative. If you use this affidavit, you do not need to go to Social Security Administration office.

- Proof of Date of Birth = 3 POINTS

This will include your Passport, Visa, I-94, and I-20 (or DS2019). A passport is a good source of identification because it provides proof of age, a photo ID, and a signature. All documents must be originals, no exceptions. - U.S. Health insurance card = 1 POINT
- Utility bill (1 POINT)
- ONE of the following: Bank statement, Cancelled check, US credit card =1 POINT
- US College ID & Official Transcript = 2 POINTS

For new students you should wait one semester in order to have a transcript available.

* The DMV has a very useful tool to help you with getting the right documentation for your application.

**Initial Process**

You may obtain a NY Driver's license from the DMV by passing a written examination, obtaining a learner's permit, and then passing the road test. The written test is available in 25 languages. A driver's manual, used to study for the written exam, is available at the DMV. If you are unable to take a written examination, you have the right to request an oral exam. In addition, you must have your eyes screened for field vision and basic colors. Both tests are given on a walk-in basis at most full-service DMV offices. The addresses of two full service DMV offices are listed at the end of this section. Once you have passed the written test and eye exam, you will be issued a learner's permit. After you receive a learner's permit, you will be able to schedule a road test, which is a requirement for the NY driver's license.**The Road Test**

To take the road test you must supply a car that has a valid NY inspection sticker. The vehicle's registration must be presented as well. Please note that the examiner must be able to reach the vehicle's emergency brake or footbrake.**Sponsor Requirements**

To take the road test, you must be accompanied by a sponsor who is at least 18 years of age, has at least one year of driving experience, and possesses a valid license issued by his/her home state. You do not need a road test sponsor if you are licensed from a country that is listed in the 1949 Road Acts Convention. Upon passing the road test, you may exchange your Learner's Permit for a driver's license. Bring the stamped and signed learner's permit to any DMV full-service office to obtain your driver's license.**International License Conversions**

Everyone must take a full examination - written and driving, including people converting licenses from other countries and many states. Call the DMV for more information.**New York Identification Cards**

It is also possible to obtain an identification card (not valid for driving purposes) from the DMV. You must follow the same process and requirements as obtaining a Driver's License listed above. You will need to present your documents equaling 6 points, complete an application, and pay a fee. This is recognized as a valid form of photo identification. - Social Security Number (SSN) OR Social Security Denial Letter** = 2 Points
