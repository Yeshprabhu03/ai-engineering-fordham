# Travel and Re-entry for International Students

As an international student/scholar you are permitted to travel internationally. Upon arrival, each visitor has to go through inspection by United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP). It is important for an international student/scholar to travel with required documents to ensure a smooth re-entry to the United States. Be sure to keep these items in your carry-on baggage. Do not put them in your checked luggage.

## Required documents for travel and re-entry into the United States

- Valid passport
- Valid visa
- Your visa must valid (not expired) upon re-entry, with a few exceptions (see below)
- You can check your visa status anytime at:
[https://ceac.state.gov/CEACStatTracker/Status.aspx](https://ceac.state.gov/CEACStatTracker/Status.aspx)(for Visa Application Type, select “NONIMMIGRANT VISA (NIV).”

- Valid I-20/DS-2019 and valid travel signature.
- For current students, the travel endorsement on the I-20 must be less than one year old on the date that you are returning to the U.S.
- If you are on OPT/STEM OPT, the travel signature must be less than 6 months old on the date that you are returning to the U.S.
- For J-1 students, the travel signature on the DS-2019 will have a "valid thru" date.
- If you need a travel endorsement, you can obtain a new travel signature by
[submitting an online request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfO_NghHgnS9zhsIZe2s3RpsZfvL781gm6YxodQT1D-kGFpAQ/viewform). Please**only request a travel signature if your current one will be expired at the time of re-entry**, otherwise we may deny your request.

- If you need a travel endorsement, you can obtain a new travel signature by

- EAD card if you are on approved OPT/STEM OPT
- If you are on OPT, you should also bring proof of your employment (if you already have a job) or proof of your job search (if you are unemployed at the time of travel).


Other recommended documents for F-1 and J-1 students wishing to re-enter the US: proof of financial support, Fordham University contact information, proof of your acceptance into Fordham and that you are a continuing Fordham student (such as an acceptance letter and/or your next semester's course schedule), and proof of your I-901 SEVIS fee payment.

## Travel Endorsement Requests

If you need an updated travel endorsement, or an I-20 that reflects updated information about your program and/or work authorization, you may submit a [New I-20/Travel Signature Request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfO_NghHgnS9zhsIZe2s3RpsZfvL781gm6YxodQT1D-kGFpAQ/viewform). Updated I-20s will be sent to your Fordham email. You should print and sign (with ink) the copy we send you.


## I-515A

**If you do not have a valid travel signature** on your I-20, or you packed it away in your suitcase, ask the border officer for an** I-515A form**. This will allow you to enter the country in F-1 status.

However, you must contact OIS immediately to finish processing your entry. Your I-94 card will be stamped "F-1" and a certain date, instead of D/S.


**Travel While OPT is Pending**

- Two possible scenarios:
-
- Before program end date on your I-20: Carry the required documents (see above).
- After the program end date on your I-20: We do not recommend traveling after your program end date and while your OPT application is pending. You need to monitor your mailbox for requests from USCIS.

If you must travel, carry a copy of your receipt notice as proof of OPT application. If you do receive approval while you’re abroad, EAD cards should not be mailed internationally. Rather, ask someone to scan you a copy of your OPT EAD.

- Before program end date on your I-20: Carry the required documents (see above).
- Note: F-1 students
**must be present in the U.S.**when submitting the OPT application with USCIS. If you are interested in participating in OPT and are past your program end date, be sure tobefore departing the U.S.**complete the OPT process**


## Travel while STEM Extension is Pending

- Two possible scenarios:
- Before your current EAD card expires: Carry the required documents (see above).
- After your current EAD card expires: OIS does not recommend traveling during this period. During this period, you should be monitoring your mail for notices from USCIS. If you receive an RFE (Request for Evidence), you will not be able to react by a specific deadline if you’re not present in the U.S.

If you must travel, keep a copy of your receipt notice as proof of STEM OPT application. If you do receive approval while you’re abroad, EAD cards should not be mailed internationally. Rather, ask someone to scan you a copy of your STEM EAD.


## I-94 Record

The I-94 records the date and purpose of your entry into the U.S., and the length of time that you are allowed to stay here. As F-1 and J-1 students, you are allowed to stay in the U.S. for as long as it takes for you to finish your studies. This is called Duration of Status (D/S). If your “Admit Until Date” says anything other than “D/S,” please contact OIS.

You can and should go online to obtain your I-94, and you should print a copy for your records. [ You can obtain your I-94 here](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/#/recent-search).

When entering your information, make sure to enter your name exactly as it appears on your passport. If you are not able to obtain your I-94, try ALL possible combinations of your name.

If you have tried all possible combinations, but cannot obtain your I-94, please contact OIS.


## Contiguous Territories and Adjacent Islands

There are a few countries that you can travel to (for less than 30 days) and return to the US with an expired F-1 or J-1 visa. This process is called "automatic revalidation." These countries are called the adjacent islands and contiguous territories.

HOWEVER, students from some countries are NOT eligible for automatic revalidation. Please refer to this [website](http://www.ice.gov/sevis/travel/faq_f2.htm) to see if you are eligible, and for more travel information.

The contiguous territories are: Canada and Mexico

The adjacent islands are: Saint Pierre, Miquelon, The Dominican Republic, Haiti, Bermuda, The Bahamas, Barbados, Jamaica, The Winward and Leeward Islands, Trinidad, Martinique, and other British, French, and Dutch territories in or bordering on the Caribbean Sea.


## U.S. CBP Discretion and DHS TRIPS

US Customs and Border Patrol agents have a wide degree of discretion when determining the admissibility of any individual into the United States. Even if you carry all the required documentation, an officer may still require you to go through secondary screening, where you may be asked additional questions or subject to search.

If you are subject to repeated difficulties when entering the United States, you can file an inquiry with the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP): [https://www.dhs.gov/dhs-trip](https://www.dhs.gov/dhs-trip)


## Renewing Your Visa

Before you travel outside of the U.S., you should always check if your visa is still valid. If your visa has expired, you need to get a new visa from a U.S. consulate or embassy outside of the U.S. You can’t renew your visa inside the U.S.

If you already hold a valid I-20 from Fordham, you will not be required to get another I-20 to renew your visa.
