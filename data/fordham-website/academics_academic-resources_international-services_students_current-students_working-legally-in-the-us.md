# Working Legally in the U.S.

F-1 international students have several employment options while studying in the United States, but most opportunities require prior authorization. Students **cannot** work without the appropriate approval unless the position is considered volunteer work or on-campus employment.

Employment authorization in the U.S. involves specific eligibility requirements and application steps. The information below provides a brief overview of the most common options available to F-1 students—on-campus employment, curricular practical training (CPT), and optional practical training (OPT). Students with on-campus employment or approved off-campus work authorization are also eligible to apply for a [social security number](/academics/academic-resources/international-services/students/current-students/social-security/).

Each semester, OIS hosts an Employment Authorization Webinar that provides a detailed overview of the employment options available to F-1 students. We encourage students to keep an eye out at the start of each semester for announcements about the next session. Below is the presentation from our most recent webinar.
