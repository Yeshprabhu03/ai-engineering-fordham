## Undergraduate On-Campus Housing

Once you have applied and been accepted to Fordham, student housing may be offered to you by the [Office of Undergraduate Admission](/admissions-and-aid/) after submitting your academic deposits. [Learn more](/student-life/living-on-campus/applying-for-housing/) about applying for housing.

## Graduate On-Campus Housing

Housing on the [Rose Hill Campus](/student-life/living-on-campus/living-on-campus-at-rose-hill/) is available only to undergraduates. However, a limited number of graduate student housing is available in apartments located near the campus.

On-campus housing at [Lincoln Center](/student-life/living-on-campus/living-on-campus-at-lincoln-center/) is available to undergraduates and nearby off-campus housing is available to graduate students in the Fordham School of Law, Graduate School of Business, Graduate School of Social Service (GSSS) and Graduate School of Education (GSE). Arrangements must be made in advance through the Office of [Residential Life](http://legacy.fordham.edu/student_affairs/residential_life/index.asp) at Lincoln Center.

## Off-Campus Housing

Finding housing in New York can be expensive and competitive. Before moving into an apartment, a security deposit equaling one month’s rent is usually required. Most students try to find roommates to share apartments. At the Rose Hill campus, listings are available at the Office of Residential Life. At the Lincoln Center campus, listings are posted on the Bulletin Board outside of Lowenstein Room 408.

### Housing Search

One-to-World prepares a booklet, The International Student’s Survival Guide to Living in New York City, which also provides housing resources. We also issue a White Book which includes some helpful housing information when we issue your I-20.

Remember that you may enter the U.S. starting 30 days prior to the start date on your I-20.

**As soon as you have found a place to live off-campus, you must notify the OIS of your address within 10 days.**
