# Immigration and Visa Information

Welcome to Fordham University! As a newly admitted international student, one of your first steps is to obtain the appropriate immigration documents and apply for your U.S. visa. The information below will help guide you through this process from start to finish.

## Understanding your immigration status

**What does it mean to be a non-immigrant?**

A non-immigrant is someone who seeks temporary entry to the United States for a specific purpose. All non-immigrants require a visa to enter the United States and must maintain their status by pursuing their intended purpose and following certain regulations.

**When do you need an F-1 visa?**

Every visa status reflects a specific purpose. If your primary goal is to **earn a degree**, the most appropriate status is F-1.

There are a few exceptions (for example, H-4 or J-1 status). If you think you might fall into one of these other categories, we encourage you to contact us with any questions you may have.

In order to obtain an F-1 or J-1 visa, you must first receive an immigration document from our office **with the intent to enroll full-time**.

- Form I-20 for F-1 students
- Form DS-2019 for J-1 students

## Key immigration documents

**SEVIS form I-20 (F-1 students)**This is a three-page document issued by Fordham, which describes the nature and expected duration of your program, your financial resources, and other information. It has a SEVIS ID number on it, which lets immigration identify you. Your SEVIS ID is the 9-digit number starting with N, at the top-right of your I-20, located above the bar code. The Form I-20 allows you to apply for an F-1 visa stamp and to gain F-1 (student) status when you enter the US.

Immigration regulations require that you attend the school that issued the I-20 you use to enter the United States. DO NOT use another school’s I-20 to enter the United States if you intend to study at Fordham.

**You can use our I-20 with a valid F-1 Visa that has another school's name on it.****SEVIS form DS-2019 (J-1 students)**This is a two-page document issued by your sponsoring organization, which describes your purpose for entering the United States, the expected duration of your program, and your sources of funding. Form DS-2019 permits you to apply for a J-1 visa stamp and to gain J-1 (Exchange Visitor) status when you enter the United States.

**Visa stamp**A U.S. visa stamp in your passport allows you to enter the United States. You can only apply for a student visa at a U.S. consulate or embassy

*outside*of the United States. Notations on the visa stamp include the type of visa (F-1, J-1, etc.), the number of entries allowed (M=Multiple), and the expiration date**. It is OK if your visa expires while you are in the United States.**The only purpose of the visa is to allow you to enter the country, like a key. So, the only time you must renew your visa is if you will leave the United States and intend to re-enter.**Passport**Your passport must always remain valid while in the United States.


If traveling internationally, ensure it will be valid for**at least six months**beyond your return date. You may renew it through your home country’s consulate in New York.
