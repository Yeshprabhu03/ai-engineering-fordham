# International Student Post-Graduation

Congratulations on graduating from Fordham University! Now that your studies are done, many international students chose to stay in the U.S. to work in their major area of study.

If you continue your stay in the U.S. after graduation with your F-1 visa, there are some very important things to know and regulations you must follow in order to legally stay within the country.

Travel and Re-entry

Students on OPT or STEM OPT should review this page before traveling internationally. It outlines required documents, including an I-20 with a **travel signature issued within the last six months**, and explains how travel may be impacted if your OPT or STEM extension is pending or if your visa has expired.


### Cap Gap extension

F-1 students on post-completion OPT who have a timely-filed H-1B petition may be eligible for a CAP-Gap extension, which allows them to continue working in the U.S. while their H-1B petition is pending. This extension bridges the gap between the end of OPT and the start of H-1B status (typically October 1) so that students can maintain employment authorization without interruption. Eligible students must continue to report employment and address changes to the Office for International Services to remain in compliance.
