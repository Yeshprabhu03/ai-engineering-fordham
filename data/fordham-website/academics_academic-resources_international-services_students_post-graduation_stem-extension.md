## OPT Maintenance of Status Fee

*Updated March 14, 2025**During your studies as an F-1 student at Fordham University, you paid a fee per year for the purposes of maintaining your status, funding programming and providing additional staffing at OIS. Once you complete your studies, such charges stop. However, as you know, if you apply for OPT after graduation you remain under our F-1 sponsorship and continually receive our services. Currently at OIS, we serve more F-1 students receiving OPT benefits than our entire current international undergraduate population.**As a consequence of this increased demand for services, starting February 18, 2020, we introduced a new OPT Maintenance of Status Fee to enhance our staff and services responding to the great expansion of our international population and provide advising to you in a complex and dynamic regulatory environment. As of March 14, 2025, OPT Maintenance of Status Fee rates are:**$131 at the time of application for OPT**$193 at the time of application for STEM extension*

*Thank you for your understanding and support.*

[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#dbb4b2a89bbdb4a9bfb3bab6f5bebfae). -
Along with the New I-20 with STEM Extension recommendation, you will receive detailed instructions for filing Form I-765 online with USCIS.

You must file Form I-765 with USCIS before your current OPT period expires and within 60 days of the date OIS recommended the post-completion OPT in SEVIS.


### After Filing Form I-765 with USCIS

The employment authorization for approved STEM OPT begins on the day after the post-completion OPT expires and ends 24 months later. The approval comes in the form of an Employment Authorization Document from USCIS.


### Working While the STEM OPT Application is Pending

A student who has filed a timely application for the STEM OPT extension with USCIS may continue to work while the application is pending, until a final decision is made on the application by USCIS or it has been pending 180 days with USCIS, whichever comes first. The USCIS receipt notice will serve as proof of employment authorization while your STEM OPT is pending.


### Reporting Requirements on STEM

Please **r****eview the important STEM reporting requirements.**

To maintain F-1 status while on STEM extension, you agree to report to OIS within 10 days any of the following changes:

- Current job's Employer Identification Number (EIN)
- Name of current employer
- Employer's address
- Job title
- Employer end date
- You are ending your current job and want to ADD a new employer
- Current supervisor’s name, address, or phone number

You also agree to validate directly to an OIS Advisor **every 6 months** while on STEM extension the following information: your current employer name/address and/or loss of employment, and your current local U.S address.


### Unemployment Allowance

If you receive STEM OPT approval from USCIS, you are granted an additional 60 days of unemployment. This means the maximum total unemployment is 150 days during a 36-month period (regular OPT + STEM extension). All unemployment during this 36-month window is calculated together and accrues on the unemployment counter. SEVP portal does not show the unemployment counter; please reach out to your DSO to double check. If you are nearing the 150-day maximum, you should take measures to seek employment and protect your F-1 status.
