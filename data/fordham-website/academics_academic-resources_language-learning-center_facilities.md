The Olga M. Ficarra / Francis J. Morison Language Laboratory at Lincoln Center is a multi-use, interactive, computer-based facility with VDI technology. The Lab is designed to accommodate users individually or in groups in an independent and/or monitored atmosphere. The audio/recording assembly allows for traditional listening and dubbing as well as selected repetition with use of our language software. Students access their course materials via a web application called Sansspace, which grants access to our server.
