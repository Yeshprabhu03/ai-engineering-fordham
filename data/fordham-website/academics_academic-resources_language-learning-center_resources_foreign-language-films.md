# Foreign Language Films for Language Students

The Language Learning Center is also a great place to watch foreign language films. Films may either be assigned by your professor to be watched as part of the course or they can be viewed voluntarily for your own entertainment. We are constantly expanding our film viewing library as every semester professors add new films for their students.
