# Air Force Curriculum and Programs

## What is Air Force ROTC?

The Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) is a military leadership program designed to give men and women the opportunity to become Air Force and Space Force officers while completing a degree. The General Military Course (GMC) is taken during your freshman and sophomore years. This program allows you to try out the Air Force for up to two years without incurring any obligation. The Professional Officer Course (POC) is taken during your junior and senior years.

Before you enter the Professional Officer Course, you will attend a two-week summer Field Training course at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. Air Force ROTC classes cover topics such as military customs and courtesies, development of aerospace power, leadership and communication theories, and national defense policy. You will attend weekly Leadership Laboratory (LLAB) training sessions, where you will put into practice the leadership skills and management theories discussed in the classroom.
