# Air Force ROTC Leadership Laboratory

Leadership Laboratory (LLAB) allows students to learn leadership skills through participation in our military training program. LLAB activities include basic military drill and ceremonies, guest speakers, challenging group problem solving activities, and physical fitness training. Active duty officers provide oversight, but the LLAB program is run by the students in the cadet wing. As you progress through the AFROTC program, you will take on increasing levels of responsibility in planning and executing the LLAB program.
