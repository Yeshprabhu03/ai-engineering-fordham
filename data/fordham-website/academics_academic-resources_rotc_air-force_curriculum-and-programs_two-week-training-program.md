# Air Force ROTC Two-Week Training Program

**Will I have to go to boot camp?**

AFROTC cadets participate in a two-week training program during the summer between their sophomore and junior years in AFROTC. This two-week program is called “Field Training” and it is the AFROTC equivalent of boot camp. You will spend your first two years in the AFROTC program learning the skills that you will need in order to be successful at Field Training. Field Training takes place at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama. While you are at Field Training, you will receive career orientation, survival training, weapons familiarization, physical training, and familiarization with the organization and function of an Air Force base.
