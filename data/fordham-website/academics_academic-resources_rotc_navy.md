## Naval Preparatory Program

NROTC Preparatory Scholarships allow interested high school students, who show great potential via grades, character, and extra-curricular activities but might lack standardized test scores or advanced high school courses, to apply for one-year university, or privately funded scholarships. University NROTC Prep programs are designed to provide students the educational foundation necessary for success in the NROTC program and Navy.

Each University has its own unique NROTC preparatory program. All universities provide scholarships for tuition, fees, room and board for the preparatory year. Upon prep year completion, the Navy NROTC scholarship supports tuition, books and fees for up to 40 months of benefits (up to 5 yr total benefit).
