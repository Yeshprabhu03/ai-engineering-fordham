# About Navy ROTC

## Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps

The Navy ROTC Program was established to educate and train qualified young men and women for service as commissioned officers in the unrestricted line communities of the Navy and in the Marine Corps. As the largest single source of Navy and Marine Corps officers, the [Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps](http://www.nrotc.navy.mil/) (NROTC) Scholarship Program fills a vital need in preparing mature young men and women for leadership and management positions in an increasingly technical Navy and Marine Corps.

The Navy ROTC unit in New York City is physically located in the Bronx at SUNY Maritime College, but serves Fordham University students at all the Fordham campuses. Graduates from the Navy and Marine Corps NROTC program at Fordham serve as active duty commissioned officers in the Navy on ships, in submarines, in the aviation field, and in Naval Special Operations (EOD) and Special Warfare (SEALS), and as officers in the Marine Corps.

Current high school students interested in applying for a four-year Navy or Marine Corps scholarship, please go to [Naval Reserve Officers Training Corp](http://www.nrotc.navy.mil/) website for more information about the National Scholarship Application process and begin your application.
