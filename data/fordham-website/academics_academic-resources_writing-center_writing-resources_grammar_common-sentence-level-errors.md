# Common Sentence Level Errors

Great sentences make great paragraphs, so as you finalize a paper, reviewing it at the sentence level is a good idea. Use these tips to avoid problems that can be particularly challenging for writers whose first language is not English.


**Subject-Verb Agreement**

Check that the subjects and verbs in all sentences agree: do singular subjects have singular verbs, and plural subjects have plural verbs? Agreement can be tricky for English Language Learners, since adding -s makes most nouns plural, while adding -s in the third person singular makes most verbs singular. Notice, for example:

*Singular subject: * The curriculum engage**s** students in exploring different religions.

*Plural subject:* These books engag**e** a diversity of readers.

When reviewing intricate sentences, it’s helpful to determine whether the subject is singular or plural and then double-check the verb accordingly. Remember, it’s always the ** subject-verb **agreement that counts. Avoid attempting to make the verb agree with other nouns in a sentence, such as an

**in a prepositional phrase, as in this example:**

*object**A central part of my life goals *~~have~~*has** been to go to law school. *


**Run-On Sentences**

Academic writing invites us to fuse complex ideas, so it’s easy to lose sight of the punctuation and conjunctions required to avoid run-on sentences. Notice the “comma splice” error in this example:

*Paul Klee’s paintings seem simple, they are very sophisticated.*

One solid way to join these two independent clauses (and avoid a comma splice) is to add a conjunction after the comma, like this:

*Paul Klee’s paintings seem simple**, but **they are very sophisticated. *

Another solution is to use a subordinating conjunction, like this:

*Although** Paul Klee’s paintings seem simple, they are very sophisticated. *

**Fragments**

Incomplete sentences, known as fragments, occur when a subject or verb is missing. Frequently, fragments occur because a dependent clause has not been correctly attached to an independent clause. Here are three examples of fragments and corrections:


*Marie Antoinette spent vast sums of money on her favorites. Helped to bring on the French Revolution.*

Marie Antoinette spent vast sums of money on her favorites. **Her extravagance** **helped** to bring on the French Revolution. (lacking subject)


*The old aluminum boat sitting on its trailer.*

The old aluminum boat **was** sitting on its trailer. (lacking complete verb).


*We returned to the main office. Where we waited for the rest of the staff to arrive.*

We returned to the main office**, where **we waited for the rest of the staff to arrive. (beginning with a subordinate word)

Problems with parallel structure, pronouns, prepositions, and the use of colons and semi-colons may also be at the roots of flawed sentences. For help, consult these *Writing Center Resources.*
