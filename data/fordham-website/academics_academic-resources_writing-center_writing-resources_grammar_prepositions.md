# Prepositions

When writing, it’s important to keep moving–and bring the reader along. Two aspects of writing that often present challenges are transitioning between ideas and introducing evidence. Too little explanation leaves the reader lost; too many words (aka “beating around the bush”), leave the reader impatient.

Prepositions, used in conjunction with verbs, nouns and adjectives, can provide a succinct way to navigate transitions *and *introduce evidence. Below are some examples to keep handy. For success applying these ideas, try to diversify the prepositions used throughout an essay. Remember: repetition (even of prepositions) disrupts flow–variety enriches it.
