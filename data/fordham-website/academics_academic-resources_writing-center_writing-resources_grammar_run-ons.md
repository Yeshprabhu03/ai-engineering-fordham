# Run-ons

Run-ons are two or more independent clauses joined incorrectly either with a comma or without punctuation.

There are two kinds of run-ons:

1. **Fused Sentences** join two or more independent clauses incorrectly without any punctuation or a conjunction.

*There was a lot of ice on the road I slipped.*

This fused sentence joins two independent clauses incorrectly without any punctuation. Each of these independent clauses can stand alone (“There was a lot of ice on the road” and “I slipped”).

2. **Comma Splices** join two or more independent clauses incorrectly by adding a comma.

*The school is empty, there must be a snow day.*This sentence joins two independent clauses incorrectly with a comma. Each of these independent clauses can stand alone (“the school is empty” and “there must be a snow day”).

*There was a lot of snow, however the school stayed open.*

This sentence joins two independent clauses incorrectly with a comma and a conjunctive adverb. Conjunctive adverbs (however, nevertheless, moreover, etc.) should be preceded by a period or semi-colon and followed by a comma when used to join sentences. Each of these independent clauses can stand alone (“there was a lot of snow” and “the school stayed open”).

**How to Revise Run-ons **

Problem Sentence: There were five inches of snow, the trains stopped running.

**1. Use a Comma and Coordinating Conjunction**

Add a comma and a coordinating conjunction (and, but, or, nor, for, so, yet). Remember: the comma must precede the coordinating conjunction. There were five inches of snow, and the trains stopped running.

**2. Create Separate Sentences**

Separate independent clauses into two or more sentences by adding a period.

*There were five inches of snow. The trains stopped running.*

**3. Use a Semicolon**Add a semicolon to separate two independent clauses. This is a good approach if there is a direct relationship between the two sentences. You might add a conjunctive adverb (however, nevertheless, moreover, etc.) after the semicolon to clarify the relationship between the sentences.

*There were five inches of snow; consequently, the trains stopped running.*

**4. Use a Colon**

Use a colon to fix a run-on if the first independent clause introduces the second or if the second gives a reason for the first.

*The trains stopped running: there were five inches of snow. *

**5. Restructure**Restructure sentences into combined subordinate and independent clauses. (A subordinate clause begins with a subordinating conjunction, such as after, although, because, since, while, etc.)

*Since there were five inches of snow, the trains stopped running.*

**Revision Checklist**

Identify:

o Underline the main verb(s) in the sentence. Is there more than one main verb?

o Underline the subject for each main verb in the sentence. Is there a subject for each main verb?

o If there is a subject for each main verb, ask yourself, how are these parts joined? If there is proper punctuation, you have a compound or complex sentence. If there is no punctuation, or incorrect punctuation (like a comma splice), you have a run-on.

Fix:

o If you are joining two independent clauses with a coordinating conjunction, ask yourself, did I insert a comma before the conjunction?

o If you are separating a run-on into two sentences by inserting a period, ask yourself, can both of these clauses stand alone? o If you are joining two independent clauses with a semicolon or colon, ask yourself, is there a direct relationship between the two clauses? Do I need a conjunctive adverb to help clarify the relationship?

o If you are restructuring the sentence by creating an independent and subordinate clause, ask yourself, did I introduce the subordinate clause with a subordinating conjunction?
