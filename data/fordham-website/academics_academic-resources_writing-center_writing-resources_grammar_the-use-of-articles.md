# The Use of Articles

When English is not your first language, the appropriate use of articles can be especially challenging. As ESOL expert Keith S. Folse reminds us, articles are among the most frequently used words in the English language: typically, ** a**,

**or**

*an***occur once in every 12 words. It’s no wonder, then, that errors made related to article use add up and have a noticeable impact on the flow and clarity of an otherwise strong paper. Here is a quick refresher on the use of articles to keep handy when reviewing your writing.**

*the*

**The Indefinite Articles: ***A*** and ***An*

The best way to ensure you are using these articles accurately is to examine the associated nouns. The articles, ** a** and

**, are used when**

*an***are singular, not specific and making their first appearance.**

*count nouns***or**

*A***are also used to convey affiliation with a group (I am a student. She is a Buddhist.) If you are unsure about the type of noun, take a minute and look it up in a dictionary, like**

*an*[Here are some examples of the appropriate use of](https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary)

*Longman*.**and**

*a*

*an:*

*An argument in favor of…**A noteworthy argument in favor of…**A university may decide….**An umbrella policy…**A policy…**Inspired by a new idea…**An inspiring new idea…*


Notice: When the noun (or adjective + noun) starts with a *consonant sound*, choose ** a; **when the noun (or adjective + noun) starts with a

*vowel sound,*choose


*an***.**


**The Definite Article: ***The*

Use ** the **when specificity is required or to identify “which” person, place or thing is being referenced. For example, use

**when describing the parts of something, including most geographic areas. Also use**

*the***with superlative adjectives, the names of countries that imply plurality and with most bodies of water. Unlike the articles**

*the***and**

*a***,**

*an***can be used with singular, plural, count, and noncount nouns. Here are a few examples of the appropriate use of**

*the*

*the:*

*All colleges have entry requirements. The requirements at this college include…**The Dominican Republic and the Philippines are both known for….France is known for…**All of the Great Lakes are known for…but Lake Michigan is distinctive because…*



**The Zero or Null Article**

Overuse of “the” is another type of error to check for in your writing. In English, nouns are occasionally used without any article, although many other languages would use an equivalent of “the” in these instances. Typically in English, no article is used when referring to a general category or an abstract idea or feeling. The names of languages, nationalities, academic subjects, and sports do not take an article either. Here are a few examples that illustrate the use of the null article.


*Abstract painting emerged as a trend in…..**The abstract painting we examined during class….*


*History is a fascinating and broad field.**The history of trickle down economic policies in the United States has resulted in….*


*Education is a privilege.**The education of girls around the globe remains*…


*Language is fascinating!**The first languages of students at Fordham include Chinese, Hindi, Russian, Spanish, and Vietnamese.*
