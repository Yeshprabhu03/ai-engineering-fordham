# Introductions

- Embody the challenge of deciding when and how to begin a paper;
- Set up and establish the entire purpose of your paper;
- Communicate the subject matter and the main topic of your paper;
- Introduce your thesis statement;
- Set the tone for your style and unique voice as a writer;
- Should be
**concise, engaging, and specific**.

**Parts of an introduction**

Think of the introduction as a map that you are laying out to guide the reader from your general setup to your specific, tailored thesis statement.

- The beginning part:
- Capture your readers’ interest
- an intriguing example
- a provocative quotation that is closely related to your argument
- a puzzling scenario
- a vivid and perhaps unexpected anecdote
- a thought-provoking question
- Contextualize the background and give the reader a general overview of the topic
- State the problem or issue
- Introduce the ongoing scholarly discussions or debates and identify gaps or missing points
- The middle portion:
- Illustrate the specific subject matter within the topic you have chosen that you plan to explore
- Explain how you will engage with the discussions/debates
- The last part:
- Highlight your own contribution to the discussions/debate
- Conclude with your clear, concise, and specific thesis statement
- Offer a road map for the rest of your paper (optional)

**Choosing Your Style of Introduction **

There are many ways to structure an introduction that will depend on what type of paper you are writing and what style best embodies your narrative voice.

*Here are just a few examples: *

- Pose a challenging question that prompts the reader to think. An inquiry, which you will then try to answer in your paper.
- A gripping story that opens a window into the world you are taking the reader to and hooks them in.
- Begin with a powerful or provocative quotation that draws the reader in and takes them directly to the narrative you are setting up. This can be a quote from a powerful figure that connects to your subject matter or one that was captured during a significant event that connects to your paper.

**Five Kinds of Less Effective Introductions**

**The placeholder introduction**: a weaker introduction like this one has multiple ambiguous, meaningless sentences.**The restated question introduction**: Reiterating the question can occasionally be a successful tactic but try not to do so without providing a more detailed, engaging opening to your article.**The Webster’s Dictionary introduction**: This introduction starts off by defining one or more of the words, but such an introduction can be vague and irrelevant to your main thesis. It might be far more fascinating for you (and your reader) to begin with a discussion of a key term if you create your own definition of the term in the context of your course and assignment. Maybe a reading from a source quotation would be preferable. The fact that dictionary introductions are so overused makes them worthless as well.**The “dawn of man” introduction**: This kind of introduction generally makes broad, sweeping statements about the relevance of this topic since the beginning of time, throughout the world, etc. Such introductions can be overly vague and make no reference to the thesis. They might use clichés such as “the dawn of man” and “throughout human history.”**The book report introduction**: This kind of introduction just repeats the name and author of a book you are writing about without stating your main argument clearly. It is descriptive rather than argumentative. Such introductions are ineffective because they offer details that your reader probably already knows, and those introductions are often irrelevant to the thesis.

**Introductions in Relation to Conclusions**

Introductions and conclusions serve as bridges that take the reader into your essay and out of it, respectively. The first paragraph is leading readers into the story you are telling and the argument you are building while the final paragraph performs the function of taking them out of it, but ensuring all you have communicated has made an impact.

**Introductions in the Revision Process**

Try to write or rewrite your introduction last in the revision process. You may find that you don’t know precisely what you are going to argue at the beginning of the writing process.

The revision process is an opportunity for you to reread what you’ve written and ensure it is clear and concise and to see if you have effectively explored your argument. During the process, it is helpful to revisit your introduction in relation to your entire essay and determine if it properly connects to the rest of your piece. You will need to revise your paper to make sure that the introduction, all of the evidence, and the conclusion reflect the argument you intend.

**Examples of Introductions:**** **

**Example 1:**

Here is an example of a narrative essay introduction from the personal narrative essay “Se Habla Español” by Tanya Maria Barrientos.

The man on the other end of the phone line is telling me the classes I’ve called about are first-rate: native speakers in charge, no more than six students per group. I tell him that will be fine and yes, I’ve studied a bit of Spanish in the past. He asks for my name and I supply it, rolling the double “r” in “Barrientos” like a pro. That’s when I hear the silent snag, the momentary hesitation I’ve come to expect at this part of the exchange. Should I go into it again? Should I explain, the way I have to half a dozen others, that [I am Guatemalan by birth but pura gringa by circumstance?](https://genius.com/23816787/Tanya-maria-barrientos-se-habla-espanol/I-am-guatemalan-by-birth-but-pura-gringa-by-circumstance)


In Example 1, the writer

- pulls the reader in with a specific example from her own life;
- runs through her internal conflict and conveys a great deal to the reader about her will to learn Spanish despite what a hurdle it has been;
- helps the reader have a general idea of what the piece is going to be about.


**Example 2: **

Here is an introduction to an argumentative essay.

The 2019 college admissions scandal, known as Operation Varsity Blues, exposed a group of wealthy parents who had paid millions to secure their children a place at some of America’s most elite universities. The case is now infamous for being the largest college admissions fraud in American history. The involvement of Hollywood stars, top entrepreneurs, and media personalities with massive followings is what led the story to become a pop culture phenomenon. But there is a larger lesson to be learned from this scandal that goes beyond the headlines. The discriminatory practices of college admissions boards have made being accepted by a quality university nearly impossible for high school students without ample resources at their disposal. The high price of gaining entry into a quality college can be the difference between having opportunities that lay the path to a brighter future or being left at the bottom of the social hierarchy.


In Example 2, the writer

- starts with a recent news event to give the reader an overview of what the paper is about;
- explores the case through simple yet informative details by providing the reader with a general overview and essential context;
- presents a thesis statement that offers a commentary on the college admissions bribery scandal in relation to a greater issue within the U.S. education system today.

**Example 3**

Here is an example of a research paper from *The Bedford Handbook*.

Should the government enact laws to regulate healthy eating choices? Many Americans would answer an emphatic “No,” arguing that what and how much we eat should be left to individual choice rather than unreasonable laws. Others might argue that it would be unreasonable for the government not to enact legislation, given the rise of chronic diseases that result from harmful diets. In this debate, both the definition of reasonable regulations and the role of government to legislate food choices are at stake. In the name of public health and safety, state governments have the responsibility to shape health policies and to regulate healthy eating choices, especially since doing so offers a potentially large social benefit for a relatively small cost.

In Example 3, the writer

- starts with an engaging question;
- highlights the research conversation and the ongoing debate (They Say);
- provides a thesis statement that answers the question and presents the main point (I Say);
