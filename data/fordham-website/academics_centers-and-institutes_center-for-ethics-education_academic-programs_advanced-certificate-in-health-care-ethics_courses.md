# Advanced Certificate in Health Care Ethics Courses

The Certificate program’s requirements consists of four courses: three discipline-based courses and one capstone course. At least one of the discipline-based courses must be from a humanities discipline, and at least one must be from a social sciences discipline; the third discipline-based course may be from either a humanities or a social sciences discipline. The fourth required course is an cross-disciplinary, team-taught capstone course.

Participating students complete their four-course sequence from a list of approved courses. Students should explore the full range of multi-disciplinary topics available within the list of approved courses, including those offered through the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the Graduate School of Social Service, Master's in Humanities and Sciences, and the School of Law.
