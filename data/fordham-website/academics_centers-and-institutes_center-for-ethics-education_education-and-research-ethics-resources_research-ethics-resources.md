# Research Ethics Resources

The Center for Ethics Education has a number of resources for researchers, students, faculty and teachers, as well as the general public, including:

### Research Ethics Regulations and Guidelines

View our [Research Ethics Regulations and Guidelines](/academics/centers-and-institutes/center-for-ethics-education/hiv-and-drug-abuse-prevention-research-ethics-training-institute/resources/research-ethics-regulations-and-guidelines/) page for National and International guidelines for protecting participants in HIV prevention research.

### Resources for Ethics Education

The Fordham Ethics Center has convened several multidisciplinary meetings with faculty, administrators and students to develop recommendations and resources for teaching. We have also made available lectures from faculty teaching at our [HIV and Drug Abuse Prevention Research Ethics Training Institute](/academics/centers-and-institutes/center-for-ethics-education/hiv-and-drug-abuse-prevention-research-ethics-training-institute/) to inform teaching and ethics education programs.

### Research Ethics Scales and Measures

The Fordham Ethics Center, in partnership with the HIV Prevention Research Ethics Training Institute provides continuously-updated [evidence-based research ethics resources](http://www.researchethicsmeasures.org/) for investigators who wish to use scales and measures to study all aspects of research ethics, not limited to HIV prevention.
