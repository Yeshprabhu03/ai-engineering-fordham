Existing federal research regulations and ethical standards often fall short when investigators apply them to the study of vulnerable populations and marginalized communities. One such population is illicit drug users who are living with or at high risk of acquiring HIV/AIDS. In response to this serious ethical concern, the aim of this National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)-funded research project (R01 DA015649) is to give individuals who use drugs and who are positive or at high risk for HIV/AIDS a voice (through focus groups, individual interviews, and surveys) in how drug and HIV/AIDS research is conducted within their communities. This research project (co-directed by Dr. Celia Fisher, Fordham University, and Dr. Merrill Singer, University of Connecticut) was conducted in collaboration with Housing Works, a New York City-based social service and advocacy group serving homeless individuals who are living with or at high risk for HIV/AIDS. The vignettes included in this resource may be used to prompt discussion among communities on HIV/AIDS and drug abuse research.[Research Ethics Scales and Measures](https://www.researchethics.net/scales-measures)
