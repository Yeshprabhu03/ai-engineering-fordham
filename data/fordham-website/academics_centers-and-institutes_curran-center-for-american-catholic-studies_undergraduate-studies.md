# American Catholic Studies Concentration

The American Catholic Studies Concentration is designed to give students a deeper appreciation of the historical, theological, and cultural manifestations of Catholicism, sharpen critical thinking, and encourage students to contribute actively to their communities.

The Program entails a six-course interdisciplinary concentration focused on the study of Roman Catholic belief and culture in the United States, leading to a certificate at graduation.
