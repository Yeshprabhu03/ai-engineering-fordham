# Cybersecurity Awareness

Today, the Fordham Center for Cybersecurity reaffirms its tenacious dedication to advancing cybersecurity education by marking its participation in the 20th Cybersecurity Awareness Month. Established in 2004, this global October initiative stands as the pinnacle of efforts to champion cybersecurity consciousness and the adoption of best practices. The significance of Cybersecurity Awareness Month lies in its collaborative spirit, uniting businesses, governmental bodies, academic institutions, associations, nonprofits, tribal communities, and individuals with a shared vision: cultivating a culture of online safety.

Technology is deeply intertwined with our lives, from mobile to connected home devices. And while the evolution of technology accelerates, cybercriminals are working just as hard to find ways to compromise technology and disrupt personal and business lives. Cybersecurity Awareness Month aims to highlight some of the emerging challenges in the cybersecurity world today and provide straightforward, actionable guidance that anyone can follow to create a safe and secure digital world for themselves and their loved ones.

This year introduces a resonant theme for Cybersecurity Awareness Month: "Secure Our World." Central to this theme are four pivotal cybersecurity imperatives:

- Understanding the benefits of using a password manager and dispelling existing myths around password manager security and ease of use.
- Turning on multifactor authentication on personal devices and business networks.
- Recognizing and reporting phishing – still one of the primary threat actions used by cybercriminals today.
- Installing updates on a regular basis and turning on automated updates.

Cybersecurity Awareness Month continues to build momentum and impact to provide everyone with the information they need to stay safer and more secure online. Fordham’s Center for Cybersecurity is proud to support this far-reaching online safety awareness and education initiative, which is co-managed by the[ Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency](https://www.dhs.gov/CISA) and the[ National Cybersecurity Alliance.](https://staysafeonline.org/)

This year's offering from the Fordham Center for Cybersecurity includes curated events designed to bolster cybersecurity practices within our Fordham community and to enrich the knowledge base of our cybersecurity program enrollees. In October, we will host four distinct events, each echoing the abovementioned essential themes. These sessions will serve as networking opportunities for those aspiring to venture into cybersecurity careers, interactive workshops, and insights from a distinguished guest speaker—all unified by the overarching objective of intensifying cybersecurity consciousness and celebrating the domain's vast expanse.
