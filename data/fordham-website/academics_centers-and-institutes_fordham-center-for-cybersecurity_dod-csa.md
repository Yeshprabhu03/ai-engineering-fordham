# DoD CSA

The [DoD Cyber Service Academy (DoD CSA)](https://www.dodemergingtech.com/dod-programs/cyber-service-academy-csa/) promotes the education, recruitment, and retention of students in cybersecurity studies. The DoD CSA sponsors students who currently are not DoD or government employees who are enrolled in or applying to universities designated as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity (NCAE-C), such as Fordham University. Following graduation, students are eligible for full-time employment with various components and agencies across the DoD. Students must work for the DoD for at least one year for each year of scholarship support they receive.
