GenCyber is a national initiative supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Security Agency (NSA). This program has the following objectives:

- Encourage interest and diversity in cybersecurity postsecondary education and workforce opportunities
- Improve teaching methods for delivering cybersecurity education
- Strengthen security knowledge and practices among the next generation of cybersecurity professionals
- Offer a tailored, immersive learning experience for young students interested in the cybersecurity field

As the risk of cyberattacks and device vulnerability continues to increase, while the skills gap in the cybersecurity industry remains, it is important now more than ever to promote cybersecurity knowledge, interest, and talent in this field amongst our student generations.

The use of interconnected devices for communication, interaction, work, and education will continue to grow, as will risk; it is critical for students to stay steps ahead of the technological risks and to foster the skills that will be inevitably crucial in their future.

At no cost to participants, the Fordham GenCyber camp will be a five-day virtual camp in summer 2021. Fordham’s 2021 GenCyber camp will be held virtually, due to COVID-19, from June 28-July 2nd. Instruction will be delivered by a team of professors, instructors, and guest speakers of varied backgrounds who have established expertise in cybersecurity teaching and research. The camp will provide engaging instruction, collaborative group activities, hands-on laboratory experiences, and informal instruction to both individuals and groups of participants. Upon completion of the camp, participants will have a strong understanding of cybersecurity essentials, in addition to mastering basic skills that will enable them to be aware of the best mobile security practices as well as general online safety. With direct mentoring and access to cybersecurity graduate students and professionals, students will additionally learn about cybersecurity pathways in both industry and formal education, and how to pursue a future in this field.
