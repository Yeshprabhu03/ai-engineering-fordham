# NSF SFS

Fordham’s Center for Cybersecurity has received a [$4.1 million grant](https://news.fordham.edu/politics-and-society/center-for-cybersecurity-receives-4-1-million-grant-for-scholarships/) - the largest grant in the Center’s history - from the National Science Foundation (NSF) that will enable the University to provide full scholarships to undergraduate and graduate students who wish to earn a degree in cybersecurity.

The [Scholarship for Service (SFS) Program](https://niccs.cisa.gov/formal-education/cybercorps-scholarship-service-sfs) is designed to recruit and train the next generation of cybersecurity professionals to meet the needs of Federal, State, local, and tribal governments. This program provides cybersecurity undergraduate and graduate education scholarships, funded through grants awarded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). In return for the financial support, recipients must agree to work for the U.S. Government in a cybersecurity-related position after graduation for a period equal to the length of the scholarship.

### Benefits:

- Full tuition and academic fees (100%)
- A generous yearly stipend for living expenses ($37,000 for graduate students and $27,000 for undergraduate students).
- A professional allowance of up to $6,000 per year (for books, traveling to the SFS job fair, and other conferences).
- This scholarship may be provided to students for up to three (3) consecutive years.
- The title of an SFS Scholar. SFS Scholars are highly sought-after graduates in the government sector.

### How to Apply:

- While this program has a rolling application deadline, students are welcome to apply by March 15 for full consideration.
- Please reach out to the Fordham SFS program if you are interested in this opportunity and to learn about upcoming information sessions.
- Students applying to the DoD Cyber Service Academy (DoD CSA) will automatically be considered for SFS.
- SFS is a highly competitive program. We receive many more applications than we have spots available. Being admitted to the Master’s in Cybersecurity program at Fordham or applying to the DoD Cyber Service Academy (DoD CSA) does not guarantee acceptance to SFS.
- Once applications for SFS are submitted, the SFS admissions team will contact shortlisted applicants for further consideration.
