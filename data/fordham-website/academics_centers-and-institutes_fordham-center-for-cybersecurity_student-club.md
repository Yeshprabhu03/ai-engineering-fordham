### Student Activities

On September 30th, the Fordham ISACA Cybersecurity Club hosted a Capture the Flag (CTF) Basics Workshop for students of all levels interested in cybersecurity to improve their skills. Students could see walkthroughs of example CTF problems and ask questions about them in an informal setting. Topics covered included Open Source Intelligence, Cryptography, Password Cracking, Log Analysis, Scanning, Enumeration & Exploitation, Network Traffic Analysis, Forensics, Web Application Security, and Malware Analysis. This event promoted collaboration among students, who were also able to network with each other and discuss the presentation topics.
