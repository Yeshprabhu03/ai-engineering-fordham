# IDHA 58 news release by Domino Foundation

**Humans Responding To Humans in Need**

From being a first responder on the frontline in crisis situations in her native KZN to being

part of international teams bringing aid to areas in Mozambique and Turkey devastated by

Mother Nature’s convulsions, reaching out to people in distress is in her veins. In May, Cathy

Whittle, leader of The Domino Foundation’s Disaster Response Unit, found herself in

unfamiliar territory in the hallowed halls of academia as part of the presenting team on a

course on humanitarian assistance at the University of Pretoria.

Pretoria, South Africa, was chosen as one of several venues in 2024 for Fordham University’s

Institute of International Humanitarian Affairs’ in-residence course for the International

Diploma in Humanitarian Assistance. Professionals with in-demand skills wanting to engage

in the field in effective and sustainable ways were led through sessions on refugee issues,

humanitarian negotiation and response planning, among a wide range of other relevant topics.

In three of the sessions, Cathy spoke to the 20 students and staff from countries as far flung

as British Guayana, Zambia, Equador and Australia, about her interactions with donors,

monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the aid and physical help given in emergency

situations and the complexity of the logistics it all entails. “I went from being very

intimidated by the whole prospect of addressing the students and the calibre of the other

speakers to times of wonderfully stimulating interactions in the lecture hall and afterwards

over a cup of coffee.” One of the speakers addressing participants via Zoom, Sir Charles

Petrie, former UN assistant secretary general, has had years of involvement in the

humanitarian landscape Myanmar. Another was Yemen-based Martine van der Does,

working for the Dutch government. She spoke on the current Red Sea crisis, and on local

food and water insecurity.

In her one session, Cathy led a case discussion focusing on her personal involvement with

Domino’s Disaster Response team: “Every journey has a begining, The Domino Disaster

Response story began in 2017 with 3 guys, 2 pick-up trucks and a chainsaw when tropical

cyclone Dineo hit Inhambane, Mozambique with 200 mm (7.9 in) of rain, destroying 20,000

homes and affecting approximately 130,000 people. And, seven years later, here we are still

on the journey!”

With many years of experience in the humanitarian health sector, IDHA Course Director,

Mark Little, led the Pretoria iteration of the course. “Our time in South Africa has been very

stimulating and provided the students great insight into the humanitarian challenges faced

here. Cathy’s presentations gave us a real hands-on understanding of how she and other

South Africans involved in the sector navigate the complexities.” Will he and his colleagues

be running future course here? “IDHA hopes to run a course every year in Sub-Saharan

Africa and South East Asia. The University of Pretoria is a perfect venue and, with the

excellent contacts we have made here, we have a good foundation for working together in the

future.”

Cathy had the final word: “Usually it’s the teacher who aims to challenge and change her

pupils. I came away changed in so many ways, my horizons broadened about humanitarian

response around the world. She added that much of what she experienced was about building

relationships. “As a local actor, I was able to present how we did things and our experience

versus what they study academically. What is in the textbooks is very different to what

happens with local solutions applied in a local context. They were very struck by how

relationally we operate here.”
