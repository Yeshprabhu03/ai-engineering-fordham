The Institute of International Humanitarian Affairs (IIHA) hires Martine Van Der Does, recent Netherlands Humanitarian Diplomat, as the new Helen Hamlyn Humanitarian Fellow.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

2546 Belmont Ave, Bronx, NY, 10458

Rose Hill campus

Monday, July 22, 2024

Bronx, NY - The Helen Hamlyn Humanitarian Fellowship role has been filled by Martine Van Der Does, who joins the IIHA at Fordham University from her role as the Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Netherlands Government in Amman, Jordan. Before this, she worked in various positions in the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs in The Hague and Afghanistan and as an International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) Humanitarian Aid Worker and, prior, a Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) Construction Logistician. While Martine's resume clearly exhibits her humanitarian expertise, her Fordham University record is what ultimately landed her what she calls a “dream job”.

This spring, Brendan Cahill, IIHA Executive Director, quickly realized the perfect candidate was already a part of the Institute of International Humanitarian Affairs (IIHA) at Fordham University as a Master's in International Humanitarian Action (MIHA) alumna and International Diploma in Humanitarian Assistance (IDHA) alumna, course director, and lecturer since 2017.

Martine will oversee the IIHA’s short training programs and senior-level training programs; in addition, will mentor students and alums, assist with strategic planning, work closely with the IIHA senior team and Helen Hamlyn Trust family, and advocate for Fordham University’s IIHA training programs globally at humanitarian events, through writing, and in dialogue with diplomats. One reason Martine will be able to advocate for the IIHA’s humanitarian training programs, such as the IDHA, is because she completed the course herself in 2008:

“I strongly believe in the IDHA through Fordham University as it changed my life and provided a solid basis for my humanitarian work. I wish other people the same memorable experience. One benefit is the people you meet on the course. They’re all humanitarians at heart and you will come across them in the work you perform in the humanitarian field. It provides you a network. In my past experiences, I’ve had to talk to authorities and advocate for humanitarian aid from a government perspective. Now that I am in this exciting new role, I look forward to teaching and meeting people, increasing accessibility for local aid workers, and making the program more financially sustainable, for example, with scholarships.”

“Building local capacity is essential in a context where the number of crises is on the rise and funding is reduced.” - Martine Van der Does

Ruth Mukwana, who serves as the Helen Hamlyn Senior Fellow on the senior team is excited and is looking forward to working with Martine to “expand our partnerships and networks with humanitarian organizations and to improve our students' learning experiences so they can have a positive impact in their chosen career paths."

Together we “ *will improve our [Fordham’s] students' learning experiences so they can have a positive impact in their chosen career paths."* Ruth Mukwana, on her excitement working with Martine

Looking ahead, Martine thinks about today’s humanitarian challenges and how these challenges will fit into her new role:

“There are many challenges in today’s humanitarian work, such as ensuring the humanitarian imperative and principles remain protected and at the core of the humanitarian response as well as enhancing local response. Building local capacity is essential in a context where the number of crises is on the rise and funding is reduced. The IDHA has proven to be effective in building this local capacity. A big part of my position will be to find and foster that need and willingness to participate in educational programs amongst potential partner organizations.”
