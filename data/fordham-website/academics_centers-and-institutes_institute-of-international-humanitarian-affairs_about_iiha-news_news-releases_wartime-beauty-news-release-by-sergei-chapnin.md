The Orthodox Christian Studies Center at Fordham University (OCSC) has unveiled a milestone exhibition, *Wartime Beauty*, marking a historic moment for contemporary Christian art from Ukraine. Curated by Sergei Chapnin, the exhibition presents recent works by Ukrainian iconographers Sofia Atlantova and Oleksandr Klymenko, highlighting unique blend of traditional iconography in a modern context.

This exhibition is a collaboration between The Refuge Gallery and C-Icon Art Gallery and signifies a shared commitment to exploring contemporary interpretations of Christian art and supporting the Ukrainian people in their quest for freedom and independence. At the heart of the exhibition is *Mariupol Deisis* (2022), a striking series of 11 icons from Atlantova and Klymenko’s *Icons on Ammo Boxes* project. Chapnin explains, “Their work departs from certain Byzantine iconographic conventions, not as a rejection, but as a bold reimagining of Eastern Orthodox tradition, reminding us of the enduring desire for beauty that resonates with prayer.” The artists encourage viewers to look beyond the rough, unrefined wood of the ammo boxes, signaling that the spiritual authenticity of their work emerges through each viewer’s perception.

Since its inception amid Ukraine’s struggle in 2014, *Icons on Ammo Boxes* has reshaped how sacred art addresses themes of suffering and resilience. In a time of conflict, holy icons—traditional symbols of holiness and the communion of saints in the Orthodox Christian tradition—reflect the fractures of war yet continue to declare the abiding presence of God, His Holy Mother, and the Saints alongside human anguish.

Running from November 12, 2023, to January 25, 2025, at The Refuge Gallery, this exhibition not only celebrates the collaboration between OCSC and The Refuge Gallery but also sets a foundation for future explorations of Christian art in a changing world.

Guided tours are available upon request.

Sergei Chapnin noted, “It was a true blessing to bring these icons from Ukraine, and we hope the exhibition will inspire Fordham’s faculty, students, and guests, as well as audiences in other U.S. cities and universities.”
