Sir Charles Petrie Bt, OBE has had close to 30 years’ experience working in contexts of

conflict and famine, some of it with Médecins Sans Frontières (Mali and areas under the


control of the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front) and much of it with the UN system

(Sudan, Somalia, Rwanda (during the 1994 Genocide), the Middle East, Democratic

Republic of the Congo, and Afghanistan). From mid 2003 to end 2007 he was the UN

Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, UNDP Resident Representative for Myanmar.

After being asked to leave Myanmar for supporting the monks of the Saffron Revolution,

he became the UN Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary General for Somalia.

A position he held until early 2010. Charles Petrie resigned from the UN at the end of

2010 at the level of Assistant Secretary General as the Executive Representative of the

Secretary General for Burundi.

After leaving the UN, Charles Petrie was, from March 2011 to September 2012, the

special policy advisor to the President of Somalia based in Villa Somalia Mogadishu.

From February 2012 to March 2015, upon the Myanmar government’s invitation, Charles

Petrie coordinated the Norwegian Government sponsored Myanmar Peace Support

Initiative. A mechanism set up to facilitate the discussions between the Government and

the Ethnic Armed Groups. In March 2012, Charles Petrie was designated by the UN

Secretary General to lead an internal review of the UN’s actions in Sri Lanka during the

last phase of the conflict. The report was submitted to the Secretary General in early

November of that year and served as the basis for the elaboration of the Secretary

General’s ‘Rights up Front’ policy – a policy that places protection at the forefront of all

UN action.

In the first half of 2015, Charles Petrie was designated as one of seven experts

commissioned by the UN Secretary General to review the UN's peace building efforts.

The report they produced contributed to the formulation of the joint UN General

Assembly (262) and UN Security Council Resolutions (2282) on ‘Sustaining Peace’. In

the latter part of 2016, he was invited to lead an assessment of the UN’s integrated

strategy for the Sahel. The recommendations of the report, submitted to the UN Security

Council in January 2017, formed the basis of the Presidential Statement on the Sahel.

Finally, as concerns the United Nations, Charles Petrie is providing mentoring support to

a number of newly appointed UN Resident Coordinators.

In addition to work he continues to undertake for the UN, Charles Petrie has also been

invited to provide policy guidance to various governments. From 2018-2019, he was advisorto the Syrian opposition. Funded by the German Government, he was tasked with helping


the opposition redefine its legitimacy following the losses in areas of control within Syria.

Since February 2021, Charles Petrie has been providing support to Myanmar civil society’s

opposition to the military. In this capacity he has been able to get a better sense of the limits

of traditional humanitarian aid in reaching those most affected. Coming out of these

observations has been the belief that a new model of international engagement needs to be

found and developed that is able to support the emergence of local governance structures

( https://www.devex.com/news/opinion-a-new-aid-model-can-better-assist-communities-

in-pariah-states-105617 ). In January-February 2024, Charles Petrie crossed in Myanmar

to get a better understanding of the governance structures in areas no longer under the

control of the Myanmar military (https://www.noemamag.com/a-journey-into-rebel-held-

myanmar/).

In August 2021, Charles Petrie published a book entitled The Triumph of Evil, which relates

the story of an attempt to get a former UN official to account for his alleged involvement in

the murder of thirty-two people, including UN colleagues. He is currently working on a

second book with the working title of Lyrics for Unsung Heroes. The book will honour

ordinary individuals whom he met over the years – individuals who have demonstrated

incredible courage and nobility.

Charles Petrie was named Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2014

New Year’s Honours list for services to international peace, security and human rights.

Upon his request, he received the award in Mogadishu. Following the death of his father

in October 2021, he became the sixth Baronet of Carrowcarden. Charles regularly serves as an IDHA Course Mentor.
