Taking place in Pretoria, South Africa, you will gain classroom and hands-on experience during four weeks of rigorous modules focused on humanitarian aid. Throughout the course, you will be able to work alongside peers from various humanitarian, emergency, and human rights organizations and learn from alumni practitioners and lecturers with worldwide experience.
