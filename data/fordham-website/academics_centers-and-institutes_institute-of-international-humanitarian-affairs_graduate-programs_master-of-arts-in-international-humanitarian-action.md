## Shaping Humanitarian Leaders

In a disaster, good intentions are not enough. To care for people at their most vulnerable, humanitarian aid workers need to take swift and mindful action. That makes on-the-ground skills and best practices absolutely critical.

A Master of Arts in International Humanitarian Action (MIHA) shapes humanitarians in the field to lead and transform international humanitarian response. Intensive courses, offered globally, challenge mid-career professionals to devise solutions alongside like-minded practitioners from around the world.

The program’s multidisciplinary approach equips humanitarians with the tools to respond thoughtfully and effectively in crises. Students apply theoretical learning in the classroom to the complex realities of humanitarian action to generate debate, gain knowledge, and craft solutions, emboldening them to put the innovative approaches they study throughout the program to practice in their own careers.
