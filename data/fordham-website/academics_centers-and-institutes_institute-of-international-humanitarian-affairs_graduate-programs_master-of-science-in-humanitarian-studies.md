# Master of Science in Humanitarian Studies

**Become a leader in humanitarian affairs**

Every year, millions of people around the world are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection. While conflict remains the main driver of humanitarian needs, increasingly conflict overlaps with climate disasters, infectious diseases and poverty often affecting the same communities. Built on social justice values and humanitarian principles, the Master of Science in Humanitarian Studies is a 30-credit interdisciplinary program and equips students with the knowledge and skills to respond and address the causes and consequences of humanitarian crises.

A Master of Science in Humanitarian Studies (MSHS) from Fordham University’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) will educate you to make meaningful contributions to humanitarian operations.
