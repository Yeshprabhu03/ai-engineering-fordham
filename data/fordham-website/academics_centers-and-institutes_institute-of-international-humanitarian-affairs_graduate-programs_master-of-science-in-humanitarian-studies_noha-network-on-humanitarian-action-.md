**What is the NOHA experience like?**

**Najia Ahadi is a recent graduate of the NOHA program. She continues to keep in touch. **

"I studied for my Master of Arts in International Humanitarian Action (MIHA) in the NOHA Joint Master’s program at Ruhr University of Bochum in Germany, Warsaw University in Poland, and Fordham University in Bronx, New York. This program has profoundly shaped my understanding of global humanitarian issues and equipped me with the skills necessary to make a meaningful impact in this field. Completing the MIHA program has been a transformative experience. It has fueled my passion for humanitarian work and equipped me with the ethical framework and practical skills to navigate complex challenges. I am now more committed than ever to advocating for vulnerable populations and contributing to effective humanitarian action.

Throughout the program, I had the privilege of attending lectures and workshops led by esteemed professionals in the field. These interactions not only enriched my learning but also expanded my professional network. I connected with individuals from various organizations, which has been invaluable in my career journey. One of the highlights of my program was a three-month internship as part of the school work. On the other hand, Fordham University, notably the Institute of International Humanitarian Affairs, has been supportive and responsive to all inquiries. Studying at Fordham has opened the door for other great opportunities in my career, for which I am so grateful."
