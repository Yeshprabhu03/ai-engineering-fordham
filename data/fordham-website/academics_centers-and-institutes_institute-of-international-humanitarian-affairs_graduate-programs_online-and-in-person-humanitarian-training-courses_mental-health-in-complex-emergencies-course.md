# Mental Health in Complex Emergencies Course

## Course Description*

*This course is online asynchronous

The Mental Health in Complex Emergencies (MHCE) course is designed for professionals in mental health and social work, staff in humanitarian health and protection programs and volunteers who wish to learn how to establish, enhance, or integrate mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) into humanitarian programmes. As they come together, each student and lecturer contributes their own unique experiences and insights in building a dynamic learning space.

The introductory course covers prevention, preparedness and response strategies that can be used with communities affected by diverse humanitarian emergencies, including conflict, post conflict, and disaster settings, and with refugees or internally displaced populations.

Students opt to receive either a Certificate of Completion or academic credit. In addition, they will have:

- an increased understanding of mental health and psychosocial needs and interventions in complex emergencies
- an understanding of important guidance documents, key issues, and debates within the field
- an introduction to the key capacities required for establishing MHPSS activities in the field
- critically reflected on their own role as a humanitarian actor

The course provides practical orientation and training on the technical processes of assessment, design, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. Significant attention will be given to understanding mental health problems and conditions and therapeutic approaches to address them in adults and children in humanitarian contexts. Other topics will include cultural validity and cultural change, and the practical aspects of security, well-being, and daily life in the field.

The ONLINE course reflects on the evolving nature of humanitarian emergencies, including the growing numbers of forcibly displaced people, the problems created by (chronic) conflict, and the climate and ecological emergencies.

Mohammed Omer Egil Elhaj, MHCE Alumnus | Humanitarian Protection & MHPSS Practitioner

"Completing the Mental Health in Complex Emergencies (MHCE) course with Fordham University and the IIHA has been an enriching milestone in my humanitarian journey. With over fifteen years of experience across Sudan, Yemen, Iraq, and the Middle East, I joined the program with a strong background in crisis and protection work. Yet, the MHCE course offered a uniquely structured and evidence-based approach to mental health and psychosocial support, helping me connect theory directly with practice. Concepts like trauma-informed care, community-based MHPSS, and ethical, culturally grounded interventions resonated deeply with my field experience. I benefited from the expertise of the facilitators and the insights of my peer colleagues, whose diverse perspectives enriched my understanding of resilience and hope in crises. I would encourage all my humanitarian protection colleagues to take part in this course, as the learning community itself is as valuable as the curriculum. I leave the MHCE program with strengthened skills, renewed commitment to survivor-centered and ethically grounded practice, and a deeper appreciation for integrating MHPSS across sectors."
