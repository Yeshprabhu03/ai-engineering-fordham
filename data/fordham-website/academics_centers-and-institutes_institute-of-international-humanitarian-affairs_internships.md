"I was introduced to the IIHA through some fantastic faculty members, and I'm very grateful for it. During my time at the IIHA, I was able to use my experience in international relations while exploring my passions in humanitarian affairs. Additionally, as an IIHA intern, I was asked to attend high-level events and made long-lasting connections, which I will never forget!"

- Connor Larson, Spring 2024 Communications Intern
