The Permanent Mission of Ireland to the United Nations and the Institute of International Humanitarian Affairs (IIHA), Fordham University, launched the [Ireland at Fordham Humanitarian Lecture Series](https://news.fordham.edu/politics-and-society/ireland-and-fordham-launch-lecture-series/) as a significant multiyear partnership between the Government of Ireland and Fordham University. The lecture series, which began in April 2019, ran until June 2020 with events in New York, Dublin, and Geneva.

The Ireland at Fordham Humanitarian Lecture Series speaks to Ireland’s profile as a leader in international development and humanitarian action as well as Fordham University’s commitment to research and education that assist in the promotion of justice, the protection of human rights, and respect for the environment. The series consisted of a number of distinguished lectures supported by a series of more technical lectures and workshops that are open to all.

Lectures explored the challenges facing policymakers and humanitarians as they seek to ensure that aid reaches those in need, that humanitarian principles are upheld, and that civilians are protected. Specific topics of discussion included humanitarian protection through international humanitarian law, humanitarian financing, climate and security, and more.
