# Humanitarian Fault Lines Podcast

Humanitarian Fault Lines, from Fordham University’s Institute of International Humanitarian Affairs, explores what’s wrong in the world of humanitarian affairs today - where the cracks lie and the actual and potential harm they create. Jamie McGoldrick examines some of the key challenges and why they have developed. He seeks voices to speak on these issues and what is, or isn’t, being done to address them. Ultimately, he looks for answers to some of the most difficult questions in the humanitarian world. Guests include Jan Egeland, Denise Brown, Hugo Slim, Adam Abdelmoula, Gabriella Waaijman, and so many more.
