# Refuge Gallery

The Refuge Gallery serves as a venue for exhibitions of artistic work relating to humanitarian and social justice issues. Using art as a means to illuminate, educate and provoke, the Refuge Gallery seeks to bring the Fordham community closer to the injustices experienced by our fellow global citizens.

Our vision is to create a stimulating environment encouraging of cultural and artistic inquiry through a social justice lens for our students, neighbors, artists, and the humanitarian sector — not only at the Institute but at Fordham University as a whole.
