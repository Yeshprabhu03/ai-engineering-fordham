# Internships

The IIHA serves as a support for internship placements, working closely with students to help with resumes, cover letters, and establishing connections with various organizations. Priority is given to those students enrolled in the Internship Seminar, but all students are encouraged to take advantage of the IIHA’s available resources. Students should generally begin the application process approximately two months before they wish to begin their internship. Current and past placements include:

- Action Against Hunger (ACF)
- Aid for AIDS
- American Red Cross
- Catholic Medical Mission Board (CMMB)
- Catholic Worker Concern Worldwide
- Covenant House
- Equality Now
- Girl Rising
- Global Nomads Group
- Global Poverty Project (GPP)
- Human Rights Watch (HRW)
- Immigration Equality
- International Legal Foundation
- International Rescue Committee (IRC)
- New York City Office of Emergency Management NGO
- Working Group on Food and Hunger at the United Nations
- Physicians for Human Rights
- United Nations Department of Public Information (UNDPI)
- United Nations World Food Programme (WFP)
- U.S. Fund for UNICEF

This list is not exhaustive, and it is important to note that while the IIHA has many New York based partner organizations, students are ultimately responsible for securing their internships through respective application processes. Students are not guaranteed placement with any particular organization.

Please note that internships are also available for students to work directly with the Institute of International Humanitarian Affairs.
