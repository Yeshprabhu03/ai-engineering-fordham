# New York Center for Public Anthropology and Sociology

## About the Center

Founded in 2022 by Ayala Fader PhD, Fordham’s New York Center for Public Anthropology & Sociology is guided by a commitment to public scholarship that benefits local partners, academic disciplines, and all of us in the shared space of New York. The Center believes that academic resources—interdisciplinary literatures, networks, and methodologies—can support vibrant partnerships with neighbors outside the academy, who bring their expertise in teaching, mentoring, community-building, and political activism.
