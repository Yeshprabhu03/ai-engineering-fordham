Members of the Orthodox Christian Studies Center Advisory Council

The Center Advisory Council's mission is to help the Center's Director and faculty strengthen teaching, research, and public understanding of Orthodox Christianity. Members strongly believe in the vibrant role the Center plays in the global Orthodox Church and in strengthening Orthodox-Roman Catholic relations. Council members assist the Center's Director in developing and executing strategy and provide critical links to people and institutions within and beyond the Fordham community.
