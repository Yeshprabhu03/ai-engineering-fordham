# Coptic Christianity Conference

## Between Archives and the Field: Cross-cutting Methods in Coptic Studies

**May 19-21, 2025****Fordham University Lincoln Center Campus Register Now**


The Orthodox Christian Studies Center is pleased to announce its inaugural conference in Coptic Christianity in the spring of 2025.

Whereas scholarly debate tends be organized along lines of periodization, this interdisciplinary conference aims to advance the study of Coptic Christianity in Egypt and its diasporas by drawing together scholars from anthropology, art history, history, literature, politics, sociology, and theology whose research highlights points of connection between late antiquity and the modern world. Convened by Dr. Mina Ibrahim (Marburg University) and Dr. Mona Oraby (Howard University), established and early-career scholars who work with a wide variety of sources will consider how the deliberate exchange and adoption of new methods enriches our understanding of institutions, heritage, otherness, and memory.

The conference is free and open to the public. Registration required.
