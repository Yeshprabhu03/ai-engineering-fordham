The rise of public-facing Christian nationalism in the United States comes as a shock to the American political and religious sensibility. Religious nationalism, however, is nothing new in most countries around the world, where the line between national, ethnic, and religious identities remains fluid and often indiscernible. The Orthodox Christian Studies Center will gather scholars to discuss the geopolitical and ecclesial significance of the rise of new and the perdurance of old forms of religious nationalism.
