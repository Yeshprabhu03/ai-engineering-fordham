# The Shape of the Sacred: Eastern Christianity and Architectural Modernity

**Presented by Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America and the Orthodox Christian Studies Center of Fordham University**

Churches and other sacred buildings are expected to orient worshipers in relation to a transcendent cosmic reality while addressing ever-changing social conditions, urban development patterns, building technologies, and artistic forms. This three-day public international symposium explores the challenges of the dialogue between contemporary architecture and theological concepts of space. Sponsored by the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America in association with Fordham University, the symposium will be the first of its kind in North America. It honors the recently built and consecrated Saint Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church and National Shrine, located at the World Trade Center and designed by Santiago Calatrava. The symposium includes a special event at Saint Nicholas Shrine featuring a welcome address by His Eminence Archbishop Elpidophoros of America and a keynote conversation.

**May 30 - June 1, 2023**

**Fordham University (Lincoln Center Campus) / Saint Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church and National Shrine Free and open to the public**
