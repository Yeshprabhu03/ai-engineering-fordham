During the academic year, the Orthodox Christian Fellowship hosts bimonthly LOGOS gatherings where students pray together, talk about the week, and try to grow together in faith. OCF students volunteer at Emmaus House of Harlem, a center serving homeless families.

In 2014, the center commissioned a set of liturgical items from Andreas Mantzioutas, an artist in Greece who specializes in creating traditional Orthodox Christian liturgical pieces. The members of the Orthodox Christian Studies Center are deeply grateful to the Maguire family for this tangible expression of their love for the liturgical life of Fordham students and for the commitment to the mission of the Orthodox Christian Studies Center.

The Orthodox Christian Fellowship meets thanks to the support of Fordham's Office of Campus Ministry.
