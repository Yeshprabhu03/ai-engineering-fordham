# Orthodox Christian Studies Fellowship

The Orthodox Christian Studies Center welcomes undergraduate and graduate students to become fellows of the Center. There are no prerequisites and or/major/minor requirements; students only need to bring with them curiosity to learn together. The fellowship program encourages students to learn more about the history, thought, and culture of the Orthodox Christian world broadly understood by participating in Center events and meeting our guest speakers. Through the Fellowship Program, the Center aims to build an intellectual community that includes students, faculty, and community members.

Participation in the program involves a commitment to attend at least three in-person Center events during a semester and writing a short reflection paper on those events. In exchange for their participation, students will be awarded a small stipend at the end of the semester.
