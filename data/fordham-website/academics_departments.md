Four [undergraduate colleges](/academics/colleges-and-schools/undergraduate-schools/), six [graduate and professional schools](/academics/colleges-and-schools/graduate-schools/), more than 60 [undergraduate degrees](/undergraduate-admission/majors-and-minors/), more than 70 graduate degrees and certificate programs, and [centers and institutes](/academics/centers-and-institutes/) that study poverty, genetics, politics, urban ecology, and dozens of other areas — we are a comprehensive research institution whose programs span the breadth of human experience.

### New York as Your Classroom

Each of our departments and programs makes our home in New York City part of the curriculum.

Theatre major? You might stage an off-Broadway production. Studying the sciences? Our Rose Hill campus is literally across the street from the New York Botanical Garden. Pursuing a graduate degree in business or a law degree? A dedicated network of alumni on Wall Street and in the local, state, and federal courts serve as mentors in our classrooms.
