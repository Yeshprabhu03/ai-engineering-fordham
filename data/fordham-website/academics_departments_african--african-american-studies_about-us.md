# About African and African American Studies

The Department of African and African American Studies (AAAS) at Fordham University was founded in 1969, making it one of the oldest departments of its kind in the nation, and one of the most admired for the quality of its faculty and graduates. The department serves dually as an academic unit and a community, composed of students and faculty interested in the interdisciplinary study of Africa and its diaspora.
