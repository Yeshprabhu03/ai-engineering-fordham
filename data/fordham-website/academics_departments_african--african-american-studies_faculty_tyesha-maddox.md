Tyesha Maddox is an Associate Professor at Fordham University in the Department of African and African American Studies. She received her Ph.D. in History from New York University in 2016. Her BA in History and Africana Studies and a MPS in Africana Studies both from Cornell University.

Her monograph

(University of Pennsylvania Press 2024) engages multiple historiographies, including those concerning Caribbean migration, immigration to the U.S., transnational history, women’s history, African American history, Caribbean history, and the historiography of social organizations in the United States. It examines the significance of Anglophone Caribbean mutual aid societies and benevolent associations in New York (1890–1940) and argues that participation in these organizations: played a vital role in the formation of transnational identities; facilitated in community building; and created transnational kinship networks that both empowered immigrants to form a collective “Caribbean” identity and unleashed a political activism among immigrants fighting alongside African Americans to ensure equality during the tumultuous era of American Jim Crow and grant access to economic opportunities that would ensure their future success.*A Home Away from Home Mutual Aid, Political Activism, and Caribbean American Identity*In 2020, she co-edited a comprehensive resource guide and website titled "This is Not a Riot!" (
