The goal of the [Bronx African American History Project (BAAHP)](/academics/research/libraries-and-collections/bronx-african-american-history-project/) is to recover and document previously untold histories of more than 500,000 residents of African descent in the Bronx with roots in the U.S. South, West Indies, and Africa. Key research areas of the BAAHP include Bronx Jazz History, roots of Bronx Hip-Hop, Caribbean, and African Immigration to the Bronx.
