# American Studies Courses

American Studies students have the opportunity to select from between 90-120 courses each semester. In addition to the Core Major and Minor courses, our students also receive credit towards their major or minor by taking an array of courses draw from nearly a dozen departments and program taught by more than 50 affiliated faculty members.

Our major is an exceptionally flexible major, tailored to individual research interests, and culminated in a capstone senior thesis presentation in the fall of the senior year. View the [major checklist](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/american-studies/pdfs/AMST_Major_Checklist.pdf).
