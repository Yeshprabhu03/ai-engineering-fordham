The Art History program plays a vital role in the intellectual life of Fordham University's undergraduates, teaching students the necessary skills to analyze and appreciate non-verbal modes of expression.

We offer [exceptional breadth](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/undergraduate/art-history/#coursestext), both temporally and geographically, spanning from the ancient to the contemporary world and encompassing Europe, the Americas, Africa, and Asia. In addition to traditional art historical analysis, several courses engage directly with curatorial and museum studies. Students take full advantage of Fordham’s New York City location by regularly visiting world-class museums and galleries as part of their coursework. As a relatively small program with five full-time faculty members, Art History at Fordham fosters close mentorship and individualized academic guidance.

Many students independently secure internships at leading cultural institutions, pursue undergraduate research opportunities, and participate in [study abroad programs](https://www.fordham.edu/study-abroad/) through Fordham’s partnerships with institutions around the world. Graduates go on to thrive in careers across museums, education, NGOs, commercial galleries, auction houses, and competitive graduate programs.

Art History at Fordham is highly interdisciplinary. Many courses count toward other academic programs, including African American Studies, Asian American Studies, Medieval Studies, Urban Studies, Chinese Studies, Fashion Studies, and Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, among others (see below).
