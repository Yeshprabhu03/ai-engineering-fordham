# Vasari Lecture

## Art history students present their own original research

*(reconceptualized at the Vasari Symposium, beginning in 2021)*

Up until 2019, every year, one art history major was selected to give the annual Vasari Lecture, presenting research pursued in the Art History Senior Seminar. We are proud of the work that our students have done, and we encourage you to take a look at the titles of the Vasari Lectures listed below.

In 2021 through 2025, we developed an alternate structure, where several students presented their original research at an event re-branded as the Vasari Symposium. Please see the details for those presentations below.

Named for the 16th-century Italian artist/scholar Giorgio Vasari, whose publications The Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors and Architects (1550; 1568) are among the most influential examples of art historical writing, the Vasari Lectures and Symposia are where the intellectual diversity of Fordham's art history program comes to life.
