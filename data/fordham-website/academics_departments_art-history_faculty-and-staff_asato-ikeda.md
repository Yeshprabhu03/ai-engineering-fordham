### Biography

Originally from Tokyo, Japan, she earned post-secondary degrees in Canada. Her research interests lie in modern Japanese art in particular and Asian art in general, and the topics of imperialism/colonialism, war, fascism, museums, sex, gender, sexuality, and transnational exhange.

Her primary research is about Japanese paintings produced during the Second World War. Her first monograph on the topic, [ The Politics of Painting: Fascism and Japanese Art during the Second World War](https://uhpress.hawaii.edu/title/the-politics-of-painting-fascism-and-japanese-art-during-the-second-world-war/), was published by the University of Hawai’i Press in 2018. The book presents a study of non-battle Japanese paintings produced in the 1930s and early 1940s, using the concept of Japanese fascism as an interpretive framework to understand the political nature of seemingly unproblematic paintings with traditional icons such as Mount Fuji, historical figures, beautiful women, and rural landscapes. She has also co-edited the first English-language anthology on the topic of Japanese war art,

*Art and War in Japan and its Empire*, 1931-1960She has also been active as a curator, and has been keen to engage with the public about important social and political issues through art. Most recently, with Joshua S. Mostow, Ikeda curated the exhibition [ A Third Gender: Beautiful Youths in Japanese Prints](https://shop.japansociety.org/catalogues/a-third-gender) at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Canada (2016) and Japan Society (2017) which focused on the social and sexual role of male youths in Edo-period Japan. She was involved with the exhibition

[installed at Takamado Gallery in Tokyo, the Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia, Burnaby Nikkei Center, and Carleton Art Gallery between 2011 and 2014](https://www.historymuseum.ca/boutique/product/inuit-prints-japanese-inspiration/)

*Japanese Inspiration: Early Printmaking in the Canadian Arctic*Ikeda is currently writing her second monograph, *Japan in Canada: The Art and Visual Culture of Transpacific Crossings*, which will be the first in-depth art historical study to look at the emergence of a new culture in Canada that reflects the increased transpacific crossings of people and objects to and from Japan before the Second World War. The book not only investigates the collection, circulation, and production of photographs, prints, posters, postcards, and art exhibition catalogues across the Pacific, but also complicates the binary between “white racists” and “Japanese victims” by illuminating the diversity of both white and Japanese populations.
