# Asian American Studies Minor

The Asian American studies minor requires six courses.

- AAST 3000: Introduction to Asian American Studies

- Four AAST electives, at least three of which must carry either the AAST subject code or the AAST attribute code (the fourth may carry either the AAST subject code, the AAST attribute code, or the AASR attribute code)

- One course numbered 3000 or above in a contiguous field of race and ethnic studies—i.e., a course with either an African & African American studies (AFAM) subject code, an AFAM attribute code, a Latin American and Latino studies (LALS) subject code, or an LALS attribute code

Students may try to fulfill any of the above requirements by submitting a [waiver/substitution](https://www.fordham.edu/download/downloads/id/12470/waiver_substitution_form.pdf) request form to the AAST program director on their campus. Program directors will have sole discretion over whether to grant waiver/substitution requests. In general, however, the following guidelines will apply:

- To count as an elective with an AAST subject code or an AAST attribute code, at least half the syllabus must focus on methods or content directly pertinent to Asian American studies, broadly understood.

- To count as an elective with an AASR attribute code, at least one-third of the syllabus must focus on methods or content directly pertinent to Asian American studies, broadly understood.

- To count as a contiguity course, the course must be numbered 3000 or above; and at least half the syllabus must focus directly on methods or content directly pertinent to African American studies, U.S. Latinx studies, or Indigenous studies, all broadly understood.
