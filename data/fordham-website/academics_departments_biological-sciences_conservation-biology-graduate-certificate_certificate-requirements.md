# Certificate Requirements

The graduate certificate in conservation biology can be completed in 8 to 11 months and is awarded after completion of 15 graduate credits, including two core courses (Conservation Biology and Conservation Law and Policy), two elective courses from an approved list, and an individually designed practicum, which may consist of a supervised independent research project or a sponsored internship with a governmental or nonprofit organization.

Applicants should have completed a B.A./B.S. in biology or other natural/environmental science, or equivalent coursework. An undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or higher is required. GRE scores are not required. Applicants without the required background will be advised to take necessary prerequisite courses. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis, and students may begin their studies in any term, including summer. View the information on tuition and fees and financial aid.
