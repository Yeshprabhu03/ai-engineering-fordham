The main focus of my laboratory is the physiological ecology and comparative biochemistry of heterothermy in mammals. The impacts of two current challenges facing mammals that employ torpor as a survival strategy are presently being studied. One problem that my laboratory is currently investigating is White-nose Syndrome (WNS), an emergent disease that is estimated to have killed over 5,000,000 bats in the eastern USA and Canada. WNS was first observed at a single cave in New York State during the winter of 2005-2006, and has since spread to > 190 bat hibernation sites located in 33 U.S. states and 7 Canadian provinces. The fungus that causes WNS is

*Pseudogymnoascus destructans*, and it grows on the muzzles, wings, and ears of hibernating bats. Field studies indicate that cutaneous infection with P. destructans causes mortality through the disruption of normal torpor patterns during hibernation. Studies are presently being conducted by my laboratory on the role of cutaneous lipids in the resistance to infection with*P. destructans*, and the long-term effects of WNS on several bat populations in New York. My laboratory is also examining the effects of recent climate warming on the hibernation and over-winter survival of eastern chipmunks (*Tamias**striatus*). -
