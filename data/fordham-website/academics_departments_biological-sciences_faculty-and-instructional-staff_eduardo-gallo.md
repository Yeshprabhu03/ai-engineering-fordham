The Gallo Lab studies the neural basis of motivated behavior. Energizing of behavior in pursuit of a goal is essential for an animal’s survival. Whether an animal engages in goal-directed behavior depends on intricate cost-benefit calculations that weigh reward value, effort, time, and risk, and is subject to influence of environmental cues, internal states, and previous experience. These motivational processes are mediated by different brain regions, but our understanding of the neuronal populations, and the circuitry that enables their crosstalk, is still limited. Perturbations in these neural circuits have been implicated in the motivational dysfunction observed in various disorders including substance abuse, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), pathological obesity, and schizophrenia.

Our main interest is to dissect the role of distinct neuronal populations and neural circuits of the basal ganglia in reward and motivated behavior. To achieve this goal, we use a multidisciplinary approach, taking advantage of genetic and viral tools in mice, electrophysiology, behavioral assays, neuroanatomical and biochemical analyses, and techniques to manipulate and monitor neuronal activity

*in vitro*and*in vivo*such as optogenetics, pharmacogenetics and calcium imaging.Currently, the focus of my laboratory is to determine the contribution of cholinergic neurons in the basal ganglia to motivated behavior and to the shaping of striatal circuits. Some of the ongoing questions driving our research are: How does dopamine and its receptors alter cholinergic neuron firing? What is the significance of altered firing to behaviors that involve both natural and drug rewards? Are alterations in intracellular signaling pathways involved? What are the most prominent functional connections to these neurons that affect their function? How do these neurons in turn influence the function of other cells? By studying the neuroanatomical and functional diversity of specific neurons mediating reward, we hope to provide new insight into the motivational dysfunction seen in these disorders.
