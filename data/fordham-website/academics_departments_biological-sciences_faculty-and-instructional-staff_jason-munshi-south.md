Members of the Munshi-South lab at Fordham University’s Louis Calder Center are dedicated to understanding the behavioral, ecological, and evolutionary impacts of large-scale human disturbance on wild vertebrate populations. Current lab projects are primarily focused on understanding the evolutionary implications of urbanization for wildlife in the New York City metropolitan area. For these studies, we employ complementary approaches from field ecology, population genomics, landscape genomics, and computational biology. We study urban populations as model systems of rapid microevolution, but also aim to provide data for urban conservation and restoration efforts. To this end we collaborate with local government agencies and non-profits.

**Opportunities**

Graduate and undergraduate positions are available in the lab for multiple projects. For more information, please see the lab website and contact me at[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#046e69716a776c6d776b71706c44626b76606c65692a616071). -
