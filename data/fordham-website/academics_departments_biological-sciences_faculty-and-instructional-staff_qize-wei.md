Cell division and cell migration are critical biological processes that are ultimately regulated by the microtubule and/or actomyosin cytoskeleton. Dysregulation of these biological processes is often associated with cancer development and progression as well as with developmental defects in humans. Our lab is interested in understanding the molecular mechanisms that modulate the organization of the microtubule and actomyosin cytoskeleton. Currently, we are using knockout mice and cultured mammalian cells as model systems to investigate: 1) how MyoGEF, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, regulates cytokinesis and breast cancer cell invasion; 2) how CCDC69, a coiled-coil protein, contributes to the regulation of microtubule stabilization and central spindle assembly; and 3) how Pitx2, a homeodomain transcription factor that is involved in left-right patterning during embryonic development, is implicated in cytoskeletal regulation and cancer development. A combination of molecular, cellular, and biochemical approaches is used in our research.

Students who are interested in working in the lab should feel free to contact me at
