Neurobiology; Ion Channel Disorder Mechanisms; Ion Channel Molecular Biology. Gene expression, biosynthesis, trafficking, regulation, and function of membrane proteins (e.g. channels, receptors, pumps, transporters): Membrane proteins play critical roles in all cells. ~25% of mammalian genomes code for these proteins which are expressed in the plasma membrane and organelle membranes of all cells. Nervous systems rely on ion channels for simple reflexes to complex interactions involved in learning/memory. Ion channels set the resting membrane potential, affect excitability, and generate and modify action potentials in excitable cells- they also play other important roles in all cells. Our overall goal is to elucidate underlying principles/mechanisms governing membrane protein biology in the normal and disease state, particularly for ion channels, as well as to identify new roles for membrane proteins in cell/animal biology.

We are: (a) Identifying amino acid determinants on ion channels (e.g. potassium channels and glutamate receptor channels) that play positive and negative roles in their intracellular trafficking from the ER to the Golgi and from the Golgi to the cell surface and elucidating which determinant is dominant when heteromeric channels are expressed. These determinants affect the channel's cell surface level. (b) Determining the effects of glycosylation and phosphorylation in ion channel biology. Glycosylation, particularly sialidation in the Golgi, does affect channel function and it also affects cell surface levels of some channels. ER-dependent phosphorylation of some channels may also affect their cell surface levels. (c) Investigating the role of abnormal trafficking to the cell surface of mutant ion channels in human disorders (e.g. Episodic Ataxia I, SpinoCerebellar Ataxia 13). (d) Examining the role ofchannel mRNA untranslated regions in modifying their protein expression levels. (e) Cloning/characterizing new channels.

Modifying cell surface levels or function of ion channels by posttranslational mechanisms could increase or fine tune the functional response of a cell by altering its signaling characteristics. Understanding the role of posttranslational modifications and different trafficking programs of ion channels to the cell surface also has clinical relevance because a number of human disorders are caused by alterations or mutations that affect these parameters (e.g. ER retention disorders such as a form of episodic ataxia, epilepsy, long QT syndrome, and cystic fibrosis).
