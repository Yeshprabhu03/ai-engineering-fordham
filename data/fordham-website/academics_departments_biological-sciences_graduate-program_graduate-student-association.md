The members of the Biology Graduate Student Association are fairly social without any formal structure. Many of the members live within close proximity to each other and often get together for game nights, dinner, or television viewing parties. We frequently head down to Manhattan for a dose of city life and culture or north for hiking, skiing, and camping. Plus, all first year Biology Graduate Student Association students are welcomed to the department with pizza and beer from Pugsley's!
