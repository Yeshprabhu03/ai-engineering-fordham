## Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Faculty Position

Applications are invited for a tenure-track position in Ecology or Evolutionary Biology at the Assistant Professor level in the Department of Biological Sciences at Fordham’s Rose Hill Campus in the Bronx, New York, beginning Fall 2026.

The applicant will conduct research in ecology, evolutionary biology or the intersection of these fields in an area that complements the existing strengths of the department. Applicants will contribute to graduate and undergraduate teaching and research mentoring.

We offer undergraduate biology majors and non-majors courses, connection with the Environmental Sciences program, MS and PhD graduate programs in Biology, and a graduate Conservation Certificate.

We have research facilities at the Rose Hill campus in the Bronx and at the Louis Calder Center Biological Field Station and are especially interested in recruiting a colleague whose research program could include research, training and mentoring activities at the station.

Members of the Department collaborate with colleagues and programs at institutions including the neighboring New York Botanical Garden (NYBG) and the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS)/ Bronx Zoo and the American Museum of Natural History. We also work with state and local agencies. Fordham is part of the Bronx Science Consortium which includes Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Health System, the NYBG and the WCS.

Applicants are required to have a Ph.D. in a life science or related field, and should have postdoctoral or equivalent experience and a record of published work. The successful candidates will be expected to supervise an independent research program that will attract extramural funding, provide research opportunities and mentoring for graduate and undergraduate students and offer professional service to the Department and University.

To apply, submit a cover letter, curriculum vitae, contact information for three references, research and teaching statements, and three reprints via Interfolio [https://apply.interfolio.com/171620](https://apply.interfolio.com/171620).
