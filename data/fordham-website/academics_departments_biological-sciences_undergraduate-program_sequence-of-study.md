# Biological Sciences Sequence of Study

The following is a sample course selection for a student declaring the biological sciences major in Fordham College - Rose Hill. Courses taken are not indicated by semester and, except for the sequenced courses, which must be taken in numerical order, sequencing is at the discretion of the student. As a general rule, five courses (two of these in the major) must be taken each semester of freshman and sophomore year, except for one semester of freshman year (usually the first) when only four courses (two of them being Introductory Biology and Chemistry) are taken. Note that associated lecture and lab courses are counted as a single course.
