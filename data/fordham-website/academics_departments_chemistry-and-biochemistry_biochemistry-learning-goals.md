# Biochemistry Student Learning Goals

Learning Goals and Expected Outcomes Biochemistry

Students can pursue a track of their choice (American Chemical Society track) or the

General track. The B.S. Degree in Biochemistry provides students with a solid foundation

to pursue a career in medicine or dental school; top notch graduate school, pharmacology, nursing, clinical research, forensic science, cosmetic chemistry and beyond.

- Learn about the structure, and function of biological building blocks such as amino acids, lipids and fats; carbohydrates and their implications in metabolism and disease.
- Students should be able to decipher how biomolecules interact chemically and biologically; and understand their key role in molecular interactions at the cellular level.
- Understand basic concepts of drug design.
- Apply thermodynamic and kinetic principles to elucidate molecular driving forces in biochemical reactions and mechanisms of enzymes.
- Learn about biological pathways implicated in diseases including cancer, diabetes and obesity; and neurodegenerative diseases.
- Be able to work on a research plan/ proposal, conduct investigations and perform analyses. Students will learn to analyze and interpret data, including critically analyze

experimental design and data interpretation in the biochemical literature - Develop effective biochemical laboratory skills and design experiments that entail the use of biochemical / biophysical and bioanalytical methods.
- Become familiar with the use of instrumentation in modern biochemistry.
- Be able to demonstrate quantitative analysis and biocomputational skills.
- Effectively communicate the language of biochemistry through written and oral communication skills.
