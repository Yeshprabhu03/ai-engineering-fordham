**I. Nanomaterials for Renewable Energy**

There has been a recent and growing demand for green, renewable energy sources to replace fossil fuels. Our group focuses on two key areas in renewable energy:i.) Converting sunlight into electricity and fuels using photoelectrochemical cells: A promising approach to satisfying our nation’s energy needs is to convert solar energy either into electricity or directly into renewable fuels such as hydrogen. However, the efficiency of these energy conversion processes remains relatively low. In this context, we are focusing our efforts on synthesizing and tailoring the properties of nanostructured metal-containing materials to improve their photoelectrochemical performance in working devices. An important example includes the dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cell (DSPC) device, which converts solar energy to either electricity or to solar fuels.

**Converting Solar Energy to Electricity with DSPCs**: Light from the sun is absorbed by a dye molecule leading to the excitation of electron from the ground state to the excited state. This excited electron is captured by the metal oxide nanoparticles that the dye is attached to and is passed through an external circuit producing electricity. The circuit is completed by an electrolyte with an iodine containing redox couple. These devices (right image) can be prepared in our laboratory using simple assembly techniques and have efficiencies of up to 9%. (Ref:, 2011, 23, 3381-3399. Copyright 2011 American Chemical Society)[Chemistry of Materials](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cm200651e?journalCode=cmatex&quickLinkVolume=23&quickLinkPage=3381&selectedTab=citation&volume=23)ii.) Utilizing renewable fuels to power homes and automobiles with fuel cells: The electrochemical oxidation of the fuel and reduction of oxygen is facilitated by catalysts, which typically consist of small (2 – 4 nm) spherical platinum nanoparticles. Although platinum is the best element to catalyze the reactions, platinum’s extremely high cost and low abundance prevents large scale use of platinum in fuel cells. Our interest is in designing new fuel cell catalysts that have higher catalytic activity and better long-term durability, while utilizing abundant and less expensive metals. We accomplish this task by tuning the size, shape, and composition of the catalyst itself to improve overall performance.

Hollow Nanoparticles in Action as Fuel Cell Catalysts: The image on the left depicts a high angle annular dark field (HAADF) TEM image of a 12.5 nm hollow Pt-Ag nanoparticle. The energy dispersive X-ray maps show that the Pt and Ag components are uniformly mixed in the particle’s shell. The hollow particples were found to have more than five-fold higher catalytic activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction than state-of-the-art commercial Pt nanoparticles.

The high cost of precious metals has also hindered their widespread use as electrocatalysts for the oxidation and detection of small organic molecules such as ethanol and glucose. Thus, the development of cost-effective electrocatalysts can have broad commercial implications and can contribute to broader global challenges in energy and health care costs. We are focusing our efforts on developing new nanostructured architectures as cost-effective catalysts with high sensitivity and selectivity for a wide range of small organic molecules.![Electrochemical sensors detecting biologically relevant small organic molecules](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/Electrochemical_Sensors___Detecting_Biologically_Relevant_Small_Organic_Molecules.jpg)
