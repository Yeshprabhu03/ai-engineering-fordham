# Chemistry Department Scholarships

[Internal Research Grants](/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/undergraduate-research-and-internships/research-opportunities-and-support/grant-opportunities/)

FCRH offers three types of grants for eligible students interested in conducting research:

- Undergraduate Research Grants: Financial support for students conducting research during the academic year. ($1,600 per student project.)
- Summer Research Grants: Financial support for students conducting research during the summer. ($3,000 student stipend plus on-campus housing.)
- Travel Grants: Financial support for students presenting their research at a professional conference.

Grant proposals are written with a faculty mentor and require their letter of recommendation. Applications for summer research grants are due in the spring so it is imperative that you find and faculty mentor and discuss a project by February!

[The Clare Boothe Luce Undergraduate Scholarship](https://www.fordham.edu/info/28933/clare_boothe_luce_undergraduate_scholarship_program)

Fordham University has been given a grant from the Clare Boothe Luce Scholarship Fund to award scholarships each year to outstanding sophomore women who are majoring in chemistry, biochemistry, biology, physics, mathematics or computer science, and who *are not planning medical careers*. The scholarship fund was set up by Mrs. Luce in her will in order to encourage women to enter those math and science fields in which they have not been well represented.

The Fordham scholarship recipients will be designated "Clare Booth Luce Scholars," and the award will cover tuition for their junior and senior years. A stipend will also be provided for research at Fordham during the summer between junior and senior years.

Sophomores interested in applying for the scholarship should contact their class Dean in the fall of their sophomore year. Applications are due in the spring of the sophomore year. Awardees are expected to pursue research in their field with a faculty mentor by the fall of the award period. It is thus very beneficial to have a research relationship in place before or during the application period.
