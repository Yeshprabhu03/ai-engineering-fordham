The Department participates actively in the Fordham College Core Curriculum.

**Latin and Greek**

Classes in Latin or Greek fulfill the Fordham College foreign language requirement.

- The BA requirement may be fulfilled by completing language courses in Greek or Latin up to the 2001 level. This is a four semester sequence consisting of LATN or GREK 1001, 1002, 1501, and 2001.

- Students with sufficient previous language training may be placed directly into the intermediate course (LATN or GREK 1501) or literature-level course (LATN or GREK 2001).

**Civilization and History**

- HIST 1200-Introduction to Ancient History is a sophomore core area history course.

- Courses in classical mythology, drama, and law are offered at the core enrichment level. CLAS 1210, CLAS 1240, and CLAS 1250 are core curriculum literature courses.
