Fordham University hosts the Epsilon Mu chapter of Eta Sigma Phi, an honor society for outstanding students of Greek and Latin languages. Students are chosen for membership based on academic performance in the classical languages and are inducted in the spring. The Fordham chapter of Eta Sigma Phi has attended Classics events in New York City, including Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibits, the Barnard/Columbia ancient drama productions, and tours of Fordham's own classical antiquities museum. On campus, it has also sponsored movie nights as well as regular club meetings. Its members have sat for the New York Classical Club Latin and Greek translation exams. A Fordham student recently took home first prize in the Greek translation exam. Please contact the chapter advisor, Professor Landrey ([[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)) with any questions.
