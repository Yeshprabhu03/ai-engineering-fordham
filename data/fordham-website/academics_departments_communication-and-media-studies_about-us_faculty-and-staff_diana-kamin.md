Diana Kamin's broad research interests include intersections of visual culture and information history. Her current book, Picture-Work: How Libraries, Museums, and Stock Agencies Launched a New Image Economy, forthcoming from MIT Press, identifies the ways in which the practical work of building 20th century image collections lay the groundwork for today’s circulation of images as mobile capital.
