Matthew Hockenberry is a media historian and theorist examining the media of global production. His current work develops a media history of logistics, exploring critical developments in the epistemology of assembly by tracing how new forms of knowledge shaped the emergence of logistical production and distribution. He is particularly concerned with the transitional moments of mediation found in histories of paperwork, telecommunication, and computation, and his broader research interests include media history, media industries, logistics, infrastructure, and mobile media.
