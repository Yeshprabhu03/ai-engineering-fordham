# Communication and Media Studies Department Undergraduate Student Resources

The faculty and staff of the Department of Communication and Media Studies are here to help students maximize their overall academic experience. From the moment students' studies begin, we work to keep you informed of additional opportunities and support.

Such opportunities can include Internships and nearly all of our majors and minors intern during their academic careers. Fordham students are highly valued as interns by New York area media companies for their strong critical thinking skills and positive attitude.

Another opportunity we offer students is to study abroad. We have dozens of students who study at campuses around the world every year, including Fordham's own programs in London and Pretoria. Our majors have studied on six continents just in the last three years alone.

Our top students are also eligible for induction into Lambda Pi Eta, the national communications honor society. The members of Fordham's chapter hold guest lectures and other special events, and also serve as student ambassadors for during admissions events.

We value all of the work that you do and support your efforts in obtaining your academic goals. Below, you will find useful links to ensure your academic success.
