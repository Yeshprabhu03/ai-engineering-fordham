# CMS Advising

The Department of Communication and Media Studies offers students faculty-based advising for declared or intended CMS majors and minors. Our advisors are specialists who research and teach in the areas of Communication and Media Studies, Digital Technology and Emerging Media, Film and Television, and Journalism. They are available to discuss the learning outcomes, philosophies and methodologies of a major area of study; clarify distinctions among major concentrations; and assist in course selections based on student interests and goals.
