# Communication and Media Studies Honor Society

Fordham University’s Communication and Media Studies department is proud to have its own chapter of Lambda Pi Eta (LPH), the Official Communication Studies Honor Society of the National Communication Association (NCA). With more than 400 active chapters at four-year colleges and universities nationwide, Lambda Pi Eta recognizes and fosters outstanding scholastic achievement in communication studies, and encourages professional development among all four CMS majors.

Specifically, Fordham’s chapter of Lambda Pi Eta strives to create an organization based on networking, academic and professional development, and collaboration between communication scholars, professors, and students. Being a member of Lambda Pi Eta shows that you are among an elite group of students who are dedicated to making positive contributions to the media industry. Lambda Pi Eta sets a high standard for excellence as it aims to create an environment in which students and faculty can have valuable and meaningful exchanges both inside and outside the classroom.

Applicants must have a 3.2 cumulative GPA and a 3.5 major GPA at the time of his/her submission.

Each fall, a select group of students are inducted into Fordham's chapter of Lambda Pi Eta at a special ceremony attended by prior inductees, special guest speakers, communications faculty, and members of Fordham's administration. Previous keynote speakers included MacArthur award-winning communication scholar Michael Schudson, currently teaching at Columbia University's Journalism School; Terence Moran, professor in NYU's media, culture, & communication program, and scholar; and activist Katherine Fry, professor in Brooklyn College, CUNY's Department of Television and Radio. In addition to the annual induction ceremony, our chapter hosts numerous events throughout the year exclusively for LPH members. Some past events include conversations/ networking sessions with Alex Trebek (host of "Jeopardy), Jeffrey Salgo (former director at CBS for 30+ years), and Mary Leach (Chief Marketing Officer, Movado Group).
