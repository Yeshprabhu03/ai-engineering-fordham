# Applying for Study Abroad with Communication and Media Studies

Before going:

- Visit the study abroad office on your campus
- Get two recommendations: one from the student's academic adviser (who will serve to write one of the two required recommendations), and one from the study abroad adviser for the department.
- Make an appointment to meet with
[Dr. Lewis Freeman](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bad6dfdcc8dfdfd7dbd4fadcd5c8ded2dbd794dfdecf), CMS study abroad Adviser, to determine which courses from the foreign program could serve as electives for the CMS majors.

By mid-October, Fordham's study abroad office requires a form completed by you and approved by the department’s study abroad adviser (and the faculty member in your minor) if you hope courses abroad will count toward your minor]) indicating the courses you are proposing abroad for major and minor credit. You might include some 'fallbacks' besides your preferred ones, just in case the preferred ones turn out not to be available once you get overseas.

This form is the "Course Approval Form," and is available from the Office of Study Abroad. It requires the department's study abroad adviser's signature next to any courses you hope to substitute for department credit.

On the form, you must list the courses (preferred and backup) you are planning to take abroad toward your major and/or minor. In general, our department can approve up to two courses taken abroad as counting toward our majors (your minor department may have a different policy).

For your meeting with Prof. Freeman, please bring:

- The course approval form from study abroad office
- One copy of your DegreeWorks academic record to date
- A list of course descriptions for the courses you hope to take abroad that might be eligible for department credit.
- A list of the specific courses you have completed/are taking in CMS and of any core, major, or minor requirements you still need to take.

After completion of your study abroad program and after the courses have been entered on DegreeWorks, then contact Prof. Freeman to have for the courses moved from general electives, to the communication electives area of DegreeWorks.
