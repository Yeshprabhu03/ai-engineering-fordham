Fordham’s M.S. in Cybersecurity has everything I was looking for in an advanced degree. Coming from a Computer Engineering background, I intended to explore my interests in Network Design and Cryptography. Not only was I encouraged to pursue those areas at Fordham, but I was also surprised by finding new interests in Blockchain Technology, for example, through courses and scientific research conducted by leading experts. Furthermore, I have also been able to enhance my soft skills by joining the Fordham Cybersecurity Club. As part of the organization, I learned a lot by helping organize networking events, capture-the-flag competitions, and workshops on security awareness.

The Fordham M.S. in Cybersecurity (MSCY) program has given me the opportunity to delve into the diverse field of cybersecurity, offering classes in forensics, policy-making, and even data mining. As a CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service student, I can fully explore my interests through the Fordham curriculum and intern with the United States government. Fordham’s investment in future talent is undeniable and can be seen through the cybersecurity department’s search for students of different backgrounds and undergraduate majors. All in all, Fordham wants their students to succeed, and the MSCY program is proof of this.

I had a wonderful experience in the cybersecurity master’s program at Fordham! This program is unique in how hands-on it is, and the breadth of electives offered allows students to customize their degree program to explore different career paths within cybersecurity. Most professors work in the industry doing what they teach, so hearing about their experiences adds a very engaging element to our courses. My favorite courses included Red Teaming, Penetration Testing, and Intrusion Detection and Network Forensics. I was president of the cybersecurity club during my last semester, and we had lots of great events to foster a community among the cybersecurity students with networking, workshops, and social events! This program has helped me make so many connections with other students, professors, and alumni and has helped me expand my professional network and meet some wonderful people.
