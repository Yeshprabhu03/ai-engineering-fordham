# Bioinformatics Minor

Bioinformatics is an emerging interdisciplinary field that studies the sequence, structure, and function of genes and proteins in living organisms. Bioinformatics requires knowledge and techniques from many disciplines, including biology and computer science. When dealing with an influx of raw information, significant amount of effort is spent on how to effectively and efficiently warehouse and access these data, and on new methods and algorithms aimed at mining this warehoused data in order to make novel discoveries in biology, medicine, and pharmaceuticals. Some examples of the topics are: genomics, proteomics, phylogenetics, functional genomics, algorithm and data analysis, microarray and gene expression, genomic medicine, biomarkers for cancer and disease, drug discovery and design for disease and disorders, database and data mining, network form and function, and ESL (ethical, societal, and legal) issues.

Because of the nature of the bioinformatics minor and the need to take courses in biology, chemistry, and computer science, this minor is geared toward students who will major in one of the following sciences: biology, general science, natural science, computer science, or information science. The minor generally requires a student to take an additional six courses (beyond their major). It is recommended that students declare a minor in bioinformatics early in their Fordham studies (ideally in the sophomore year).

The Bioinformatics minor is available to students at both Fordham College of Rose Hill and Fordham College at Lincoln Center. If you are interested in a minor in Bioinformatics, please contact [Dr. Ruhul Amin](https://ruhulsbu.github.io/), mamin17 ( at ) fordham.edu.

The basic curriculum for the minor is listed below. Please note that the minor generally requires only six courses (five for General Science majors) even though more than six courses are listed below. The reason is that many of the courses below can be counted as a requirement or elective toward one of the above majors. When you declare your minor, we will provide you with the list of courses you must take beyond your major.
