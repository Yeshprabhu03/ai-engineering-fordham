# Cybersecurity Minor

This minor offers comprehensive integration of problem-solving skills with rigorous theoretical background in the expanding field of cybersecurity. It provides valuable perspective for students coming from a variety of majors such as computer science, mathematics, physics or even economics, business and biology.

The Cyersecurity minor is available to students at both Fordham College at Rose Hill and Fordham College at Lincoln Center. Please contact [Dr. Thaier Hayajneh](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/departments/computer-and-information-science/faculty-and-administration/thaier-hayajneh/) for information.

Note: Students majoring in information science (IS) or information technology and systems (ITS) may not minor in cybersecurity because these majors already include most of the required courses.
