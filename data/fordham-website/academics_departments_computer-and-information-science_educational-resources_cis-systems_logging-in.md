# Logging In

There are two main servers for the Department: `storm`

located at the Rose Hill campus and `erdos`

at the Lincoln Center campus. Students needing to use a computer for their coursework are given an account on one or the other of these machines. An account on one of them is not valid on the other. Each machine can be accessed from any computer on the Internet. Especially fast access is available from the Department's computer laboratories at either campus. These laboratories are located in Room JMH 302 at Rose Hill and Room LL 612 at Lincoln Center.

You can connect to the Department's servers in three main ways: by a direct
[Linux login](/academics/departments/computer-and-information-science/educational-resources/cis-systems/logging-in/direct-linux-login/) in the computer lab in Room LL 612, by a
[remote desktop connection](/academics/departments/computer-and-information-science/educational-resources/cis-systems/logging-in/access-from-internet/remote-desktop-connection/), or by a
[Secure Shell connection](/academics/departments/computer-and-information-science/educational-resources/cis-systems/logging-in/access-from-internet/). The latter two methods can be used from any computer that is connected to the Internet, such as your personal computer.
