# Logging Out

Before logging out, make sure that you have saved all your work. To log out, simply click the *System* menu at the left of the taskbar, and select *Log out*.

**Important:** It is not sufficient simply to turn off the monitor or close all applications when you are finished working on the Unix host. You must log out using the above procedure.
