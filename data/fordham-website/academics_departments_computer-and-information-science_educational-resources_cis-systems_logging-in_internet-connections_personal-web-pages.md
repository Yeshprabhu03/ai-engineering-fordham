# Personal Web Pages

With your Unix account, you automatically have a World-Wide-Web URL. All you need to do is to create a web page to correspond to it, and you are on the Web! For your convenience, we have installed a script that will create a starter home page for you. Simply give the command `makehomepage`

and it will set up the necessary `public_html`

directory. You can use the Kompozer web page editor that is installed on the lab machines to create a home page file (which you should name `index.html`

) and other files to create your personal web space.

Once you have done this, anyone can visit your personal web page by going to one of the following URL's:` http://www.cis.fordham.edu/~username `

where username is your login name. The first form is for users with accounts on *or* http://www.dsm.fordham.edu/~username`storm`

, and the second for users with accounts on `erdos`

.
