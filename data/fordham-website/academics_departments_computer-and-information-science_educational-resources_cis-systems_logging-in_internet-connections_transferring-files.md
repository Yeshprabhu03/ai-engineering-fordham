# Transferring Files

Here are some detailed instructions for transferring files between your home computer and your Unix account. In the examples, it will be assumed that the Unix account is on `storm.cis.fordham.edu`

. Other users substitute the (fully domain-qualified) name of the machine where your account is located.

First, a word about terminology. The computer where you are working (e.g. your home computer) is called the* local host*, and the computer to or from which you want to transfer files (e.g. `storm.cis.fordham.edu`

) is called the *remote host*. Transferring files from the local host to the remote host is an *upload* operation, whereas transferring from the remote host to the local host is a *download*.
