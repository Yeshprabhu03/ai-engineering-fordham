# Office Software

We have installed OpenOfficeTM, an open-source application that combines a word processor, spreadsheet, presentation creator, drawing tool, and web browser. It is compatible with Microsoft WordTM, ExcelTM, and PowerPointTM.

OpenOffice is also available for Macintoshes and for Windows, so you can install it at home. Visit [http://www.openoffice.org/](http://www.openoffice.org/) for more information and to download it.

Most users will find that OpenOffice is fully integrated into their desktop environments, via the *Applications* menu. You can also start OpenOffice from a shell by typing the command `ooffice`
