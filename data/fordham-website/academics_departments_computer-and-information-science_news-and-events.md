### Intellectual Property Security: Challenges and New Frontiers

**By**: Sheikh Ariful IslamTime: Tuesday, March. 24 at 10 a.m. Eastern Time (US and Canada)

[Join the Zoom meeting for "Intellectual Property Security: Challenges and New Frontiers"](https://fordham.zoom.us/j/705380856)**Abstract**: The emergence of billions, smart, connected, and deeply embedded devices has led to Cyber-Physical System (CPS). The complexity of CPS has opened new opportunities for malicious attacks. The current globalized and decentralized Integrated Circuit (IC) business model faces several security challenges including overbuilding, counterfeiting, piracy, and hardware trojan. The existing protection mechanisms against Intellectual Property theft face several challenges in terms of performance overhead and are more vulnerable to side-channel attacks. In this talk, we will first discuss the major security issues of hardware protection. We will then describe the role of High-Level Synthesis (HLS) for hardware obfuscation early-on during the design cycle. Further, we will discuss DLockout, which locks out the design when finite, but incorrect trials are made from which recovery is only possible by legal authorities. We will then present camouflaging to increase the difficulty of reverse engineering followed by the resistance of proposed techniques against side-channel attacks. The novelty of proposed approaches is that we are free from storing the key bit in memory. The HLS-based Register Transfer Level (RTL) obfuscation technique which is application-agnostic results in the area, delay, and power overhead of 2.45%, 2.65%, and 2.61% respectively for a 32-bit key.**Bio**: Sheikh Ariful Islam received his B.Sc. degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Khulna University of Engineering and Technology, Bangladesh, in 2011. From 2011 to 2013, he worked as a full-time faculty in Northern University Bangladesh. Currently, he is working towards Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of South Florida, Tampa, FL. His current research focuses on the development of security-driven hardware synthesis tools and cyber-physical systems. He completed an internship at ON Semiconductor, Idaho in Fall 2018.

## Large-Scale and Robust Software Authorship Identification with Deep Feature Learning

**By**: Mohammed Abuhamad**Time**: Mon. Mar 23, 2020, 9:10 a.m. Eastern Time (US and Canada)[Join the Zoom Meeting for Large-Scale and Robust Software Authorship Identification with Deep Feature Learning](https://fordham.zoom.us/j/631463371)**Meeting ID**: 631 463 371**Abstract**: Software authorship identification is the process of software developer identification by associating a programmer to a given code based on the programmer's distinctive stylometric features. The software can be presented with the original source code or the executable binaries, which can be decompiled to generate pseudo-code as higher-level construction of the binary instructions. Successful software authorship de-anonymization has both software forensics applications and privacy implications. However, the process requires an efficient extraction of authorship attributes. The extraction of such attributes is very challenging, due to various software code formats from executable binaries with different toolchain provenance to source code with different programming languages. Moreover, the quality of attributes is bounded by the availability of software samples to a certain number of samples per author and a specific size for software samples. To this end, this work proposes a deep Learning-based approach for software authorship attribution, that facilitates large-scale, format-independent, language oblivious, and obfuscation-resilient software authorship identification. The proposed approach incorporates the process of learning deep authorship attribution using a recurrent neural network, and ensemble random forest classifier to de-anonymize programmers. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed approach over the entire Google Code Jam (GCJ) dataset across all years (from 2008 to 2016) and over real-world code samples from 1987 public repositories on GitHub. The results of our work show high accuracy despite requiring a smaller number of samples per author.**Bio**: Mohammed Abuhamad is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Central Florida (UCF), and a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Engineering at INHA University. He received his Master's degree in Information Technology (Artificial Intelligence) from the Faculty of Information Science and Technology, National University of Malaysia. Mohammed Abuhamad is a member of the Security Analytics Research Lab at UCF, and the Information Security Research Lab at INHA. His research interests include software security, authentication, privacy, and deep learning-based applications to information security.

### Spring 2020 CIS Seminar Series

The answer is: the holodeck, an immersive virtual reality facility capable of shaping dynamic stories around the live actions of human participants. This talk presents the history and future of automated interactive narrative with a focus on the scientific and engineering challenges that stand between us and a narrative controller fit for the holodeck.**Bio**: Dr. Justus Robertson received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from North Carolina State University where he studied video games, symbolic planning, cognitive psychology, and their applications to interactive storytelling. He is currently a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Theatre, Film, Television and Interactive Media at the University of York where he is researching data-driven storytelling in applied real-world domains, like eSports.

### Neuroimaging for Mental Disorders Research

**Speaker**: Xiaofu He Assistant Professor, Columbia University Medical Center**Date**: Wednesday, March 4**Location**: JMH 302**Abstract**: Mental disorders are common throughout the United States, affecting an estimated nearly one in five U.S. adults. Mental disorders are the leading cause of disability in the U.S. which greatly influences Americans lives. Although the latest neuroimaging techniques can be used to study brain structure and function, mental disorders are still not yet objectively diagnosed by neuroimaging. Moreover, the mechanism of cause-and-effect relationships between the human brain and behavior for mental disorders is still unknown. In this talk, I will discuss how we can use neuroimaging techniques (focus on Diffusion Tensor Imaging and fMRI) to identify brain biomarkers for mental disorders and how we can use real-time fMRI neurofeedback to investigate the cause-and-effect relationships between brain and behavior which can be applied to psychiatric disorders.**Bio**: Dr. Xiaofu He, Assistant Professor of Clinical Neurobiology at Columbia University Medical Center and a Research Scientist at New York State Psychiatric Institute. He is also a Faculty member at the Data Science Institute, Columbia University. Dr. He has a broad background in computer science, machine learning, neuroscience, and brain imaging. His research interests include developing brain imaging data analysis tools, exploring new diagnosis and prediction methods using machine learning including deep learning, and investigating potential treatments using real-time fMRI/fNIRS/EEG neurofeedback, which he is currently applying to psychiatric disorders.

### Invited Talk in Cybersecurity


By: Mohamed Rahouti**Tuesday, March 3 at JMH 302****Title**: A Dynamic Threshold-Based Modular Framework for SYN Flood Attack Detection and Mitigation Using SDN**Abstract**: Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and in particular, SYN flood attacks (half-open attacks) have been proven a serious threat to Software-Defined Networking (SDN)-enabled environments. A variety of Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) have been introduced for identifying and preventing such security threats, but they often result in significant performance overhead and response time. In addition to this shortcoming, previously proposed solutions are based on a static detection threshold that needs to be manually set prior to deployment. Therefore, those existing solutions are inflexible for at-scale networks as the malicious traffic rate may continuously change over time.As the centralized control capability of SDN presents a unique opportunity for enhancing Quality of Service (QoS) and security in networks, in this talk, I will present a novel and dynamic threshold-based kernel-level intrusion detection and prevention system to address these challenges through leveraging SDN capabilities and filtering mechanisms. The proposed solution is based on a self-adjusted detection threshold that aligns with the legitimate and malicious traffic rates in order to guarantee an efficient response to threats with optimal delay.

**Bio**: Mohamed Rahouti received an M.S. degree in Statistics in 2016 at the University of South Florida and is currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering at the University of South Florida. Mohamed holds numerous academic achievements in the area of computer science and engineering. His current research focuses on computer networking, Software-Defined Networking (SDN), and network security with applications to smart cities.

## The Geometry of Functional Spaces of Neural Networks

**Speaker**: Matthew Trager Post-doc Researcher, New York University**Date**: Wednesday, Feb. 26**Location**: LL 601**Abstract:**The reasons behind the empirical success of neural networks are not well understood. One important characteristic of modern deep learning architectures compared to other large-scale parametric learning models is that they identify a class of functions that is non-linear, but rather has a complex hierarchical structure. Furthermore, neural networks are non-identifiable models, in the sense that different parameters may yield the same function. Both of these aspects come into play significantly when optimizing an empirical risk in classification or regression tasks.In this talk, I will present some of my recent work that studies the functional space associated with neural networks with linear, polynomial, and ReLU activations, using ideas from algebraic and differential geometry. In particular, I will emphasize the distinction between the intrinsic function space and its parameterization, in order to shed light on the impact of the architecture on the expressivity of a model and the corresponding optimization landscapes.

**Bio**: Matthew Trager is a post-doc at the Center for Data Science at New York University. He has a Master’s degree in mathematics from the University of Pisa and Scuola Normale Superiore, and a "Master 2" degree in Mathematics, Machine Learning and Computer Vision from École Normale Supérieure de Cachan. He completed his PhD in computer science at École Normale Supérieure of Paris, under the supervision of Jean Ponce and Martial Hebert. During his PhD, he worked on the geometry of vision. He is now interested in mathematical aspects of deep learning.

### Understanding security threats with data-driven and human-centered approaches

By Doowon Kim

**Tuesday, February 25 at JMH 302****Abstract**: Recent cyberattacks involve various actors including diverse adversaries, where each actor plays subtle but prominent roles. It is essential to understand the real-world actors from various aspects to mitigate security threats and protect end-users from the threats. In this talk, I will present fundamental findings from several measurements and user studies exploring and understanding the unique behaviors of adversaries as well as benign software developers that cause various security incidents. First, I will discuss the malicious actor, adversaries: particularly, how they abuse the Code-Signing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) by exploiting the weaknesses in other actors (i.e., certificate authorities, publishers, and end-users). Second, I will describe why benign software developers often fail in secure development and present blueprints for improvement. Finally, I will conclude by discussing my future research directions in understanding new security threats and actors from emerging technologies (e.g., IoT).**Bio**: Doowon Kim is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park. His research focuses on data-driven security and usable security. Specifically, he investigates the root causes of security threats by better understanding actors (e.g., adversary and end-users) involved, with data-driven and human-centered perspectives. Moreover, his work covers the Code-Signing PKI, the Web PKI, and the security behaviors of benign software developers. His research has resulted in a real-world impact on the Code-Signing PKI and has generated interest from media such as Ars Technica, The Register, Schneier on Security, and Threatpost. He is a recipient of the NSA Best Scientific Cybersecurity Paper Award and Ann G. Wylie Dissertation Fellowship.

### Built-in Security and Resilience for Assured Autonomy: A Unified Game, Decision, and AI Approach

By Juntao Chen


Thursday, Feb. 20 at JMH 342**Abstract**: Mobile autonomous systems (MAS) are increasingly important due to their wide application in mission-critical tasks, such as surveillance, search, and rescue. Enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, multiple heterogeneous MAS can also be integrated together as a multi-layer MAS network to offer holistic services. On one hand, the networked MAS can improve the interoperability between different systems. On the other hand, it creates new challenges for enhancing the real-time security and resiliency of autonomy at different scales against cyber-physical attacks. To achieve assured autonomy, I will first establish universal metanetwork modeling which offers a gestalt view of heterogeneous autonomous components, and by leveraging which we can analyze the performance of the global MAS. Then, I will discuss metagame-theoretic approaches to enable decentralized and interdependent decision making between different operators under adversarial attacks. I will also provide AI-enabled algorithms for the online implementation of policies that yield a high level of autonomy in a dynamic environment.

Monday, October 1, 2018 | 1 p.m.

Bepler Commons | Faber Hall

Rose Hill CampusIn this year marking the 480th anniversary of the birth of Christopher Clavius, S.J., it seems appropriate for this lecture series, named in his honor, to focus on his life and legacy. That legacy ranges from the Gregorian calendar, which is the calendar that we all use today, to the Stanley Kubrick film 2001: A Space Odyssey. It ranges from popular textbooks to worldwide curricular reform. And it ranges from the history of science in China to the Vatican Observatory, which Pope Gregory XIII established in 1580 to help confirm and refine astronomical observations made in support of Clavius’ reform of the Gregorian calendar. Paul Mueller, S.J., who serves as vice director of the modern-day Vatican Observatory, will explore Clavius’ life and work in their early-modern context and illuminate his enduring legacy for modern science, religion, and culture.
