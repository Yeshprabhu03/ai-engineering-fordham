## Dance Innovation with The Ailey School

For more than 25 years, The Ailey School and Fordham University have been partners in an innovative Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) program in dance performance. Located blocks away from New York City's Lincoln Center for the Performance Arts, the four-year BFA curriculum combines the artistic pre-eminence of the official school of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater with a rigorous liberal arts education rooted in the Jesuit tradition of academic excellence.
