**The 2026 Ailey/Fordham BFA in Dance Benefit Concert**

Every spring, undergraduate BFA students present a special performance for donors, family, and friends of the Ailey/Fordham BFA in Dance program. The evening begins with a reception, followed by the performance.

The 2026 performance will pay tribute to Ana Marie Forsythe, Ailey Horton chair emerita of The Ailey School, celebrating her extraordinary dedication to teaching. Mrs. Forsythe is the former director of the Ailey/Fordham BFA in Dance program at The Ailey School and served as the chair of the Ailey Horton department from 1979 to 2025. In 2023, she was named the Dance Teacher Magazine Awardee of Distinction.
