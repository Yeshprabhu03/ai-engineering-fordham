# About the Economics Department

## What is Economics?

Economics is the study of how individuals, businesses, and governments choose to allocate resources to best satisfy their needs and objectives. The discipline draws from history, political science, philosophy, and mathematics to examine a wide range of topics, such as :

- Public debates about economic policy such as taxation, government expenditure, trade, and globalization
- The trade-offs and dynamics between unemployment and inflation
- How markets function, and what are the factors that influence interest rate setting and stock pricing
- The development and growth of the economy, health, and welfare

## Benefits of Studying Economics

The field offers students a clear and concise way of thinking about the ordinary business of life as well as preparation for a wide array of professional careers. Indeed, the demand for economics majors is strong in the private sector and government, and growing. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects employment growth of [14 percent for economists from 2019 to 2029](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/economists.htm). Not only is it excellent preparation for careers in business, non-profits, finance, and government organizations, but it also serves as a stepping stone towards graduate study in business, law, public policy, and economics.

## Learning Outcomes
