The Center for International Policy Studies (CIPS) facilitates research on international development from a multidisciplinary perspective, with linkages across Fordham schools. Through partnerships with academia, governments, nongovernmental and international organizations, and businesses, the Center participates in an international research network that shares knowledge about the impact of economic, social, political and legal policies on development at the household, community, and national levels with the goal of increasing interest, and designing and implementing models to improve development.
