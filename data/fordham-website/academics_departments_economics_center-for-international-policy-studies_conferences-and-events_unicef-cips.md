## Eyes on the Budget Project: Bringing the Public Back into Public Finance

UNICEF and Fordham University, with the support of the European Commission, hosted a policy forum on 18-19 February 2010 in New York City. The February 18th session was at Fordham Lincoln Center followed by a policy workshop at UNICEF the next day.

After the Global Financial Crisis governments face the challenge of protecting social spending with limited fiscal resources. This is especially true in developing countries who must also cope with volatile food prices. To protect children, women and poor families, governments must take decisive steps to both support economic recovery while protecting vital health and education programs.

Recovery with a human face requires adequate resources be channeled to effective programs targeting children, women and poor families. This conference will focus on three main policy areas:

- Ensuring budget transparency and citizen participation and engagement in order to ensure that enough resources are allocated and these are effectively channeled;
- Implementing robust counter cyclical social spending programs in response to crises and to support social services and minimize harm to children;
- Building and financing child-sensitive social protection systems that address both longer term structural poverty as well as crisis-response.

This meeting brought together development practitioners, researchers and other experts to discuss emerging empirical evidence and deliberate on key policy responses, notably those related to social budgets and public finance policy.
