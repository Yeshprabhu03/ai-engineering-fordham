# DiasporaLink

DiasporaLink is a research network of 32 universities and research institutes representing EU, the Americas, Africa, and Australia. It investigates, evaluates, and facilitates transnational diaspora entrepreneurship, TDE, as a driver of development and wealth creation in countries of origin and residence. DiasporaLink roles include the provision of IT-support, competence building, cross-border financing, and international research for transnational diaspora entrepreneurs.


As a part of its commitment to DiasporaLink, the Center for International Policy Studies (CIPS) at Fordham University has conducted research and held conferences in support of transnational entrepreneurs as a vital engine for development. Specifically, the CIPS’ Migration and Development Unit has organized an Immigrant Heritage Week workshop. At the workshop, professors Concepción Maiztegui of the University of Deusto, Bilbao, Spain and Shahamak Rezaei of Roskilde University, Denmark presented their work on issues such as
migrant social organizations and education among migrants. Immigrant organizations such as Coalicion Mexicana, NYC ID cards, [Spesnova](http://www.spesnova.org/), and Transnational Diasporas (TDEs) were also present at the conference.
