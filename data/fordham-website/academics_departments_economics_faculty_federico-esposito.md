Dr. Esposito is an economist with an interest in the economic implications of globalization and in the role of uncertainty for the propagation of economic shocks along global supply chains. In his work, he combines empirical evidence from a variety of data sources with quantitative economic models. His current projects study the interaction between trade, fiscal policies and climate change.
