Dr. Hrishikesh (Rick) D. Vinod is a professor of Economics and director of the Institute for Ethics and Economic Policy at Fordham University in New York. Rick won the IBM fellowship at Harvard University, where he earned his Ph.D. Among his many awards, he is a Fellow of the Journal of Econometrics.

Rick has received the Bene Merenti Award for 40 years of service at Fordham University with exceptional scholarship. He has published more than 160 research papers in journals such as Econometrica, the Journal of Econometrics, the Journal of the American Statistical Association, The Review of Economics and Statistics, and the American Economic Review, among many others. He has co-edited several volumes of the Handbook of Statistics and authored several textbooks.

Rick has accumulated approximately 6,000 citations, with an outstanding h-index of 38 (January 2022). He was the first to solve the optimal clustering problems with integer programming and use inventory theoretic demand analysis. Rick’s early work on ridge regression was recognized in Significance magazine (published by the American Statistical Association and the Royal Statistical Society of the UK in 2020) for its impact on data science. More recently, he has pioneered a maximum entropy bootstrap method for time series, and new tools for causality assessment.
