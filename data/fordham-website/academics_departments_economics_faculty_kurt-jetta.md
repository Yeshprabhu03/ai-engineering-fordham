Dr. Kurt Jetta is the CEO and Founder of TABS Group, Inc., and retail and consumer analytics firm that he founded in 1998. He is on the Board of Directors and is the Chairman of the Audit Committee of JM Global Holdings (NASDAQ: WYIGU), a public company with the objective of acquiring consumer products brands. He is the Co-founder and the Director of the Research Unit for the Economics of Consumer Marketing.

Dr. Jetta received his Ph.D. in Economics from Fordham University in May 2008, where he specialized in Consumer Demand Theory. His Doctoral Thesis was titled “A Theory of Retailer Price Promotion Using Economic Foundations: It’s All Incremental.” In this paper he used economic theories to explain why incremental sales generated from retailer price promotions showed no evidence of sourcing from other brands, future weeks or other retailers; it is a complete category expansion effect. In this work Dr. Jetta also identified the general deficiency of academic work in the marketing discipline to employ the basics of consumer demand theory to bolster their research.

Dr. Jetta presented his doctoral thesis at the Marketing Science Conference in Istanbul, Turkey in July 2013. He co-authored the paper “A Model to Improve the Estimation of Baseline Sales” in the Journal Centrum Cathedra with Dr. Erick Rengifo, and the two currently have a Working Paper as the same name as his dissertation.

Dr. Jetta has an MBA from Duke University, Fuqua School of Business (’86) and a BS in Statistics from North Carolina State University (’83).
