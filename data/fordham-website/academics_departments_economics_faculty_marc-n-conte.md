Dr. Conte's primary research interests relate to the provision of environmental public goods. He uses research techniques from applied microeconomics and experimental economics to explore the outcomes of voluntary and governmental programs aimed at increasing the provision of environmental public goods. He has explored such programs in the context of carbon offsets, charitable giving to conservation organizations, green energy programs, and payments for ecosystem services. Dr. Conte is quite interested in land-use decisions, and while at the Natural Capital Project at Stanford University, he led projects focused on this issue for the Department of Defense, the State Legislature of Hawai'i, and provincial governments in Sumatra.
