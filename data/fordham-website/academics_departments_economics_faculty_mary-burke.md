Dr. Burke currently is a lecturer in the Economics Department for Fordham University. Undergraduate classes taught include Statistics, Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, Math for Economists, Money and Banking, and Monetary Policy. At the graduate level she teaches Economic Analysis and Domestic and International Banking. In the Fall 2004, Dr. Burke developed and offered a seminar course for freshmen in microeconomics. The seminar course encourages student writing as a part of the presentation of the microeconomic material. In the Fall 2008, Dr. Burke developed a course in Monetary Policy designed around the Federal Reserve Bank’s Fed Challenge. This course covers the financial industry, the central bank and its role in the economy, and the application of monetary policy tools both traditional and non-traditional. The students are required to conduct an economic analysis of the current US economy with a view towards the appropriate monetary policy prescriptions. The class of five to seven teams is required to present these analyses both in class and in the Economics Department and then follow with a term paper for the semester. Starting in the Fall 2010, Dr. Burke has planned a Fordham Economics Challenge with the teams from the Monetary Policy class. Several teams of students have competed for an Economics Prize. At the same time, Dr. Burke serves as the Associate Chair of the Economics Department for Undergraduates.
