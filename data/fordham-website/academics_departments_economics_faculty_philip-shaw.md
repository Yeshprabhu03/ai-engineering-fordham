Dr. Shaw's research focuses on educational corruption, nonparametric econometrics, computational methods for economics and finance, and economic growth. Currently Dr. Shaw is looking at instrumental variable estimation of functions when the unknown function to be estimated is only additively separable with respect to unobservables. His research also looks into the impact educational corruption has on economic growth, the college wage premium, and educational attainment rates in a theoretical framework. Dr. Shaw is also in the process of developing nonparametric computational methods that aid in the solution of stochastic general equilibrium models when the joint determination of covariates is completely unknown.
