Dr. Collins is a Professor of Economics at Fordham University. In his research, he applies laboratory-based experimental methods to provide new insights into long-standing questions surrounding markets, microstructure, and decision-making under uncertainty. His work has posed a reconciliation of the classic “preference reversal” problem (Collins and James, 2015), offered an explanation for classic empirical market entry game results (Collins, James, Servátka, and Woods, 2017), expanded and refined a classic approach to understanding mispricing in financial markets (Collins and Brink, 2016), and made use of isomorphisms between new risk-elicitation procedures and auctions to decompose and isolate the effect of spatial representation (Collins and James, 2024). He teaches courses in microeconomics, financial economics, and ethics.
