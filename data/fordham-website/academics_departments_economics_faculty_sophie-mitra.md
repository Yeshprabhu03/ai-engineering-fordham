Sophie Mitra is professor of economics, founding co-director of the Community and Global Public Health minor, founding director of the Research Consortium on Disability at Fordham University in New York City and principal investigator of the

[Disability Data Initiative](https://disabilitydata.ace.fordham.edu/). Her research agenda has documented economic insecurity and evaluated policies that try to reduce it. A central line of work consists in producing evidence to document disability inequalities through disaggregated statistics and to understand the factors that drive them, such as discrimination or extra costs of living for families (e.g. medical or transportation costs). She is the author of[Disability, Health and Human Development](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781137536372)(Palgrave MacMillan, 2018), in which she proposed the human development model disability, health and wellbeing based on the capability approach. She received her doctorate in economics from Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne. Sophie Mitra is a fellow of the Human Development and Capability Association, an IZA fellow and an elected member of the National Academic of Social Insurance. -
