# Economics Graduate Studies

The Department of Economics at Fordham offers [M.A.](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/gsas/economics/ma/), [Ph.D.](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/gsas/economics/phd/), [Dual M.A./M.S.](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/gsas/economics/dual-degree-economics-and-data-science/), and [M.S.](/academics/departments/economics/graduate-studies/master-of-science-in-data-science-and-quantitative-economics/) degree programs. Our widely published faculty teach small class sections and provide individualized, personal mentorship to all graduate students.

We offer concentrations in development, international, financial, and monetary economics. There are also a variety of elective courses to choose from, including game theory, programming, economic history, health economics, and more. Our M.A. students take a preparatory course in mathematics, as well as either financial or applied econometrics.

Our students graduate with a core of knowledge and analytic skills and are highly desirable job candidates.

## M.A. Program

Fordham's Economics Master's program prepares our students for a variety of careers, including investment banking and transfer pricing. Many go on to work at top accounting or legal firms, with non-profit organizations, or city, state, or federal government agencies.

## Ph.D. Program

Ph.D. students take our advanced mathematics course plus three courses in econometrics, both theory and applied. We also offer a distinctive, one-semester teaching practicum, which prepares students to become effective instructors. We hold yearly workshops for our Ph.D. students to perfect their presentations skills and we have courses designed to teach dissertation writing and research methods. We also have a detailed job market preparation guide and twice-yearly meetings for our students to prepare them for the job market.

- In the last 8 years, approximately 2/3 of our Ph.D. students take jobs in research positions.
- About 62% of those are placed at academic institutions within one year of graduation.
- The remaining third of our students find jobs in the private sector domestically as well as internationally.

## Dual M.A./M.S. Program

The dual degree in economics (M.A.) and data science (M.S.) enables students to gain a deeper understanding of economic theory and computational methods while having the time and expertise to engage in research projects that link data science and economics.

## M.S. Program

Fordham’s M.S. in data science and quantitative economics, offered through both the Economics and Computer and Information Science departments, addresses this urgent need by offering a distinct, interdisciplinary graduate program that will enable students to develop a deeper understanding of economic theory and computational methods.
