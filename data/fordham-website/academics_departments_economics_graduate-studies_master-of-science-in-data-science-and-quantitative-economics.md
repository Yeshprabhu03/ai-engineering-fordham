In today’s dynamic job market, employers increasingly seek candidates with a diverse skill set that integrates data analysis and economic expertise. Proficiency in traditional economic tools, statistical methods, and cutting-edge data science techniques is highly valued across a wide range of sectors and industries - from finance and health policy to economics development and family/disability studies.

Fordham’s M.S. in data science and quantitative economics, offered through both the Economics and Computer and Information Science departments, addresses this urgent need by offering a distinct, interdisciplinary graduate program that will enable students to develop a deeper understanding of economic theory and computational methods.

Our students will gain a competitive edge through our comprehensive analytical training, which combines theoretical approaches with hands-on experience using state-of-the-art tools. This will equip graduates with the ability to tackle complex data problems with confidence and professionalism, giving them a clear advantage in today's data-driven world.

Students who pursue this degree will take 10 courses (for a total of 30 credits) essential to both economic and data science domains, which can be taken sequentially or concurrently as needed.
