## ECON 5700 Mathemathical Methods in Economics I

All incoming Ph.D. students are required to attend ECON 5700 Mathemathical Methods in Economics I (formerly Math Camp) in August before the start of the fall semester. Other incoming graduate students are welcome to attend, but not required to. We offer ECON 5710 Math for Economists I during the regular fall semester which covers similar material.

Mathemathical Methods in Economics I is typically three weeks long (four days per week) and is held in August just before the start of the fall semester.

### Course Objective

- Provide incoming graduate students with the mathematical foundations necessary for the first-year sequence of theory and econometric courses.

### Course Guidelines

- Your success in our program depends on how comfortable you are with the needed mathematical tools.
- The course is designed assuming students will have already been exposed to the majority of this material in previous studies.
- The scope of the material to be covered is much larger than one would encounter in an ordinary mathematics course.
