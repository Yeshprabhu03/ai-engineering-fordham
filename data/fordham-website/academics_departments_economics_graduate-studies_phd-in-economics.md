# Ph.D. in Economics

Whether you’re looking to engage in innovative academic research or provide economic leadership in government and business, Fordham’s Ph.D. program in economics will give you the specialized training you need to make a direct impact on the world.

You’ll work closely with our renowned faculty members, whose expertise extends to the classroom and the boardroom at the highest levels—and whose publishing credits include the best-selling textbook on international economics in the world. You’ll gain a broad knowledge of economic theory and quantitative methods while specializing in one of four tracks:

**Development Economics**focuses on evaluating economic policy, analyzing country risk, and assessing human development programs.**Financial Economics**emphasizes portfolio selection, risk management, asset pricing, financial markets, and corporate finance.**International Economics**provides the economic and analytical tools to address business and public policy problems that arise through foreign trade, investment, development assistance, and capital flows.**Monetary Economics**centers on monetary theory—including inflation targeting and price-setting behavior—and exposes students to dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models and vector autoregression techniques.

## Stem Designation

Fordham now designates the Ph.D. in Economics with the STEM CIP code of "Econometrics and Quantitative Economics." This more accurately reflects the quantitative and analytic focus of our academic programs, and allows our international students with valid F1 visas to request a two-year extension for OPT (as an addition to the standard one year). Please consult Fordham’s [STEM Extension](/academics/academic-resources/international-services/students/post-graduation/stem-extension/) page for more information.
