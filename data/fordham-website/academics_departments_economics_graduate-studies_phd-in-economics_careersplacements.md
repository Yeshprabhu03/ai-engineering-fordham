# Ph.D. in Economics Careers/Placements

We rigorously prepare our Ph.D candidates for the academic and non-academic job market. The job market preparation is coordinated by the Graduate Director.

- Starting in the spring semester prior to entering the job market, our Ph.D. students participate in an information session on the job market process.
- They are then guided by their mentors to prepare a well-rounded application package during spring and throughout summer.
- In the fall semester, the Graduate Director sets up mock interviews and job talks for our job market candidates. These are attended by both faculty members and fellow graduate students.
- Students will be advised throughout the job market process by the Graduate Director and the members of the candidate's dissertation committee.

**Our graduates have gone on to careers in academia and as financial analysts, economists, and executives in several fields:**

- Academic (international and domestic)
- Central Banks
- European Commission, Joint Committee on Taxation (US)
- Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, FINRA, US Trust
- Multinational business
- Non-governmental organizations (World Bank and UN)
- International banking
- International public administration and government
