**Seminar Title:*** Legislating Longevity: State-Level Public Health Laws and the Mortality Transition *

**Abstract:*** *State legislators passed numerous public health laws during the twentieth century, most of which likely had negligible effects on mortality. Using data from the universe of state-level public health laws and regulations, this paper tests whether these laws collectively can account for a meaningful fraction of the mortality transition. To account for the endogeneity of public health laws, I instrument for public health laws using the legislative schedule, the length of legislative sessions, and legislator salaries. Both panel IV and OLS estimates suggest laws reduced mortality. A text analysis of the laws reveals that laws regarding housing/tenements, drug safety, and the collection of vital statistics are most associated with mortality declines.

**Seminar Title:** *Altruism and the Endowment Effect *

**Abstract:** Using random assignment in an online laboratory setting to different orderings of a sequence of charitable donation solicitations and a tangible item auction, we conduct a preregistered study of whether altruistic behavior plays a causal role in reducing the endowment effect. We use a social norming treatment and a framing treatment to exogenously stimulate giving, observing the effects on the WTA-WTP disparity in the subsequent auction. We also employ several construal level manipulation checks. Our experimental manipulations show that induced giving reduces the endowment effect. We also find robust evidence of a negative association between altruism and the endowment effect, consistent with prior work. The results provide a possible explanation for the survival of altruism in market contexts and offer potential insights for devising new policy solutions to address public goods problems.

**Seminar Title:** *Front-line Courts as State Capacity: Evidence from India *

**Abstract:*** *Front-line courts handle the bulk of legal cases and yet they are severely under-resourced, with potential implications for economic development. Using rich court-level panel data from India, constructed using the universe of legal case records, and an event study research design, I show that an increase in judge staffing levels substantially reduces case backlog in district courts, and subsequently improves the productivity of local formal sector firms. One of the key mechanisms driving these effects is the last mile enforcement of credit contracts, which enables banks to lend more to the industrial sector. Hiring district judges is highly cost-effective.

**Seminar Title:** Trust and Healthcare-Seeking Behavior

**Abstract:*** *We present results from a nationally representative survey of American adults, guided by a simple theoretical model expressing health care-seeking behavior as a function of economic and behavioral fundamentals and highlighting the pivotal role of trust. We establish several facts. First, we document a strong association between higher levels of trust and reported care-seeking behavior, both retrospective and anticipated. This relationship holds across several care scenarios, from routine check-ups to vaccinations. Second, the impact of trust on health care utilization is similar in magnitude to that of factors such as income and education, long recognized as crucial in the existing literature. Third, key mechanisms from our theoretical framework, notably individuals’ beliefs about the medical system's effectiveness in managing their health and their personal disutility tied to medical visits, present strong associations with individuals’ levels of trust. Additionally, our exploration into trust within various health care sectors reveals similar correlations with care-seeking behavior, notably highlighting the substantial influence of trust in the CDC particularly concerning flu vaccinations. Finally, we find no statistical difference in the relationship between trust and care-seeking for Black respondents, but we find important differences by age and political affiliation.

**Seminar Title:*** Learning and Efficiency in the Market for Physician Referrals *

**Abstract:*** *In many areas of care, primary care physicians (PCPs) greatly influence a patient's choice of specialist, but how well do PCPs learn about specialist quality, if at all? In this paper, we study PCP referrals to specialists, using the population of orthopedic procedures for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries from 2008 through 2018. We document substantial heterogeneity in specialist quality and cost within geographic markets, and we present design-based evidence that PCPs adjust their referrals specifically based on the outcomes of their own patients. We then employ a structural learning model to measure the effects of uncertainty in physician referrals and to simulate possible reallocations when there is better information about quality. We find that one-third of these patients would be referred to a different specialist in the absence of informational frictions, with small but meaningful improvements in patient quality of care.

**Seminar Title:*** Lies, Truths, and Perceptions: Misaligned Beliefs in Sender-Receiver Deception Games*

**Abstract:*** *Deception occurs across domains—from law enforcement to markets and social media. While experimental economics has advanced our understanding of why people lie (Abeler et al., 2019; Gneezy et al., 2018), far less is known about how individuals detect and respond to deception. Most work focuses on senders; we study receivers. Do receivers anticipate lies accurately? Do senders adapt to these beliefs We conducted a large online experiment (N≈2000) using modified die-roll and matrix tasks in an incentivized sender-receiver design. In Part 1, “senders” reported outcomes under two conditions: paid regardless of believability or paid only if believed. In Part 2, “receivers” judged these reports and wagered on accuracy We find systematic misalignments. In the die-roll task, receivers are overly skeptical of moderate values, ignoring that most lies are small. In the matrix task, they are not skeptical enough of high claims, which are often dishonest. Receivers also fail to adjust to senders’ incentives, while senders underuse strategically optimal “sweet spot” claims. Behavior departs from Bayesian predictions.

**Seminar Title: ***Evolution of institutional designs: endogenizing the history of allocation procedures for the Indian civil services *

**Abstract: **In India, the allocation of elite civil servants to a particular state matters for that state's development and growth. So, when, how, and why are the institutions governing the allocation of elite civil servants reformed? In this paper, I endogenize the evolution of allocation procedures used to assign Indian Administrative, Police, and Forest Service officers to states across India post-Independence. Using detailed knowledge of the history of matching mechanisms and the civil servants' rank-order preferences, I highlight the constant struggle over allocation procedures between the Prime Minister and the civil service. The Prime Minister wants a more equitable distribution of bureaucratic quality across the country for balanced growth and development. Whereas the civil service wants more weight to be given to their own preferences over where to work. The aspirations of the executive and the bureaucracy remain at odds with one another because bureaucrats' preferences are correlated: avoiding lifelong assignments to underdeveloped areas and conflict zones. I find that over time the institutional pendulum swings between allocation procedures the Prime Minister favors and those that the bureaucracy favors, depending on the strength of the Prime Minister. Strong Prime Ministers (proxied by majority governments) can resist pressure from the bureaucracy. Thereby, they institute allocation procedures that achieve a more equitable balance of bureaucratic quality across the country, albeit by giving bureaucrats’ preferences less weight or restricting their ability to express certain types of preferences. On the other hand, weak Prime Ministers (proxied by coalition governments) are more prone to the bureaucracy’s pressure. In turn, they institute allocation procedures that give most bureaucrats more preferred assignments, though this comes at the expense of disadvantaged regions systematically receiving lower-quality bureaucrats.

**Speaker: **[Ashutosh Thakur](https://sites.google.com/view/ashutoshthakur) (Assistant Professor, Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy NUS)

Ashutosh Thakur is an Assistant Professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at NUS. Ashutosh holds his Ph.D. from Stanford University's Graduate School of Business and A.B. Economics from Princeton University. His research applies tools of market design to political economy, with a focus on institutional stability and organizational productivity. For example, he studies mechanisms allocating elite civil servants to states in India and party-specific mechanisms for assigning politicians to committees in the US Senate. He develops tools and techniques in matching theory that can be used in these instances to better understand the problem (empirically and theoretically) and to design better mechanisms (an engineering perspective).

**Seminar Title:*** Does racial animus determine support for redistributive policies in the United States?*

**Abstract:*** *It has been hypothesized that support for redistributive policy in the United States is influenced by beliefs about beneficiaries’ racial composition. We report findings from two large parallel, three-stage information provision experiments that leverage the different racialized histories of welfare and unemployment insurance. We first explore the extent to which racial beliefs predict policy preferences and then test whether these beliefs can be persistently changed through an information intervention. We find that the untreated beliefs are more predictive of support for the racially stigmatized welfare program than for the less stigmatized unemployment insurance program, but also that participants who received information that there are more (less) Black recipients than expected supported welfare less (more). Along with various robustness tests and extensions, we also find that untreated beliefs are stable over time but that our intervention generates persistent changes. In short, we find robust evidence of a causal relationship between racial animus and redistributive policy preferences..

**Seminar Title:** *Nationalism on Online Games During War*

**Abstract:** We investigate how international conflicts impact the behavior of hostile nationals in online games. Utilizing data from the largest online chess platform, where players can see their opponents' country flags, we observed behavioral responses based on the opponents' nationality. Specifically, there is a notable decrease in the share of games played against hostile nationals, indicating a reluctance to engage. Additionally, players show different strategic adjustments: they opt for safer opening moves and exhibit higher persistence in games, evidenced by longer game durations and fewer resignations. This study provides unique insights into the impact of geopolitical conflicts on strategic interactions in an online setting, offering contributions to further understanding human behavior during international conflicts.

**Seminar Title:** *School Quality, Literacy, and the Differences in Fertility across Regions*

**Abstract:*** *Sub-Saharan Africa's fertility decline has progressed much slower than in other regions. Although many explanations have been advanced to explain this, there has so far been little focus on the potential role of differences in school quality. Partly motivated by the strong negative association between female education and fertility, many developing countries significantly expanded access to education starting in the 1970s. However, the quality of education often declined with the increased enrollment. This reduction in quality was especially severe for primary education, with Sub-Saharan Africa doing particularly badly. As a first step towards understanding the role of school quality on the relationship between female education and fertility, this paper examines whether the differential literacy skills acquired by grade levels across countries may help explain differences in fertility outcomes across regions. The data comes from all Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Unicef’s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) from countries in East Asia, South Asia, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, collected between 1986 and 2022. Using data from women across the four regions, I estimate individual-level fertility outcomes as a function of literacy measures, region, and cohort by area of residence.

**Seminar Title: ***Mentorship and the Gender Gap in Academia*

**Abstract: **This paper examines how the presence of female professors impacts graduates fromtop-50 U.S. economics PhD programs. Combining rich data on advisor-advisee relationships and career trajectories with a research design leveraging quasi-random sabbatical timing, we find gendered effects. The absence of a female professor decreases third-year female Ph.D. students' likelihood of publishing papers and securing academic positions. Conversely, male Ph.D. students in the same cohort benefit from this absence, seeing an increase in their publishing and placement prospects. These divergent outcomes can be explained by gender homophily in mentorship, with female students 51 percent more likely than male students to have a female advisor. One additional female senior professor in each top-50 economics department would close one-third of the gender gap in representation among assistant professors at top-25 schools.

**Speaker:** [Sahar Parsa](https://parsahar.github.io/) (Faculty, New York University).

Sahar Parsa an applied economist with interests in political economy and finance. Her research has investigated both the determinants of political and cultural institutions and the consequences of these institutions. Sahar's research interests have led her to a wide variety of settings, from economic history and politics to financial markets. She has also used a variety of methodologies to answer her research questions, with a focus on causal identification. As an applied econometrician, Sahar has used quasi-experimental methodologies, lab experiments, and more recently, machine learning methods in research. That said, the primary motivation behind her research lies not in the application of methods but in the questions, which concern the interaction between culture, politics, social attitudes, and economic outcomes.
