# Majors in Economics

We offer three different majors in our department: A
[major in Economics](/undergraduate-admission/majors-and-minors/economics/), a
[major in International Political Economy](/undergraduate-admission/majors-and-minors/international-political-economy/), and a
[major in Mathematics and Quantitative Economics](/academics/departments/mathematics-economics/).

Students majoring in economics can design a program of studies that will prepare them for graduate studies in economics, international affairs, public affairs, business, or law, or for directly entering the labor force.

Students who plan to work after graduation from Fordham College will find that many job recruiters are favorably impressed by students who have selected this challenging, liberal arts discipline.

Majors find careers in academics; corporate business, including retailing; financial and consulting services; and the public sector.
