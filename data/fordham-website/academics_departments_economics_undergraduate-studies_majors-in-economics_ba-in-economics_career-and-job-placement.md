# Career and Job Placement for Economic Students

*Career Paths*

Approximately 55% of economics graduates continue their education at some point in their lives; 21% attended law school, and 16% completed an MBA.

The "Alumni Directory: Undergraduate Program in Economics" is available from Prof. Burke, the associate chair, for students to peruse. There is also a folder that students may borrow that lists alumni willing to speak with students about career paths.

#### Financial Rewards

Economic majors in the U.S. do well financially. Data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics reveal that men, aged 35-44, with a bachelor's degree (any major) earned $43,199 on average in 1993. Similar men who majored in economics earned $49,377. Women aged 35-44 with a bachelor's degree earned $32,155 on average in 1993, while those who majored in economics earned $49,170. Economics is the only major in which there is gender equality in earnings in midlife.
