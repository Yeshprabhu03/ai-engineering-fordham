Premised on the belief that the study of literature and the practice of writing are mutually reinforcing pursuits, the Creative Writing Program emphasizes the inter-relations among creative writing, digital media, criticism, and scholarship. Our degree offerings include literature courses, small writing workshops, and practical industry training seminars to prepare you for advanced study or careers in writing, media, and publishing. In addition, you will benefit from the resources provided by a creatively accomplished [faculty](/academics/departments/english/creative-writing/creative-writing-faculty/) with distinguished publications and extensive knowledge of the institutions that support creative writing. You will also enjoy the opportunities afforded by New York City itself, a worldwide center for literary publishing and the arts. The study of creative writing offers both a practice and a foundational way of thinking that fosters empathy, resilience and joyful innovation. You will study a diversity of forms, genres and voices, and discover the ways in which language is a primary tool to realize not only a creative career, but also a creative life.
