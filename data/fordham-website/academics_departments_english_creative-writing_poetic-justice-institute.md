# Poetic Justice Institute

## Advancing American Poetry & Poetics

Poetic Justice Institute is a Fordham University community of poets, scholars, students, and social justice workers who explore the power of poetry to change the world for the better through acts of imagination and the energy of new languages and visions. Through print/digital technologies and big tent gatherings, we celebrate American poetry and poetics as indispensable tools for social and personal transformation.
