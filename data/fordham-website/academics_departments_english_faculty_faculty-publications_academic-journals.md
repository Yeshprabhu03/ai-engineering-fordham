# English Department Academic Journals

The creative and scholarly journals housed in Fordham's English Department are essential components of our vibrant intellectual environment while also adding to the department's visibility nationally and internationally. Fordham English faculty members edit these journals and serve on their advisory boards; the journals also provide opportunities for graduate assistantships to some of our doctoral students.
