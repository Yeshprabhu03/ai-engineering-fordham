Joyce Studies Annual

Dept. of English

Bronx, NY 10458

**Content**: The editors invite significant contributions on Joyce and closely related topics. In keeping with its founding tradition, *JSA* publishes essays of greater length and scope than are normally found in scholarly journals. While not limited to longer essays, it welcomes ambitious studies in the areas of textual, historical, theoretical and comparative analysis. We will consider essays up to 50 manuscript pages. *Joyce Studies Annual* is a refereed journal; all submissions are evaluated by selected members of the advisory board, as well as by the editors.

**Style**: Manuscripts must conform to the Chicago Manual of Style. Unless otherwise indicated, essays should refer the standard editions of Joyce's works listed below. References to these editions and to Ellmann's biography should be cited parenthetically within the body of the essay, using the abbreviations below. Quotations from Ulysses should be cited by episode and line number; quotations from *Finnegans Wake* should be cited by page and line number.
