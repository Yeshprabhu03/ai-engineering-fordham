[Kirk Quinsland](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#315a4044585f425d505f5571575e435559505c1f545544)'s research uses phenomenology, theater history, performance studies, new media studies, and digital humanities to study the early modern theatrical experience. He is working on a book that investigates medieval and early modern metatheatricality, as well as articles on Shakespeare's*Venus and Adonis*and*A Midsummer Night's Dream*that explore the utility and the limits of queer theory as an analytical framework. He is also the creator of[Digital Blackfriars](https://web.archive.org/web/20210730105153/http://digitalblackfriars.org/), a digital humanities project that maps the Loseley Collection (1489-1682), a set of documents currently held by the Folger Shakespeare Library concerning the Offices of the Tents and of the Revels, to investigate the connections between site and text in plays written for London's Blackfriars Theatre.
