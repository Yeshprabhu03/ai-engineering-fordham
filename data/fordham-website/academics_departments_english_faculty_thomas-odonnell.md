His current book project,*The Theoretical Life*, explores the connections between writing, community life, memory, and prayer in English monasteries between 1000 and 1250, and he publishes frequently on the related topics of multilingualism and geographic networks in the Middle Ages. While Dr. O’Donnell’s research focuses on writing in Old and Middle English, Latin, and Old French, his courses cover works from medieval Wales, Ireland, and Occitania, as well.
