# English PhD Comprehensive Exam

**Timeframe**

PhD students will take the oral portion of the Comprehensive Exam at the end of their second year in the program, either in May or in late August.

In May, the Exam will take place on the designated Reading Day, as indicated on the FCRH academic calendar. In late August, it will take place on one of two Exam Days, the two non-holiday weekdays before the first day of fall semester classes.

The May Exam is strongly recommended as it allows students to begin developing their dissertation proposals during the summer before they begin teaching.

**Format**

The PhD Comprehensive Exam consists of two components:

- A revised course essay
- A two-hour oral exam covering one major field and two minor fields

**Exam Committee**

The PhD Comprehensive Exam Committee will usually consist of three English department faculty members, one of whom serves as the Committee Chair. In consultation with the DGS, the student will select their Committee Chair. The DGS and Committee Chair assist in selecting two additional Committee Members; students may opt to add a fourth examiner, with DGS and Committee Chair approval.

Committees must be finalized during the Fall semester prior to the May or August exam date.

**Exam Results**

GSAS grades include Pass, High Pass, and Failure. All grades require the agreement of at least three of the four examiners.

A Pass grade requires the oral and written expression of a sound conceptual grasp of literary history and form, as well as evidence of a solid familiarity with the individual works discussed. Successful students are able to respond productively to questions and argue points with clarity and specificity, while demonstrating competent knowledge of their major and minor fields.

A High Pass grade requires a higher order of synthetic understanding, historical range, original insight, theoretical sophistication, and detailed recollection. In assigning a High Pass, Exam Committees look for evidence of serious and sustained independent thinking.

Students who fail the exam may retake it once, within six months of the first attempt. The first failure does not appear on a student's transcript. Students may read faculty comments on their exams after submitting a written request to the graduate administrator.

Students whose Exam is only marginally passable but not indicative of the ability to complete a dissertation will receive a departmental grade of Low Pass. Because this grade is officially recorded as a Pass, it allows for a student to receive the MPhil degree. But students receiving a Low Pass will not be allowed to continue work toward the PhD
