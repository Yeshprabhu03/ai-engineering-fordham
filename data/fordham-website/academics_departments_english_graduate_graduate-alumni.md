Lost and Found: Wayfinding in Early American Literature

**Dissertation Description**

My dissertation explores the relationship between human identity and navigation (wayfinding), from the time of the colonists to the publication of Henry David’s Thoreau’s landmark *Walden *in 1854. Examining narratives of colonial women travelers, shipwrecked sailors, frontiersmen, fugitive slaves, and surveyors, my dissertation argues that getting lost privileges a sense of selfhood that relies upon the autonomy of nature, rather than the mastery of it.

Ecologies of the Novel: The British novel in Caribbean narratives

**Dissertation Description**

My dissertation explores the ways in which conventions of the novel - things like the picaresque, the sentimental, and the gothic - make their way into mid and late eighteenth-century Caribbean travel narratives and journals. These conventions allow Caribbean texts to challenge the social conventions of plantation society and offer a different view of the Caribbean, one in which slaves are featured as individuals with agency and one in which the boundaries between humans and animals begin to blur.

Knightly Male Bodies and Violence in Middle English Romance

**Dissertation Description**

Steven's dissertation explores the social significance of developed male bodies in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and argues that representations of knightly physicality in late medieval England are the vehicle for expressing anxieties about militarized bodies. His study begins with an analysis of two popular didactic texts, Knyghthode and Battaile and Secreta Secretorum, before closely analyzing three Middle English romances: the anonymous Sir Gowther, Chaucer's Knight's Tale, and Malory's Morte D'Arthure, in order to understand how and why that body and identity could register as both desirable and frightening to medieval audiences.

The Shape of History: Formal Variety and the Production of the Past in Twelfth-Century History Writing in England and Normandy (ca. 1120-1154)

**Dissertation Description**

My dissertation examines formal variety -- the appearance of different forms, styles, and registers -- in four twelfth-century chronicles written in England and Normandy. It is a multilingual dissertation; of the chronicles I research, two are Latin, one Old English, and one Old French. In it, I argue that historians in the twelfth century conceptualized history as intergeneric in nature and used diverse literary forms in order to claim truth or authority in different and multiple ways.

Occupying War: U.S. Militarism and Representing War since 1989

Her dissertation traces a cultural history of post-Cold War American militarism, specifically post-conscription professionalization and the rise of occupation-style warfare. Examining war literature and films alongside government documents, military records, and news media, She argues that the practices, logics, and aesthetics of contemporary militarism have made it increasingly difficult for American civilians to apprehend war and those who fight.

My dissertation examines the use of medical discourses in Pre- and Post-Reformation penitential writings – personal meditations, allegorical narratives, sermons, poems – in order to elucidate how devout people in both periods used reading as a means of reforming body and soul. This project gives special attention to under-used archival sources that bear witness to individual penitential reading practices.

The Self-Made Woman in American Literature, 1820-1880

**Dissertation Description**

The period from 1820-1880 witnessed the rising popularity of the self-made man in America as a culturally and nationally significant type in both literature and daily life. At the same time, the nation's culture also bred a burgeoning women's rights movement and its popular literature was dominated by female voices. This project looks at the points of contact and of friction between these various movements to consider the presence and significance of the discourses of self-making and success primarily in writing by and/or about American women.

Dispossessed Women: Female Homelessness in Romantic Literature

**Dissertation Description**

This work examines the real-life reception and literary representation of female vagrants at a point in history when females out numbered men two to one in terms of homelessness. The project surveys various genres to examine how vagrant women were treated by authors as the tides of vagrant populations continued to rise after a century of famine, war, and displacement due to enclosure and industrialization. The project begins with Mary Robinson’s lyric response to Wordsworth’s “The Female Vagrant”—a point of problematic sympathy for the homeless female—and ends with Robert Southey’s nasty treatment of the vagrant woman who originally invaded the cottage in “The Story of the Three Bears.”

Immersive Reading: Dreamers and Their Books in Late Medieval England

**Dissertation Description**

Johnstone's dissertation examines the groundswell of interest in dreams and visions between the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries in England, arguing that the multivalent realm of dreaming offered readers renewed and sometimes controversial ways of approaching their everyday lives. Her chapters span the diverse materials of dream interpretation guides, literary dream visions, apocalypse manuscripts and illustrations, and the medium of stained glass in an effort to get closer to an understanding of what dreaming meant to medieval people.

Conceptualizing the Inconceivable in Anglo-Saxon Wisdom Texts

**Dissertation Description**

His dissertation, tentatively titled "Conceptualizing the Inconceivable in Anglo-Saxon Wisdom Texts," focuses on the effect of language and of cultural history on Christian subjectivity in Anglo-Saxon England. This project explores what it meant to an Anglo-Saxon in the century following the Alfredian Renaissance to self-identify as a Christian by examining the ways that Old English adaptations of Latin Christian philosophical and theological texts differ conceptually from the originals. David hopes, with this project, to challenge the monolithic definition of "Christian" that informs much of the modern scholarship on early medieval English Christianity.

Subaqueous Poetics: Exploring Oceanic Depths in Modern and Contemporary Poetry

**Dissertation Description**

My dissertation explores thematic relationships among twentieth and twenty-first century poetic texts that invoke the oceanic depths in ways that cross linguistic, temporal, and spatial borders. Drawing on the ocean as an expansive metaphor for alterity and difference, poets such as H.D. and M. NourbeSe Phillip have constructed an aquatic other space that challenges hegemonic narratives of the ocean. Work related to my dissertation can be found in *Atlantic Studies* and various poetry venues.

Citizen Technologies: The U.S. Post Office and the Transformation of Early American Literature

**Dissertation Description**

At the heart of my dissertation is the premise that the U.S. Post Office Department--the nation’s first comprehensive social network and informational infrastructure--gave early Americans a way to understand national union. Not only did this early systematization of communication have a profound impact on textual circulation, but I argue that contemporary authors used representations of the postal system to negotiate the problems and promises of national union within their works. Each chapter draws upon the postal archive to argue for a range of intersections between the mail and the book. Building on recent work in print culture and temporality studies, my project draws out the geographical and temporal specifics of early American mail delivery, and theorizes how these underexamined material factors might differently orient scholars toward the study of early American literature.

The Poetics of Exploratory Ductus

**Dissertation Description**

In "The Poetics of Exploratory Ductus," I explore how monks, nuns, and other religious wrote texts that had the potential to undermine religious orthopraxis. My work focuses on the ways medieval religious appropriated secular literary modes from pagan classical authors. I look at both less well-known texts –– the Latin poems of Abbot Baudri of Bourgueil and the verse history of the First Crusade composed by Gilo of Paris –– and the Exeter Book of Old English poetry, which contains well-known poems like “The Wanderer,” “The Seafarer,” and “The Wife’s Lament.” I show how poetry served as a place for exploratory play apparently indifferent to religious goals, though often serving to accomplish those goals in roundabout, unconventional, and surprising ways.

Pastoral Education in England and Its Impact on Fifteenth-Century Literary Culture

**Dissertation Description**

My dissertation focuses on how female and middle-class audiences engaged with texts of religious instruction in fifteenth-century England. I examine how these texts gave such readers spiritual and political authority, allowing them to share the Church’s role of teaching the faith and giving them more universal, Christian definitions of the political virtues of prudence and justice that made these virtues relevant to a wider audience than the ruling class.

Religious Enthusiasm and the British Worker, from Henry Fielding to George Eliot

**Dissertation Description**

Her dissertation views the novel through the lens of major philosophical debates, such as revelation versus reason and faith versus works. Essentially, Judith treats the rising novel as a spiritual space for self-definition, both from the perspective of a servant, such as Fielding’s Joseph Andrews, or an artisan, such as Eliot’s Adam Bede, during a time when religion, though central, offered an increasingly confusing proliferation of philosophical world views.
