*Graduate English Students Convening at One of GEA's Many Socials*

The [Graduate English Association](https://fordhamgea.wordpress.com/) (GEA) is a student-run group that hosts various social and academic events for English graduate students. Featuring a board ofthree to four graduate students, the GEA works to fulfill three core objectives: first, to enhance Fordham English graduate students’ academic and professional experiences; second, to provide graduate students a network of support; and third, to represent graduate students’ interests and concerns.

To improve graduate students’ academic and professional experiences, the GEA has held such events as:

- The annual Student–Faculty Roundtable, at which graduate students and faculty present papers that interact with one another. The event allows student participants to collaborate with professors from the department and then share their research with an audience of peers and faculty.
- Semi-annual Town Hall Events with the Director of Graduate Studies that allow students to ask questions, voice any concerns, and learn about new initiatives and opportunities.
- Workshops in professionalization, such as faculty-and-student-led informational sessions about CV construction, interview practices, tactics for grant applications, possible academic and Alt-Ac career paths, and much more.
- Informational sessions about research practices and degree progress.

To foster a collegial atmosphere within the graduate-student community, the GEA also holds monthly a variety of social events in the New York City area.

Lastly, to represent graduate students’ needs, members of the GEA board attend faculty departmental meetings, where they voice any graduate student concerns as well as record notes for all graduate students in the department.
