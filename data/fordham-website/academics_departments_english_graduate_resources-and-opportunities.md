# English Department Resources and Opportunities

## Resources

**Director of Graduate Studies (DGS)**

Graduate students are encouraged to meet the DGS during office hours or by appointment. The DGS also runs the Issues in Academia course each fall. [Andrew Albin](/academics/departments/english/faculty/andrew-albin/) is the DGS.

**Director of Placement and Professional Development (DPPD)**

The DPPD also runs the Dissertation Workshop in the fall. [Maria Farland](/academics/departments/english/faculty/maria-farland/) is the DPPD.

**Faculty Advisers**

Each student is assigned a faculty adviser with whom to consult on questions about succeeding in coursework, developing intellectual breadth and/or specialized expertise, improving writing or bibliographical skills, compiling reading lists in particular fields and sub-fields, giving conference papers and publishing, and pursuing other kinds of professional activity.

**Orientation**

Each year, before classes begin, we provide a comprehensive orientation designed to make the transition into the University as smooth as possible. The morning presentation is by GSAS, followed by lunch, then the English–specific orientation is held, followed by the President's Reception.

**GSAS Cornell School of Criticism and Theory Award**

Each year, GSAS will provide funding for one PhD student in English to attend the Cornell School of Criticism and Theory (SCT). The award covers tuition and also provides a small stipend for living expenses (in the recent past, awards have totaled $4000). To receive the award, students should contact the DGS and express interest in being considered at least one month before the deadline to apply for the SCT. If students receive the GSAS award, they must then submit a full application directly to the SCT by the SCT’s deadline (usually Feb 1; see the [SCT’s website](http://sct.cornell.edu/) for more information about the deadline and the application process).** GSAS Santander International Internships Fellowship**

The Santander International Internships Fellowships provide support for graduate students who wish to spend the summer working with an international non-governmental organization (NGO). The amount of the award varies, depending on the details of the proposal. Students who have completed at least one semester of full-time graduate study (9 credits) in GSAS by the time the fellowship begins are eligible to apply. The deadline is usually in April.

[GSAS Student Achievements](http://form.jotformpro.com/form/51536299086970)

We celebrate the scholarly achievements of our graduate students. ** Via this survey, **students submit their achievements (publications, conference presentations, awards, etc.) for acknowledgement and for listing in the annual report.

** Inter-University Doctoral Consortium**

The Doctoral Consortium is a program that gives Fordham PhD students who have completed one year of study an opportunity to register for courses at select regional universities, including Columbia, Princeton, NYU, CUNY, and Rutgers.

[Rhētorikós](https://rhetorikos.blog.fordham.edu/)

Graduate students in English serve on the editorial board of this online journal that publishes the most outstanding student writing composed in Fordham University’s core writing classes, Composition I and II. Published once each fall and spring semester, the journal provides undergraduate students with the experience of preparing prose for publication and the prestige of publishing writing early in their academic careers. This project promotes the Ignatian concept of eloquentia perfecta, or the ability to make clear, rhetorically persuasive, sound arguments, by encouraging students to achieve excellence in the art of writing.
