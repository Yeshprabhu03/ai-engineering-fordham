### Museum Internships

An internship at one of New York City’s many museums is a unique and rewarding experience that can complement academic coursework. In addition to preparing students for potential future careers at museums or cultural institutions, an internship can also help students develop valuable skills in research, administration, and teaching in a non-traditional setting.

Fordham can assist you in applying for an internship at the

[Metropolitan Museum of Art](https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/internships/undergraduate-and-graduate-students), the[Rubin Museum of Art](https://rubinmuseum.org/about/jobs), the[Museum of the City of New York](https://www.mcny.org/employment), the[Merchant’s House Museum](https://merchantshouse.org/support/volunteer/), the[New-York Historical Society](https://www.nyhistory.org/careers/internships), and[Historic House museums](https://historichousetrust.org/employment-opportunities/), among others.

This year-long Fellowship is designed for advanced PhD candidates who are interested in exploring careers in higher education leadership. It offers opportunities to engage with strategic initiatives in graduate education within the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and across the University. Fellows spearhead or advance strategic initiatives aimed at improving the graduate school experience on behalf of their peers in the GSAS student community. They benefit from rigorous, collegial mentoring while shadowing a senior member of the GSAS administration and work with many members of the GSAS staff, including the Dean. Fellows gain an insider's perspective on how a graduate school operates and contribute to the school's daily functions and long-term vision. Each Fellow's role is tailored to match the interests and skills of the Fellow with current GSAS initiatives.

Past Fellows have helped launch GSAS Futures, develop the Preparing Future Faculty (PFF) program, coordinate the inaugural dissertation/thesis boot camp, support Fordham's Middle States reaccreditation activities, and develop the new GSAS strategic plan under the Continuous University Strategic Planning (CUSP) framework.

The Fellowship offers a stipend and requires 8-10 hours per week. It can be held concurrently with a Teaching Fellowship, so long as these dual commitments can be successfully balanced and do not impact a Fellow’s additional academic and professional goals and responsibilities.

**Qualifications**: Applicants must be enrolled/matriculated as a full-time student in a GSAS PhD program, be in good academic standing, and have completed all required course work by the end of the spring 2020 semester. Successful applicants typically have completed their comprehensive exams and are in years 4-6 of their PhD programs.**Application**: Calls for application usually come in the fall term and ask applicants to submit a cover letter and resume/CV by email. Candidates advance through a two-round interview process with the search committee and GSAS Dean.
