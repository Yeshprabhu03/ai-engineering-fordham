A select group of students are invited to join AXO each year on the basis of exceptional academic achievement. Other interested students may apply if they meet [Sigma Tau Delta’s membership criteria](https://english.org/join-us/about-membership/). Applicants will be asked to attest to their eligibility for membership, provide contact information for a faculty reference, submit a brief personal statement, and identify any student leadership opportunities they would be interested in pursuing if admitted to AXO.

If you would like to apply to join AXO, please fill out [this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSejTf9fNJbtPGf7IvUXcBqMwQHxFSKa3CseKbS2U5sB_lZ9FA/viewform). Accepted students will be asked to pay a one-time induction fee of $45 to Sigma Tau Delta, as well as a one-time chapter fee of $20 to Alpha Chi Omicron. If you are accepted to AXO, you will receive information on how to submit payment when you receive your acceptance letter.

The application period opens on December 1 and closes on the first day of the spring semester each year. Applications are reviewed first by AXO’s Faculty Supervisors, then by the tenured and tenure-track English faculty as a whole. Decisions are usually given by mid-February.
