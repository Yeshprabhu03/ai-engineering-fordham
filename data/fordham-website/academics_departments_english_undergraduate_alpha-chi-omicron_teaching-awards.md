## AXO Teaching Awards

Founded in 2021, the AXO Teaching Awards are designed to recognize outstanding teaching that combats racism and promotes social justice. Based on student input collected and reviewed by a committee headed by AXO student leaders, the awards are divided into three categories:

- Outstanding Teaching in Composition
- Outstanding Teaching in Texts and Contexts
- Outstanding Teaching in Upper-Division Electives

Each category features two winners, as well as a list of honorable mentions. Funding for the inaugural round of awards was generously provided by Fordham’s Chief Diversity Officer, the Writing Program, and the English department.

More information on the awardees for 2020-21 is available at [Fordham English News](http://fordhamenglish.com/news1/2021/10/6/alpha-chi-omicron-teaching-award-winners-announced).
