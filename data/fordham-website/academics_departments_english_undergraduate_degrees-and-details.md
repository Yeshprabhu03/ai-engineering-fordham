# English Undergraduate: Degrees and Details

-
The study of English is for anyone who wants to understand literature and all forms of texts and media. No discipline better prepares its students to understand diverse cultural forms, to craft persuasive arguments, and to write lucidly and beautifully. The range of electives and seminars that make up the bulk of the curriculum allows for flexibility in designing individualized paths through the major, while also giving students a comprehensive grasp of the varieties of literature and literary study.

Premised on the belief that the study of literature and the practice of writing are mutually reinforcing, the English Major with a Creative Writing Concentration emphasizes the inter-relations among creative writing, digital media, criticism, and scholarship. As a concentration with a dual focus on literature and creative work, fully integrated within the English department, this degree offering combines literature courses, small writing workshops, and practical industry training to prepare students for advanced study or careers in writing, media, and publishing. In addition, our concentrators benefit from the resources provided by a creatively accomplished faculty whose work is distinguished and whose practical knowledge of the institutions that support creative writing is extensive, and New York City itself, a worldwide center for literary publishing.

Applications for the Creative Writing Minor are accepted throughout the school year.

The Public & Professional Writing (PPW) minor is designed for students who write extensively in their public, civic, and professional lives. It is designed for English majors who wish to hone their prose-writing skills, and for students from any major who foresee futures in communication-centric fields, including media, public policy, international relations, business, social work, law, medicine, and more. It also appeals to students with interests in nonprofit, advocacy, and activist work.

Don’t let lack of experience hold you back after graduation. 20% of graduating seniors with jobs received these jobs through internships. Internships provide hands-on experience and can help to steer you on the path to a successful career choice.

## Receiving Academic Credit for Internships

The University has two requirements for receiving academic credit for internships:

- You must have a minimum of 60 completed academic credits
- You must have a minimum 3.0 GPA


## English Department Stipulations on Internships

In order to receive academic credit for an internship, you must register for a tutorial with a faculty member who agrees to serve as academic advisor. That tutorial will combine the internship with additional academic work. Depending on the amount of academic work involved in the tutorial, your faculty mentor will suggest that you register for a one- or two- credit internship. Internship tutorials do not count for credit toward the English major, the English major with a creative writing concentration, the English minor, or the Creative Writing minor, though they do count as general credits toward graduation. They are graded on a pass/fail basis.

We expect employers to abide by the standards for “

[Internship Programs Under the Fair Labor Standards Act](http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs71.htm).” Please familiarize yourself with these standards and regulations.

## Tips for Success

Conduct your own research and networking. Whom do you know? What connections do you have? Fall and Spring semester internships are less competitive than summer internships. Big magazines like Cosmopolitan don't always fill all their slots for the Spring. Browse through sites and respond to jobs for which you qualify and apply for some that might be a stretch.

### How do I get credit for courses I took elsewhere?

The official transcript from the other institution needs to be sent to your class dean. Once the course shows up on your MyFordham transcript, you can take or send the catalogue description (syllabus is better) to the Associate Chair who can tell your class dean whether or not it can count toward the major (you can go first to the Associate Chair with a description to find out if the course will count before you sign up for it). Bring a copy of the Cognate course form for the Associate Chair to sign. You can access this form here. You are restricted to two cognate courses during your course of study in English.

### Can I take a course elsewhere in the summer and have it count for my major?

Take the catalogue description of the course to the Associate Chair at your campus for approval before enrolling in the course. You must make sure that the course applies to the major and does not duplicate work you have already completed. Bring a copy of the Cognate course form for the Associate Chair to sign. You can access this form here. You are restricted to two cognate courses during your course of study in English.

-
Before you go on Study Abroad, meet with your Associate Chair to discuss the classes you are planning to take when you are abroad. If these classes change once you arrive you can inform him or her through email. For an English major you can get two approved for credit toward the major and one towards the minor.

After you return, make sure your transcripts are sent to the ISAP office. The registrar posts these grades as transfer credit. Make sure that your courses are placed in the proper allotment for Degree Works. If they are not, please contact your Associate Chair. Notify us which courses should be allotted to the major and the semester in which you took them. We will report this information to the registrar and make sure that they are properly credited.
