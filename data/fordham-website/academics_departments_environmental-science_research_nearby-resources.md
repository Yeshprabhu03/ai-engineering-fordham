## The New York Botanical Garden (NYBG)

The NYBG includes 250 acres of formal gardens, conservatories, deciduous forest, and research and educational facilities, located directly across Southern (Kazimiroff) Blvd. from Fordham’s main gate. It maintains one of the world’s largest collections of living plants, and one of the largest herbaria in the world (>7 million plant and fungi specimens). It is the region’s leading educational center for gardening and horticulture. The NYBG is a world leader in plant research, and combines traditional curatorial methods with cutting-edge molecular systematics technologies to examine global botanical biodiversity, ethnobotany, and conservation. The NYBG maintains a substantial botanical library, and offers a diversity of botanical classes to students and the general public.

## The Bronx Zoo

The Bronx Zoo is located diagonally across Fordham Road from Fordham’s Rose Hill campus and is the flagship zoological park of the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). Its 265 acres house more than 6,000 animals, including some of nature's rarest species, including Asian elephants, Chinese alligators and snow leopards. Keepers and scientists of the WCS conduct conservation, animal husbandry, behavioral, and nutritional studies on animals in natural settings. Other WCS staff scientists also manage and conduct a huge field research program aimed at conserving animal diversity world wide. Several Fordham Biology Masters and PhD graduates are staff members at the WCS, and other WCS staff members serve as adjunct biology faculty at Fordham.

## The American Museum of Natural History (AMNH)

The AMNH is a multi-disciplinary scientific research and education institution with specializations in anthropology, astronomy, geology, paleontology, and zoology. The AMNH is located on the upper west side of Manhattan and can be reached by Fordham students using mass transit. Their collections and exhibits include more than 32 million specimens and artifacts in 25 interconnected buildings that house 46 permanent exhibition halls, research laboratories, and research library. The AMNH is a major center for scientific research in the fields listed above and also runs the Center for Biodiversity and Conservation, which integrates scientific research, education, and outreach. A Fordham faculty member in the Department of Chemistry currently holds a Research Associate appointment at the AMNH and students have utilized the instrumentation and specimens for several research projects.
