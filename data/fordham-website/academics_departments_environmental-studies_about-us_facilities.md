# Environmental Studies Facilities

At the [Calder Center Biological Field Station](/about/campuses/the-louis-calder-center/), a 114-acre expanse of forest, lakes, and wetlands in nearby Armonk, NY, you can take ecology classes and conduct field research alongside a selected number of biologists who focus on water management and conservation for government and industry.

At the [Center for Urban Ecology](/academics/departments/biological-sciences/facilities-and-research-centers/center-for-urban-ecology/), you can study the intersection of nature and the city with scientists researching the impact of urbanization on regional ecosystems and the role people play in physiological, ecological, and evolutionary processes.

At [St. Rose’s Garden](http://fordhamsustainability.wordpress.com/st-roses-garden/), an urban organic agricultural project and outdoor classroom on the Rose Hill campus, you can do practicum course work and internships in partnership with the [New York Botanical Garden’s Edible Academy](http://www.nybg.org/education/edible-academy/).

At [St. Rose's Community Supported Agriculture](http://fordhamsustainability.wordpress.com/st-roses-csa/), which weekly brings food to the Rose Hill Campus from local organic farmers, you can complete practicum course work and gain valuable professional experience.

The [Campus Sustainability Program](/about/sustainability-at-fordham/), a Fordham-wide initiative to minimize our environmental impact and pursue best practices in sustainability, provides another opportunity to complete practicum requirements in courses. The program partners with NYC government’s sustainability plan [PlaNYC](http://www.nyc.gov/html/planyc2030/html/home/home.shtml).

Fordham’s formal partnerships with the New York Botanical Garden, the Wildlife Conservation Society at the Bronx Zoo, the [Bronx River Alliance](http://www.bronxriver.org/), and the [Environmental Consortium of Colleges and Universities](http://www.environmentalconsortium.org/ec.html) provide access to renowned facilities and internship opportunities in New York City, one of the most vibrant centers of environmental education and urban ecology in the world.
