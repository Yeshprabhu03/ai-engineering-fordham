# Environmental Studies Major and Minor

Whether you major or minor in environmental studies, you will undertake broad interdisciplinary course work involving the natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, and applied disciplines such as design, business, and law.

## Discover Environmental Justice

Environmental justice is one of the concepts treated in the Environmental Studies program. You can develop a fuller understanding of the environmental justice movement by completing the six-course minor in [Peace and Justice Studies](/academics/departments/peace-and-justice-studies/), using the following environmental justice courses to fulfill the four required electives (courses can be double counted with the Environmental Studies major or minor), and fulfilling the Experiential Learning requirement with service work in the environmental justice field.

In addition, you would complete the Peace and Justice introductory course and capstone course. For advising, contact Prof. John van Buren, Director of Environmental Studies and Peace and Justice Studies at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#553023343b372027303b15333a27313d34387b303120).
