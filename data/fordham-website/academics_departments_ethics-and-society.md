## At the Forefront of Moral Debate Integrity in Action

From bioethics to business, from the courtroom to the classroom, the need for ethical decision-making has never been greater. Whether online or in-person, our Master's Degree Program in [Ethics and Society](/academics/departments/ethics-and-society/about/) in the [Center for Ethics Education](/academics/centers-and-institutes/center-for-ethics-education/) will provide you with the tools for critical and compassionate engagement with the most pressing ethical issues. During these unprecedented times, our courses address issues of current ethical import including the fight for racial justice and equality.

Both academically rigorous and practical, our cross-disciplinary MA program is grounded in the Jesuit tradition of intellectual excellence—enriched through moral values, religious concerns, and a commitment to creating a caring and just world. You will gain a foundation in the moral frameworks of philosophy, theology, psychology, bioethics, and social justice while observing professionals whose work requires ethical decision-making.
