# Santander Scholarship Recipient Testimonials

“Attending the workshop allowed me to explore a diversity of ethical views and perspectives. It was great to be able to discuss projects and practical examples outside of my day to day practice and sector, and then to consider how these scenarios might apply in my own public health study and work in rural and regional Australia. I’ve already found it useful to reframe professional discussions to explicitly address ethical issues. I’m also in the process of writing a publication directly drawing from the learnings of the workshop. The Faculty who delivered the workshop were engaging, thoughtful and challenging, the topics were interesting and my fellow students brought their own wealth of insights, disciplinary perspectives and animated discussion. I feel privileged to have been a 2015 Santander Universities/Fordham Ethics and Society Scholarship Recipient.” *Danielle Couch (Australia)*, 2015 Santander Universities/ Fordham Ethics and Society Scholarship Recipient


“The Ethics and Society course at Fordham University was an intellectually stimulating and fantastic experience. Each segment covered topical issues which were used to challenge the students to think critically about the crucial relevance of applied ethics. I particularly enjoyed meeting fellow scholars from all over the world, and exchanging our ideas and diverse experiences to bear on the issues. It is not everyday you get to discuss and debate a series of fascinating ethical issues with a panel of six experts! The approachable demeanor of the Fordham University staff made the course even more enjoyable. Thank you Santander Universities for allowing me this unforgettable experience!" *Tory Hibbitt *(U.K.), 2015 Santander Universities/ Fordham Ethics and Society Scholarship Recipient

“For an aspiring academic such as myself, the scholarship allowed me to meet experts and other scholars in different fields who are also concerned about ethics and society. I was able to learn from and about other fields aside from my own, which in turn deepened my understanding of my own discipline, and became the foundation of research that I was able to bring back to the Philippines for my students and fellow faculty to also learn from and use in our courses and studies.” *Stephanie Puen (Philippines)*, 2015 Santander Universities/Fordham Ethics and Society Scholarship Recipient

"The Santander Scholarship was a unique opportunity to participate in the Workshop Theories and Applications in Contemporary Ethics. To spend one week at Fordham University and to prepare reaction papers gave me the chance to plunge into the philosophical and ethical discussions in America. Without doubt, the program has a lasting impression on my academic history and deepened my enthusiasm for practical philosophy. During the workshop, I had the chance to prepare a paper on palliative care in Germany. In doing so, I could not just focus on ethical questions in my own country, but also bring them into discussion in an international auditory. This helped me enormous for further research in that area. I am very thankful for this program." *Stephan Hecht (Germany)*, 2014 Santander Universities/Fordham Ethics and Society Scholarship Recipient

“Being a clinical researcher, this training has opened up my eyes to issues related to participant recruitment for HIV/AIDS clinical trials research. The Santander Universities/Fordham Ethics and Society educational experience gave me the opportunity to be a member of an institutional ethics committee for human research in India and I was recently selected by the Federal Government of India to serve as a member of a new drug trial approval committee. This experience provided me with an opportunity to be involved in community engaged in clinical research, which has been a challenging and rewarding experience.” *Arun Talukdar (India)*, 2014 Santander Universities/Fordham Ethics and Society Scholarship Recipient

“Through the Santander Universities/Fordham Ethics and Society Scholarship, I was able to gain in depth knowledge about ethics (to which I hadn’t previously been exposed). This enabled me to play a pivotal role in young people's lives, by actively mobilizing them to take ownership of the problems they are faced with, and find solutions to these diverse problems.” *Charmaine Thokoane (South Africa)*, 2013 Santander Universities/Fordham Ethics and Society Scholarship Recipient
