**one year**on a full-time basis.**Part-time study**and**evening courses**are also available. Our 10-course (30 credit) curriculum, taught by Fordham’s world-class faculty, is highly interdisciplinary, integrating moral philosophy, theology, bioethics, professional ethics, and the ethical approaches of the social and natural sciences. Consistent with Fordham’s Jesuit intellectual tradition, this curriculum pairs cross-disciplinary graduate education in foundational ethical frameworks with practical and applied educational opportunities that directly confront pressing issues in ethics and social justice. While offering a breadth of ethical knowledge, this curriculum is also highly flexible: through our**personalized advising**, and optional thematic, students have the opportunity to tailor their education to further their personal academic interests and[areas of specialization](https://t4.fordham.edu/terminalfour/preview/2/en/14672).[career goals](https://t4.fordham.edu/terminalfour/preview/2/en/14663) -

**two required Cross-Disciplinary Ethics courses**, offered through the Center for Ethics Education.**CEED 5050: Ethics and Society: Cross-Disciplinary Perspectives**Our introductory course, Cross-Disciplinary Perspectives, provides students a broad, interdisciplinary foundation in ethical theory and practice. Students are introduced to important concepts, theories, methodologies, and applications from a variety of ethical traditions and disciplinary perspectives. This course features guest lectures from experts at Fordham and elsewhere representing moral philosophy, theology, social justice, bioethics, research ethics and ethics in science, professional and business ethics, ethics in law, and more.

**CEED 6100: Theories and Applications in Contemporary Ethics**[Theories and Applications](https://t4.fordham.edu/terminalfour/preview/2/en/14670)is a three-day intensive course that exemplifies our innovative approach to interdisciplinary ethics education. Over three days in May, this team-taught course brings together six instructors from different disciplines who engage in a collaborative and interactive examination of contemporary ethical issues, utilizing the methods of their individual disciplines to analyze the ethical and social dimensions of a given theme. Some of the recent themes include Identity; Boundaries: Individual, Cultural, and Global Challenges; and Conscience and Conscientious Practice. In recent years, faculty have represented African American Studies, Anthropology, American Studies, Biology, Cognitive and Clinical Psychology, Communication and Media Studies, Education, Law, Medicine, Neurophysics, Philosophy, Political Science, Sociology, and Theology.**Moral Philosophy**Students will take

**at least two courses in moral philosophy**offered through Fordham’s Department of Philosophy and the Center for Ethics Education. These philosophy offerings will deepen the student’s understanding of the theory, methodology, and history of moral philosophy, and will enable students to use these tools to examine issues of contemporary ethical and social import. Students can choose between courses like Normative Ethical Theory or Natural Law: The Nature, Foundations, and Content of Justice, which dive deeper into the dominant perspectives within philosophical moral theories; courses that focus on the thought of prominent historical figures, such as Aristotle, St. Thomas Aquinas, or St. Augustine; or courses that focus on specific issues in applied ethics, such as Confronting Moral Controversy, Bioethics Analysis of Clinical Case Studies, Environmental Philosophy and Ethics, or Special Topics in Ethics and Society.**Moral Theology**Students will take

**at least two courses in moral theology**offered through Fordham’s Department of Theology. These courses examine theological approaches to ethics rooted in scripture, tradition, reason, and experience, paying particular attention to Catholic Social Teaching and the rich diversity of Catholic Christian Theology. In the Jesuit tradition, these courses integrate theological analysis, a practical concern for concrete ethical and social issues, and an overarching commitment to promoting social justice. Some courses, such as Systematic Liberation Theology, Introduction to Theological Ethics, Biblical Ethics, Feminist Theology, Socially Engaged Theology, African American Theological Ethics, and Catholic Social Thought examine important theological approaches and perspectives. Other courses, such as Sexual Ethics, Christian Ecological Ethics, Ethics and Economics, Theology and Science, and Bioethics provide more thorough examination of specific areas of ethical concern.**Social & Natural Sciences**Students will complete

**at least two courses in the Social and Natural Sciences**. These courses examine how ethics should be integrated into scientific practice, while demonstrating how the tools, methods, and findings of the social and natural sciences can be brought to bear in identifying, analyzing, and addressing ethical questions and challenges. Demonstrating the importance of ethics to Fordham’s entire academic community, courses are available from a variety of graduate departments, including Psychology, Economics, Political Science, Biological Sciences, Communication and Media Studies, and Sociology. Course options include Health Disparities and Social Inequalities; Conservation Biology; Gender and Economic Development; Race, Gender, and Digital Media; Campaign Finance and Ethics; Ethics in Psychology; Psychology and Criminal Law; Issues in Urban Sociology; and Research Ethics and Social Justice, among many others.**Electives**Students will also complete

**at least two elective courses**. Students can choose to take additional courses in moral philosophy, theology, social and natural sciences, or cross-disciplinary ethics. Or, they can take a wide variety of courses from other departments or by other Fordham graduate colleges, such as US Immigration and Ethnicity (History), Integrating Human Rights and Justice in Practice (Graduate School of Social Service), Urban Health and Environment (Urban Studies), or Jurisprudence (College of Law).**Individual tutorials or independent study courses**can also be arranged as electives in areas of interest for which there might not be a specific course. Examples of individualized tutorials include “Business Ethics”, “Moral Instinct and Moral Behaviors,” “Religion, Gender, and Sexuality,” and “Race, Justice, and Policing.” Students also have the option to complete an individualized[practicum experience](https://t4.fordham.edu/terminalfour/preview/2/en/14668), pairing direct exposure to ethics work (such as shadowing an ethics professional or hands-on experiences working on an ethics and social justice project for a community organization) with academic work that contextualizes and analyzes the ethical dimensions of that work.
