# Master of Arts in Ethics and Society Practicum

Beyond traditional coursework, Ethics and Society Master’s students can gain hands-on, practical experience of ethics in action through a practicum in New York City (or elsewhere). Practicum experiences provide opportunities to observe and learn from the community about ethical decision-making in professional settings, to gain valuable work-related experience to advance existing or future careers, and to advance projects that have real-world social impact. Practicum experiences might include:

- shadowing hospital workers and clinical ethics consultants in local hospitals
- conducting communications and outreach work for a global bioethics non-profit organizations
- preparing and implementing lessons for middle or high school students on contemporary social justice issues
- working with foundations on ethical issues in philanthropy
- collaborating with IRB professionals in developing research ethics guidelines
- conducting ethics training in non-profit organizations

Qualifying students can be matched to one of Fordham's over 100 partner organizations around New York City through the guidance of Fordham's [Center for Community-Engaged Learning](/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/external-affairs/center-for-community-engaged-learning/). Partner organizations include: [Communities for Healing and Justice](https://chjharlem.org/), [Harlem River Working Group](https://harlemriverworkinggroup.org/), [Let's Get Ready!](https://www.letsgetready.org/) (Fordham Chapter), [Liberty Partnerships Program](https://libertypartnerships.com/) - Fordham, and [Peer Health Exchange](https://www.peerhealthexchange.org/) (Fordham Chapter). Students will work at the practicum site (on-site or virtually) once or twice per week (approximately 8 hours per week total), participating in observations, engaging in projects, and performing work as assigned. These experiences will be integrated with the program’s broader interdisciplinary ethics learning through regular meetings with the Program Director and other practicum students, and a final project that leverages ethical & empirical analyses in a way that meaningfully supports the partner organization. Practicums can be arranged in any of our areas of specialization.
