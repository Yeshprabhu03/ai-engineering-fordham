# Theories and Applications in Contemporary Ethics

## Schedule

**CEED 6100 (3 Credits)**

This is a special session course, listed as part of the Spring 2026 schedule.

Dates: May 2026

Time: 9 am - 5 pm

Location: Rose Hill Campus (Room TBD)

**Course Description**

This intensive three-day graduate level course is designed to provide cross-disciplinary perspectives on moral theory and applied ethics. Using a team-teaching approach, this course brings together faculty from at least six different disciplines to provide foundational knowledge about moral theory with contemporary applications. In addition to seminars on foundations in various disciplines, the course features lectures and case discussions on issues of current social importance. Each day of the three-day course, one pair of faculty lead the curriculum, providing foundational knowledge about their field in the morning and discussing ethical applications in the afternoon.

Breakout sessions are used to discuss cases and generate presentations for the group.

Group presentations are made and discussed among students and faculty.

### Participating Faculty

The cross-disciplinary lectures and discussions are facilitated by Fordham faculty members and outside professionals in relevant disciplines. This six-faculty team taught course includes faculty from the humanities and applied disciplines who are paired to provide both foundational moral theory instruction relevant to their discipline and an ethics application or case. Faculty are rotated each year.

This course is open to all graduate students and to select seniors. Enrollment is limited and students who intend to register are encouraged to do so as soon as as Spring 2026 registration opens. Students may register using CRN number 21387.

Course requirements include:

- a mastery of the reading materials
- active participation in both general discussions, and group presentations
- short, topic-oriented reflection papers during the three-day workshop
- a post-workshop, mentored, interdisciplinary ethics paper, integrating course material and themes

Course faculty, theme, schedule, and readings to be determined. (See below, for examples of previous years’ CEED 6100 courses, including faculty lists and topics.)
