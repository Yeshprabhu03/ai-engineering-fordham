History majors and minors study all facets of world history in our diverse and exciting city. With 10 courses required for the major and six for the minor, students interrogate and challenge mainstream ideas, exploring both the past and the history that unfolds before their eyes in New York. As a student of history, you will take courses that range in topics, periods, and geographies, and introduce you to a breadth of primary and secondary sources.

### Graduate

The department of history offers seven to nine graduate courses each semester, supplemented by course offerings in other programs such as English, Medieval Studies, and Theology. Most courses are rotated on a two- to three-year cycle, and the department encourages faculty to introduce new courses. Several courses are offered every year, such as the proseminar and seminar sequence in U.S. history, modern European history, and medieval history.

All classes meet at the Rose Hill Campus unless otherwise noted. Check [fordham.edu](http://fordham.edu/) for current information on meeting times and places.
