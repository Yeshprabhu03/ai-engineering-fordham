**Research Interests:**

My primary research interests are concentrated around the social history of religious and ecclesial communities in the Middle Ages. I focus on the religious experiences of the laity, and their role in the Church; religious congregations and communities; and rural environments. I am attentive to aesthetics, and questions of art, architecture, music and visual patrimony—specifically of Central and Western Europe in the Middle-Ages and Early Modern period. I am also interested in exploring the development of educational structures, civic and political institutions, and the relationship between secular and religious powers and jurisdictions.
