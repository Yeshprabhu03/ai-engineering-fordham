# Completed Theses

## Completed M.A. Theses

To complete their M.A. degree, History students are required to write and defend a final research paper (40-60 pages) under the direction of a faculty mentor. Students concentrating in medieval history develop a proposal and research paper through the proseminar/seminar sequence. Students concentrating in modern history develop (normally within their coursework) a research proposal in the fall semester; in the spring, they complete the project by taking a research tutorial with a faculty member in which they produce a research proposal and paper.
