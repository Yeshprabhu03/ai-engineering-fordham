Becoming a Historian by Melanie S. Gustafson (2003) is a short booklet published by the AHA that offers advice about every stage of becoming a professional historian, from applying to graduate school to interviewing for an academic position, with sections on applying for fellowships and jobs, building professional relationships, and other aspects of academic life. A copy is available in the History Department.

College and university positions in History are listed in: “Employment Information,” in Perspectives on History: The News magazine of the American Historical Association, issued monthly to members of the AHA.
