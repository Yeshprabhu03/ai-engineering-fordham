Doctoral student Emily Horihan is studying New York City history and the borough of Staten Island.

An M.A. in history is required for admission into the Ph.D. in History. Students applying for the doctoral program who have received an M.A. in history from another university can be admitted straight into the Ph.D. program but may be required to take some additional courses to make up for any deficiencies in academic preparation. Students are generally expected to have concentrated in the same field at the M.A. level as the one that they intend to pursue in the Ph.D. program. If you are unsure about meeting our requirements, please contact the Director of Graduate Studies at [g](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3354405b565d0273555c41575b525e1d565746)[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f196839095999882859e8388b1979e839599909cdf949584).

Upon completion of coursework and language requirements (see below), Ph.D. students will take a comprehensive examination. Reading lists for the examination are developed by the student in conjunction with the student's mentor and examination committee.

Within a year of successfully passing the comprehensive exam, the candidate must present a dissertation prospectus for the approval of the mentor and dissertation committee. After the completion of the dissertation, its oral defense, and submission to the dean, the Ph.D. is awarded.
