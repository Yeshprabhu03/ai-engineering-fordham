# Letters of Recommendation for History Students

Your professors would be happy to write letters of recommendation for your applications for graduate schools, prestigious fellowships, study abroad programs, and jobs.

In order to write a really effective letter, we need YOU to help us. Please provide your professors with the following information:

- A brief written statement of your goals, so that we can refer to them in our letters.
- The resumé you are including, and your applications.
- A reminder of the classes you took with us, and the papers you wrote.
- A list of the extra-curricular activities you have pursued (internships, volunteer work, hobbies, etc.) and achievements, honors, or awards you have received.
- A list of the addresses to which these letters should be sent.
- A FIRM due date for your letter(s). Give us enough time to write a good letter for you. “Immediate” requests may not be possible.
