# Foundation and Track Connected Neuroscience Courses

The **9** Foundation courses serve as the basic “foundation” of the major. At least 3 of these must be taken by the time a student applies to the Program. Advanced placement scores can only be used to fulfill the Calculus/Math requirement (scores of 4 or 5 will be accepted); AP scores cannot be used to replace the Biology or Chemistry requirements.

## Foundation Courses (9 courses)

1-2. Introductory Biology I and II, General Biology I and II, or Concepts in Biology I and II (BISC 1403, 1413, 1404, 1414) or (NSCI 1403, 1413, 1404, 1414) or (NSCI 1423, 1424, 1433, 1434)

3. Applied Calculus (MATH 1203), Calculus (MATH 1206), or Mathematical Modeling (MATH 1700)

4. Foundations of Psychology (1200)

5. Introduction to Programing (CISC 1800/1810) or Information and Data Management (CISC 2500)

6. Data Mining (CISC 4631) or Bioinformatics (CISC 4020)

7-8. Two Chemistry courses (see required courses below for each Specialization)

- Cell and Molecular Neuroscience track— General Chemistry I and II (CHEM 1321, 1331, 1322, 1332 or NSCI 1321, 1331, 1322, 1332)
- Cognitive Neuroscience track or Systems Neuroscience track— General Chemistry I and II (CHEM 1321, 1331, 1322, 1332 or NSCI 1321, 1331, 1322, 1332) OR Interdisciplinary Chemistry I and II with lab (NSCI 1235 and NSCI 1236)

9. Statistics/Research Methods

- Cell and Molecular Neuroscience track—NSCI 2040 or PSYC 2000
- Cognitive Neuroscience track—PSYC 2000
- Systems Neuroscience track—CISC 2850
