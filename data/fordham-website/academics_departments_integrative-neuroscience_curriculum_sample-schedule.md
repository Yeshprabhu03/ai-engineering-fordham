# Integrative Neuroscience Sample Schedule

We recognize the extensive requirements of this Program and thus have created sample scheduling grids that we hope will be helpful to students and their advisors. Of note, you will see that at least 3 Foundation courses (one from each of the three disciplines) are included in the first 3 semesters. Course offerings differ slightly between Rose Hill and Lincoln Center and thus, there are separate grids for RH and LC students.
