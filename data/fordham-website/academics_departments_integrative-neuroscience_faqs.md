# FAQs about Integrative Neuroscience

**I notice there is a minimum science GPA of 3.2, is there a minimum non-science GPA?**

There is no minimum non-science GPA. We calculate science GPA based on all science courses that have been taken including Math, Computer Science, and Psychology courses.

**I did not meet the minimum science GPA by the end of fall semester of sophomore year but I plan to take 2 more science courses in the spring with the aim of boosting my GPA, can I reapply for the major after the next semester is completed?**

Applications are typically accepted at the end of the fall semester. If a student wishes to apply (or reapply) after the spring of sophomore year, he/she must get approval from the Program Director.

**I am a second-semester freshman who just decided that I want to apply for the Neuroscience major next year, what courses should I take?**

Students are required to take 3 Foundation courses by the time they apply. Take a look at the Grids in this Manual for the three tracks and these should help to guide you towards what courses to take. If you have not yet begun the spring semester, it is strongly encouraged that you take at least one Foundation course (likely Calculus, Biopsychology or one of the CISC courses). If you already have your courses set for the spring and they do not include any Foundation courses then you would have to take three in the fall of sophomore year. Likely, this fall schedule would include at least Biology I, if not both Biology I and Chemistry I, so that you can begin to tackle these challenging required courses.

**I am a freshman with a ton of AP credits. Can those be used towards any of the Neuroscience requirements?**

Advanced Placement credits can only be used towards the Calculus requirement. Scores of a 4 or 5 will be accepted in lieu of taking this course.

**Do the three Research Credits (NEUR 4999) need to be registered for and taken in the fall of senior year?**

The program was designed so that students would enroll for these credits in the fall of their senior year to ensure that they are conducting research with a mentor that would fulfill the requirement of being presented at the Undergraduate Research Symposium in the spring semester. That said, accommodations can be made if the student has the support of his/her mentor. For example, if the student wants to apply for an Undergraduate Research Award that supplies research funding as well as a stipend, he/she cannot register for the 3-credits that same semester so the student can register for NEUR 4999 in the subsequent semester. Such an arrangement requires the approval of the Program Director.

**Can I study abroad as an Integrative Neuroscience major?**

There is no rule that says that Neuroscience students cannot study abroad as long as they can stay on track with the Program and Core requirements. It is suggested that students study at Fordham institutions such as London where they can take courses towards the core in case there are none that can satisfy Major requirements. Approval for courses taken towards the major needs to be obtained from the individual department where a similar course would have been taken. For example, if a student wants to take a course abroad to fulfill a cognitive neuroscience elective, he or she needs the approval of the Psychology Dept. or Dr. Roy as a representative of that department. If you are interested in studying abroad, it is suggested that you make an appointment to discuss this with the Program Director.

**Can I minor in another department?**

Again, there is no rule that Integrative Neuroscience students cannot pursue a minor. Students should just be reminded of the large time burden associated with the Neuroscience program and the University guidelines around “double counting” courses for majors and minors. Students may not pursue a minor in the Department associated with the area of specialization with the Neuroscience Major. For example, a Systems Neuroscience student cannot minor in Computer and Information Science, although he could minor in Biology or Natural Science.
