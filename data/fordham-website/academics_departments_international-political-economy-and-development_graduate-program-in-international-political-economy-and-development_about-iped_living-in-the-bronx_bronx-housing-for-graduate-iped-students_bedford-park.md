Tree-lined Moshulu Parkway runs through the geographical center of the neighborhoods of Bedford Park and Norwood. Bedford Park lies to the south of Moshulu Parkway while Norwood lies to the north of Moshulu Parkway.

While it is a few blocks longer than the walk to Belmont, Bedford Park is still within walking distance of the campus. Bedford Park lies just to the north and west of the campus and many of our graduate students have chosen to live in the neighborhood. In general, the housing stock is newer than the housing stock in Belmont.

This apartment building, which is typical of buildings in Bedford Park, lies one block south of Moshulu Parkway and is about a 10-minute walk from campus.
