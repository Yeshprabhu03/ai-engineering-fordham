# Belmont Neighborhood

![Belmont Neighborhood](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/international-political-economy-and-development/Belmont_Neighborhood_5.jpeg)

Our Bronx Rose Hill campus is adjacent to the New York Botanical Gardens, the world famous Bronx Zoo, as well as Belmont, the Bronx's own Little Italy along Arthur Avenue. Little Italy is known throughout the metropolitan region for its restaurants and pastry shops, offering bread, pasta, meat, pastries, espresso machines, Italian sausages, and more.

Since Belmont is directly south of Fordham's Rose Hill Campus and within easy walking distance, many graduate students choose to live in this neighborhood.

Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church lies at the geographical center of Belmont at the corner of Belmont Avenue and 187th Street in the Bronx. The front of Mt. Carmel Church was the setting for *A Bronx Tale* which starred Robert DeNiro. The corner directly diagonal from the Church has been designated by New York City as "Doo Wop" corner since it was here in the 1950s that "Dion and the Belmonts" first began to vocalize.

As an example of the type of housing available on the local market are small row houses on Bathgate Avenue. Apartments in these particular houses have been very popular with Fordham Graduate students. Their interiors were renovated to cater to graduate students. They are adjacent to the University's entrance on Bathgate Avenue and are therefore only a few minute walk away from class. And because of their proximity to one of the University's main entrances, they benefit from a 24 hour university security presence.
