# The John F. Hurley S.J. Commendation

This commendation recalls the legacy of Fr. John F. Hurley, S.J. (1892-1967) by honoring a member of Fordham’s family who has actively promoted the work of Catholic Relief Services in the United States. Fr. Hurley was a 1914 alumnus of Fordham College and the founder of Catholic Relief Services in the Philippines.

As the Jesuit superior in the Philippines during some of the darkest days of the Pacific War, Fr. Hurley established an underground network of supporters who clandestinely supplied funds, food and medicines to Filipinos and Americans, many of whom were living in internment camps. For his heroic service on behalf of a grateful people, General MacArthur personally conferred upon Fr. Hurley the U.S. Medal of Freedom.
