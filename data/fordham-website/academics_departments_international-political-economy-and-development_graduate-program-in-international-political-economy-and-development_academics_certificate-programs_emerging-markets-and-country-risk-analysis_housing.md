Summer Housing (double occupancy) is available in modern Fordham Dormitories at the Rose Hill Campus in the Bronx. Our scenic 85 acre Rose Hill Campus is an easy commute to Manhattan with its wide range of internships and cultural opportunities.

Safe and clean Metro North Commuter trains leave adjacent from the campus nearly every 30 minutes and arrive at New York's Grand Central Terminal on the East Side of Manhattan within 19 minutes.

The university also runs inexpensive Ram Vans that depart nearly every half hour from campus and arrive at our other campus at Lincoln Center on the West Side of Manhattan in about 30 minutes depending upon traffic.

If you need summer housing in New York and are interested in staying in a Fordham dorm, be sure to indicate this on your application form so we can send you a Summer Session Housing Application for Visiting Students. Housing applications can only be processed after you have been admitted and are registered for summer courses.
