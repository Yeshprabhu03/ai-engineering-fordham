![Professor Teaching Graduate Students](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/international-political-economy-and-development/The_Specialization_in_International_Development_Economics_MD.jpeg)

The International and Development Economics Specialization is open to all IPED students accepted into the program. This specialization is designed to prepare individuals to work as economists in primarily in the public sector but also in the private sector. As part of this specialization you will study International Economic Policy, International Monetary Policy, Economic Development Policy, and Applied Econometrics. Because of its heavy economic content (21 credits of economics plus a statistics course, Applied Econometrics), anyone completing it will qualify for designation as an economist by the US federal government. Students who wish to combine a strong economics specialization (international, development, finance, monetary) with a strong interdisciplinary specialization (international banking and finance or international development studies) may wish to complete the Dual MA-IPED/MA-Economics Program. If interested in the dual degree program, see your academic advisor early on in your program of studies.
