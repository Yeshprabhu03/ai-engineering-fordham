The course of studies for the specialization in International Banking and Finance is open to all students accepted into the IPED program. Students interested in careers as financial analysts are urged to prepare for and take the examination for designation as a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA). Fordham IPED students frequently get scholarships to help pay for the cost of preparing for and taking the CFA examination.
