![Graduate Student with Horse](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/international-political-economy-and-development/Internships_1_MD.jpeg)

IPED students who lack previous relevant professional experience may complete an internship to fulfill IPED’s practical training requirement. Before registering for an internship, students must have completed 18 credits and be in good academic standing. The IPED Program provides various opportunities for students to pursue an internship through the following programs:

Students can complete up to two internships for credit and are also free to pursue not-for-credit internships if they wish.

- The IPED Internship Program (
[IPED 8085 and IPED 8080 IPED Internship](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/gsas/iped/#courselistingtext#IPED8085)) is designed to provide our students with the practical training they need to compete in today's market place. The internship must also be with an approved international and/or development organization such as a major international bank or business, the United Nations and its associated organizations, US and non-US governmental agencies with international responsibilities, non-profit international organizations, or an international media organization. - Overseas Internships are highly recommended. Almost all career paths value international exposure and foreign language ability, while many career paths require it. Previous IPED students have had internship experiences in Asia, Latin America, and Africa.

The IPED Intern Fellowship Program (IPED 8090 IPED Intern Fellow), through close collaboration with our alumni and others, supports internships in the private sector (usually in the financial services sector), in government (both US and UN), and in the non-profit sector (both international development and human rights).

While internships can be repeated, fellowship awards are given only once. IPED Intern fellows are exempted from any tuition charges associated with their internship. Successful applicants will also be able to receive a modest stipend of at least USD $500 and as high as USD $4,000.
