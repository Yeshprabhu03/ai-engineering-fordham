In this class students are trained to improve their investment analyses and financial decision-making skills by studying macroeconomic indicators, foreign exchange rates, and stock markets.

Students will collect and analyze economic and financial data on South Africa and compare it with similar data on other emerging markets as well as more established markets. At the end of the course students will attempt to determine the prospects for US equity investment in South Africa or another emerging market. Students will be assigned to five teams that can meet in the evenings, Monday through Thursday, to complete their assignments.

### Site Visits and Excursions

Students will also have the opportunity to interact with South African and US business, labor and government representatives. The visits complement the data and theories students learn in class and help them put these into practice. Most afternoons and Fridays are used for academic field trips. There are also weekend excursions.

### Eligibility

Graduate students or undergraduate students able to participate in graduate-level classes are welcome to join through a competitive selection process.
