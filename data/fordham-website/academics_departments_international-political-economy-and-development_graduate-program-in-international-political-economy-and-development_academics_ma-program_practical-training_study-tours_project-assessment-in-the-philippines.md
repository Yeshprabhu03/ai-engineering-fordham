# Project Assessment in the Philippines

![IPEd Group in Philippines](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/international-political-economy-and-development/PH_2_MD.jpeg)

This course trains students to monitor and evaluate (M&E) community level development projects. The program includes three pre-departure lectures and can be credited as a summer course.

### Topics

Using the logical framework analysis, frequently mandated by the US Agency for International Development and implemented by many private voluntary organizations such as Catholic Relief Services, students are exposed to various methodologies of designing a results-based system to monitor and evaluate small community development projects. Quantitative methods such as randomization, propensity score matching, and double-difference are reviewed. The course also reviews the use of qualitative survey tools.

A key component of the course requires students to form teams that will conduct field surveys to assess actual local community development projects in the surrounding provinces outside of metropolitan Manila.

### The Communities

The Philippines’ rich and vibrant civil society provides us with a large number of community organizations and development projects focusing on fisher folks, farmers, indigenous people, women, the rural poor, and the environment, among others. Students are given a chance to interact with the local communities during their field visits.

To complement our academic programming, our study tour of the Philippines will also include several cultural excursions and social events in and outside of Metro Manila.

### Eligibility

Graduate students or undergraduate students able to participate in graduate-level classes are welcome to join through a competitive selection process.
