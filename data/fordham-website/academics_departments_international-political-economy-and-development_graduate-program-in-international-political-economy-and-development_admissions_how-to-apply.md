Application for admission and financial aid is made through Fordham’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences’ online application: [GSAS Online Application](https://gradadmissions.fordham.edu/portal/gsas_application).

The following application materials may be submitted online through the above online application system: the statement of purpose, resume, and recommendations.

International applicants whose native language is not English are required to complete and submit to GSAS prior to matriculation their official scores from the [Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)](https://www.ets.org/toefl). GSAS will also consider a student’s [International English Language Testing System (IELTS)—Cambridge English Proficiency Level](https://www.ielts.org/) language testing results.

Official TOEFL or IELTS scores should be sent directly by the testing service to the Office of Graduate Admissions, Fordham University, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences – Code # 2259. Please consult the [IPED International Students](/academics/departments/international-political-economy-and-development/graduate-program-in-international-political-economy-and-development/admissions/international-students/) page for additional information.

When communicating with your **recommendation letter writers**, please provide them with at least one month’s advance notice to submit their recommendations. To facilitate this process, enter each recommender’s name and her/his email address directly into the online application. They will be notified electronically of your request. Please note: you may submit your application even if the submission of your recommendation letters is in progress.

**Academic Transcripts**

To be eligible for admission, applicants must hold a four-year bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university in the United States, or the equivalent of a U.S. bachelor’s degree from a recognized institution abroad (for some countries, this may be a three-year degree from a [member institution](https://ehea.info/page-full_members) within the [Bologna Process](http://www.ehea.info/)). If you are applying during your final (senior) year of undergraduate study, you may submit your application with an unofficial transcript that includes all completed coursework to date.

When you apply, you are required to upload unofficial transcripts from the institution where you earned or will earn your bachelor’s degree, and if applicable, master’s degree, including any institutions where transfer credits counted toward either an undergraduate or graduate-level degree.

**International students: **Transcripts from previously attended post-secondary institutions must be submitted in English or with a certified English translation. For academic transcripts from institutions outside the United States, applicants are encouraged to obtain a course-by-course credential evaluation. See [GSAS International Students](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/admissions/international-students/) for more information.

If you are offered admission to a GSAS program and accept the offer, you must submit official final transcripts with final grades and the title of the degree conferred. Official transcripts must be received by Fordham GSAS Admissions **before the first day of classes**.
