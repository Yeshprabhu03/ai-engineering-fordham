This section of our web site is devoted to our alumni. Presently you may find out about our Alumni Career Network or visit the alumni services offered by the university. Under related sites you might want to visit our Career Placement Services and find out what we have available for young alumni just starting out and older alumni who might be changing jobs.

Be sure to be on our mailing list by emailing the IPED Office at: [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#254c55404165434a57414d44480b404150).

Include your name, address, phone number, and email. Once on our mailing list you will receive an annual alumni survey that, when completed and returned, will entitle you to your free copy of the The IPED Alumni Career Network. You also will receive in the mail each year free copies of our student produced publications, Emerging Markets Watch, Current Issues in Development, and Global Briefs. IPED hosts four alumni events each year where you can meet new IPED students, catch up with old IPED classmates and friends, and socialize with IPED professors and staff.

- Fall (November) – Alumni Gathering in Washington, DC, USA
- Winter (January) – Alumni Fiesta in Manila, Philippines
- Spring (March) – Alumni Career Networking and Social Night, New York, USA
- Summer (August) - Alumni Braai in Pretoria, South Africa

The IPED Office will send you an email invitation for the specific dates and details of these events. Frequently mailing labels become outdated and we lose contact with some of our alumni. A key strength of our IPED Program is our alumni network. If you are not receiving these mailings, then please let us know by emailing the IPED Office at: [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d3baa3b6b793b5bca1b7bbb2befdb6b7a6).
