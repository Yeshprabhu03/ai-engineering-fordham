Bea Lumanas (IPED ’13), from the Philippines, won an International Peace and Development (IDP) Internship with Catholic Relief Services (CRS) after her IPED studies. Consequently, she landed a full-time country staff position in Afghanistan.

All full-time applicants who indicated on their application forms that they are interested in merit-based financial aid will be considered for Presidential Fellowships and Graduate Assistantships. Presidential Fellowships cover all tuition costs while Graduate Assistantships provide a generous stipend in exchange for 18 hours per week of service when the university is in session during the academic year. Exceptional applicants are exempted from the service requirement.

This scholarship is used primarily to attract the most academically gifted candidates into the IPED Program. It is offered solely on the basis of academic merit as judged by your letter of intent, letters of recommendation, transcripts of previous undergraduate and graduate course works, and general aptitude scores on the [Graduate Record Exam (GRE)](http://www.ets.org/gre). For international students the [Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)](http://www.ets.org/toefl) is substituted for the verbal score on the GRE.
