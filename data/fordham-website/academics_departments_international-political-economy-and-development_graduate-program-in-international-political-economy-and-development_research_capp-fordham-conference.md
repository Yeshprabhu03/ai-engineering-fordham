![CAPP Fordham Conference](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/Picture33.png)

The biennial CAPP-Fordham Conferences bring together international specialists, authorities and professionals who highlight issues of poverty and development raised by Pope Francis. The conferences, attended by a large and varied group of Catholic and non-Catholic experts, seek to address these issues through the lens of Catholic Social Teaching.

*"Fondazione Centesimus Annus - Pro Pontifice" or CAPP was established by Pope John Paul II on 13 June 1993 along with lay Catholic business, academic and professional leaders. The Foundation is a lay-led non-profit-organization with the purpose of promoting the Catholic social teaching. It is headquartered in the Vatican.*

### The next conference will happen during UN Week in September 2020.

**2018 Conference:****“Reduce Hunger: Pope Francis' Call for New Approaches", Sept 28, 2016**Pope Francis issued a challenge in his 2017 World Food Day address at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) where he encouraged a "broad and sincere dialogue...to find new ways...the best solutions...to confront hunger and structural poverty in a more effective and promising way."

Responding to this challenge, CAPP-USA and Fordham University's Graduate Program in International Political Economy and Development hosted world experts at a conference with the challenge to identify "concrete actions" to "reduce the number of those going hungry...to guarantee to all human beings the right to be nourished."
