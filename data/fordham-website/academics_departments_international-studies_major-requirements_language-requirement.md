# Language Requirement for International Studies

Students must take two additional language courses beyond the Fordham Core Language Requirement. The language must be appropriate for the selected track:

**The International Track:** One of the UN languages (Arabic, Chinese, French, Russian, or Spanish).

**The Regional Track:** Any language spoken in the chosen region.

If students want to continue in the language with which they have met the core requirement, and this language is appropriate to their selected track, they can do so by taking two more advanced classes in the same language.

If students want to begin a new language (or must, because of the selected track), they need only take two classes (at any level) to meet the requirement.

Students may meet the language requirement through transfer or study abroad courses. These courses do not count towards the transfer or study abroad limit. The IS director shall make the determination that the requirement is met upon evaluation of the course description and syllabus.
