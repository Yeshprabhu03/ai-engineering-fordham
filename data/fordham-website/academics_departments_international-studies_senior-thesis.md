### Design and Research Your Own Thesis project

International Studies students must enroll in a Senior Thesis Seminar (INST 4000) during the fall semester of their senior year and complete a thesis of approximately 10,000 words. The thesis should address an original research question related to a student’s selected track within the major. In addition to working with the thesis seminar instructor, each student must have a [faculty advisor](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSezFAhEcs1LLqCuPeiDZp8gUumW0zM1mn13fK41T5cUGlLoWw/viewform) who can provide individual guidance related to the selected research topic.

The International Studies program typically hosts an organizational meeting for majors at the end of their junior year. Before the beginning of their senior year, students should secure a faculty advisor for their thesis, conduct preliminary research on their topic of interest, and be prepared to submit a research proposal at the beginning of their senior year.

Students can publish their completed thesis projects through the Fordham Library’s Electronic Repository, [DigitalResearch@Fordham](http://fordham.bepress.com/international_senior/), which is part of the Digital Commons Network.

If you would like to submit your completed thesis for publication, please complete a submission form and follow the instructions listed therein:
