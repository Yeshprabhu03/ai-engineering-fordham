How the Talmudic Rabbis Transformed Everything into a Legal Question and Jewish Law into a Way of Talking about Everything

Chaim N. Saiman, Professor of Law, Villanova University, Pennsylvania

with responses by Sarit Kattan Gribetz (Fordham University) and Saul Berman (Yeshiva University and Columbia University Law School)

Fordham Law School, 150 West 62nd Street

In Chaim N. Saiman’s book Halakhah: The Rabbinic Idea of Law, halakhah, or Jewish law, as a legal system is not only a guide to life but also an ongoing encounter with the divine; is not just a body of regulations, but a way of thinking, being, and knowing. Professor Saiman will show how, when pored over and studied, even laws that can seem to provide no practical purpose can provide surprising insights into timeless questions about the very nature of human existence:

What does it mean for legal analysis to connect humans to God? Can spiritual teachings remain meaningful even when rigorously codified? Can a modern state be governed by such law?

‘To My Beloved Teacher in Eretz Israel’: Childhood, Diaspora, and Zionism in Letters Written by Hebrew School Pupils in Interwar Poland

David Assaf will discuss a treasure trove of some ninety letters written in 1935 by Polish Jewish children (age 12-13) who studied in the Tarbut school north of Warsaw to their teacher who immigrated to Palestine. These moving letters of elementary school pupils (not young adults like those who participated in YIVO competitions for autobiographies) offer a very rare glimpse into the childhood of Jewish children in interwar Poland.

Fordham Law School, 150 West 62nd Street, Room 1-032017-2018 is the inaugural year of a partnership between Fordham University and the New York Public Library. Six inaugural Fordham-NYPL fellows in Jewish Studies will give talks and presentations of their new work.

This first lecture in this series will offer a genealogical study of the term "Jewish mysticism" and of the ideological and theological presuppositions that govern the study of Kabbalah and Hasidism. It will critically examine the perception that Kabbalah and Hasidism are Jewish manifestations of a universal mystical phenomenon. It will discuss the historical contexts and processes that led to the invention of Jewish mysticism and to the ways this category shaped the academic study and public perception of Kabbalah, while influencing contemporary forms of Kabbalah and Hasidism.

"Religious Nationalism in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict."

Ross Brann, the Milton R. Konvitz Professor of Judeo-Islamic Studies and Stephen H. Weiss Presidential Fellow at Cornell UniversityThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict was born out of competing nationalisms in the same land and to a large extent it remains a struggle over land and rights. However, the events of 1967 and 1979 in Middle East catalyzed the latent forces of religious nationalism further complicating the unresolved conflict between two peoples in the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea

“Multiple Legal Views: A Comparison of the Methods of Early Modern Legal Humanists and Rabbi Joseph Caro, author of the Standard Code of Jewish Law (Shulhan Arukh)”

Fordham University, Lincoln Center, 12th Floor Lounge, Lowenstein

Edward Fram, Ben-Gurion UniversityAlready in Roman times, there was a need for guidance in how to decide between multiple legal views. A solution was offered by the

*lex citationum*, the so called “laws of citations” which was included in the Theodosian Code (438). The laws gave rules as to which views should be followed in which situations. In the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, with learned law assuming an ever greater role in the life of towns, European jurists too faced a plethora of legal views. This talk will focus on how legal humanists proposed to deal with these legal conundrums and compare their approaches to that used by their contemporary, Rabbi Joseph Caro, who was busy creating what would become the standard code of Jewish law,*Shulhan Arukh*.Response by Ethan J. Leib, Professor of Law, Fordham School of Law, and W. David Myers, Professor of History, Fordham University.

Moderated by Tsvi Blanchard, the Meyer Struckmann Professor of Jewish Law at Humboldt Faculty of Law in Berlin.

"Competing Ideologies of Hebrew Use at American Jewish Summer Camps"

Sarah Bunin BenorWhat is the role of Hebrew in contemporary American Jewish life? This talk focuses on one type of Jewish educational institution: summer camps, which incorporate Hebrew to varying degrees, ranging from a few Hebrew words and songs to Hebrew immersion programs. At many of these camps, staff members hold conflicting ideologies about how much Hebrew to use and whether it is acceptable to use only borrowed nouns rather than full Hebrew sentences. Grammar sticklers at several camps criticize the use of clippings, like

*meltz*(wait tables) from Hebrew*meltzar*(waiter) and blends, like*t’floptions*(*tefillah*[prayer] options). This talk analyzes these competing stances in light of research on language ideology and language socialization and discusses how the discourses are influenced by the historical revernacularization of Hebrew and the influx of Israeli staff members.Sarah Bunin Benor is Associate Professor of Contemporary Jewish Studies at Hebrew Union College – Jewish Institute of Religion (Los Angeles) and Adjunct Associate Professor in the University of Southern California Linguistics Department. She received her Ph.D. from Stanford University in Linguistics in 2004. She is the author of

*Becoming Frum: How Newcomers Learn the Language and Culture of Orthodox Judaism*(Rutgers University Press, 2012), as well as many articles about Jewish language, Yiddish, and American Jews.

“Stepchildren of the Shtetl: Destitute and Disabled Outcasts of East European Jewish Society, 1800-1939”

Natan MeirHow do we grasp the inner workings and mentalities of a society beyond the usual approach of analyzing its central institutions and groups? In this talk, Natan Meir takes the road less traveled by way of looking at society’s outcasts, its underclass, and presents an analysis of Jewish society in eastern Europe in the 19th and early 20th centuries based on the experiences of and attitudes towards beggars, vagrants, disabled people, and the mentally ill. In his talk, Meir offers a new lens through which to view Russian and Polish Jewry: the experience of the marginalized.

Natan Meir is the Lorry I. Lokey Chair in Judaic Studies at Portland State University in Portland, Oregon. He is the author of

*Kiev, Jewish Metropolis: A History, 1859-1914*(Indiana University Press, 2010), and a co-editor of*Anti-Jewish Violence: Rethinking the Pogrom in East European History*(Indiana University Press, 2010).

Medieval Lecture

Magda Teter

Lecture for faculty and students.Unlike earlier medieval persecutions of Jews accused of murdering Christian children, whose impact was rather local, the story of Simon of Trent, who was found dead in 1475, spread far and wide, influencing for centuries to come anti-Jewish trials, their visual representation, Jewish defense, and even canon law. This lecture will sketch the reasons why the figure of Simon of Trent became a liminal and key figure in shaping Jewish-Christian relations.
