# Languages and Cultures: Arabic

The minor in Arabic offers students the opportunity to study the Arabic language and culture structurally and functionally. Our curriculum reflects the Standards for Foreign Language Learning in the 21st Century (1999) which describes the five C's of language acquisition: communication, culture, comparisons, connections, and community. Students in the Arabic minor have the opportunity to practice the three modes of communication (interpersonal, interpretive, and presentational), to learn about Arabic culture (products, practices, and perspectives), and to make comparisons between their first language and culture and the Arabic language and culture. In addition, students make connections to other fields of study unavailable to them through their native language.

**Study Abroad Policy**

Studying abroad is not required. However, students interested in the Arabic minor are strongly encouraged to study in an Arabic-speaking country, such as Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, or Syria, for at least one semester. The study abroad programs provide the student with classes of Modern Standard Arabic and an immersion experience in a spoken Arabic dialect. Up to two courses for the Arabic minor may be taken abroad.

Note: Students who opt to apply study abroad credits toward their minor must have these courses approved by their Arabic faculty adviser prior to their going abroad.
