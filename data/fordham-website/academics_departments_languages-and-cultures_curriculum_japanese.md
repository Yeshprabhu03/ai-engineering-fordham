# Languages and Cultures: Japanese

Here at Fordham, we offer a number of Japanese language courses that can cater to your

needs whether you are an absolute beginner to the language or an experienced learner with a

few years of studying under your belt. We believe in working together with our students to build

a community where you feel engaged and comfortable in learning and experimenting with

Japanese language with everyone in class. We aim to guide you in building a strong

foundation and a set of skills you need to effectively utilize Japanese in real-life situations. We

very much look forward to taking on the language learning journey with you!

**Not sure which level of Japanese course is right for you?**

If you already have some knowledge in Japanese language, whether it be by taking formal classes, by being a [heritage speaker](https://www.languagetesting.com/heritage-speakers-frequently-asked-questions#:~:text=When%20we%20talk%20about%20heritage,formally%20in%20a%20school%20setting.), or by self-studying, you will need to take a placement test to be placed in the right level of a course. You can find some general guidelines for the [Language Placement](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/departments/languages-and-cultures/language-placement/) on the Languages and Cultures Department website. For Japanese language placement specifically, you will need to consult with a Japanese faculty adviser. For more information, please contact the Department Associate Chair, [Dr. Yiju Huang](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/departments/languages-and-cultures/faculty/yiju-huang/).
