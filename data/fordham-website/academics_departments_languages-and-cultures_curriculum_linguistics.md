# Languages and Cultures: Linguistics

[The Linguistics minor](/undergraduate-admission/majors-and-minors/linguistics/) offers students interdisciplinary training in the scientific study of language. Through the study of linguistics, students gain insights into fundamental aspects of human communication and develop a fuller understanding of the complexities of language and communication. Students will finish the minor with a heightened awareness of what language is, how language works and is used, and how the study of language intersects with a multitude of disciplines. The Linguistics minor provides students with tools for studying language from diverse perspectives, and these skills complement several areas including anthropology, biology, business, computer science, education, languages and literatures, neuroscience, psychology, and sociology. The minor consists of six (6) courses and is open to students in all Fordham colleges, for further information see the Academic Bulletin.
