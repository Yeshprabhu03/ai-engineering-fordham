Andrew H. Clark is author of Diderot's Part (Ashgate 2008) and, with the musicologist Keith Chapin, Speaking of Music (Fordham 2013). He specializes on questions of aesthetics, physiology, music, and literature in 17th and 18th century France and Europe. He has published articles in
*Eighteenth Century: Theory and Context, Diderot Studies*,*Méthode!**Revue de littérature française et comparée*, and*Shark*, and various book chapters and reviews. He has just completed*The*, a book which examines visual portraiture and the origin of the modern novel in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century France. His new research project is on wigs in France from the seventeenth century through the Revolution. Professor Clark teaches in both the French and comparative literature programs. He is Co-Director of the Ailey/Fordham BFA Program, Co-Director of the Matteo Ricci Seminar at FCLC, and Co-Director of the NY 18th-Century Seminar, and Director of a forthcoming Dance minor, which should begin in 2025. He directed the Fordham in France Summer Program from 2004 to 2011 and previously served as Vice President of the Senate (2013-2016, 2017-2018), Chair of the Salary and Benefits Committee (2009-2013, 2015-2018, Co-Chair 2013-14), Chair of the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures (2015-2018, 2019-2022), Co-Director of the Comparative Literature program (2008-2011), President of NEASECS (2019-21), and Co-President of the Academic Advisory Board for CUPA (2010-22). In 2020, he spearheaded, with a small group of colleagues, the MLL Vocab Diversity Initiative which had three different iterations, and which has organized numerous roundtables, workshops, and two for-credit anti-racist pedagogy undergraduate seminars to combat racism and strive for greater equity and inclusion in the teaching of languages and in our language curriculum. A collaborative book on the project with contributors from the various roundtables and workshops will be published by CALEC and is currently being edited. Dr. Clark will be writing the introduction and be one of the editors of the book. The initiative has been supported through generous funding from the TRAC grant of the Chief Diversity Officer and the Dean's Challenge grant.Portrait and Its Double: Visual Portraiture and the Birth of the Novel in Ancien Régime France
