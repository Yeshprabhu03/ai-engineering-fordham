Jacqueline Herranz Brooks is a queer Cuban literary scholar, bridging her research expertise with her visual art practice. Her interest in contemporary culture is primary to her work as a writer and educator. As an author of several books of autofiction, Jacqueline explores the process of fictionalization of personal events and focuses on the creation of intellectual personas. Her writing projects and research are informed by the counterhegemonic-experimental aesthetics of the New York Latinx hybrid practices. Her area of scholarship lays in the intersection of literary theory (autofiction) and criticism (poststructuralism, feminism), Persona Studies and Performance Studies. Among her core interests are the literature produced in Spanish in the USA, diasporic creations in New York, representation of homoerotic desire, hybridity -in genre, language, and media-, and transmediality.
