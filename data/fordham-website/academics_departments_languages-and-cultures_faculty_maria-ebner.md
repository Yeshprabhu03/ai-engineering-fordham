Maria Ebner, in addition to teaching all levels of German language, teaches cross-disciplinary undergraduate courses with a focus on film, urban and women studies. Additionally, she is the coordinator for the German Language Program at Fordham University as well. She received her undergraduate education in her native Austria before attending Vanderbilt University, where she earned her Master’s and Ph.D. in German Literature. There she also held a position at the Center for Teaching consulting on topics of teaching and professional development across disciplines. Her field of research explores the many realms of migration, identity formation and representation, and portraying images of minorities in literature, film, and art. The approach to research, she is interested in, aims for an extra-disciplinary perspective extending from literature to philosophy to performance and cultural theory. She is drawn to the potentiality of writing love and death, dilemmas in representation, and revolutionary ideas of writing and heterotopias. Maria Ebner is also an enthusiastic painter and woodworker with a strong interest in the intersections of visual arts and texts.
