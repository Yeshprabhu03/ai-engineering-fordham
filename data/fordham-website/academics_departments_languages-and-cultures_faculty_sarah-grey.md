Sarah Grey's research focuses on the neurocognition of adult second language acquisition (SLA) and bilingualism. Informed by multiple areas - including psycholinguistics, applied linguistics, and cognitive psychology- she uses behavioral and electrophysiological techniques to study adult language learning and bilingual language processing as well as the effects of cognitive, social, and biological individual differences on learning/processing. Her work has appeared in
