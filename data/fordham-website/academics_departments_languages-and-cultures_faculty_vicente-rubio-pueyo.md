**Book:**[Un país entre dos tiempos. La década en que España experimentó políticamente](https://lenguadetrapo.com/libros/ensayo/un-pais-entre-dos-tiempos/)[A Country Between Two Times. The Decade When Spain Experimented Politically ] (Lengua de Trapo/Círculo de Bellas Artes, Spain).The book tries to explain how the crises, movements and new political formations in Spain emerged within the last decade (2008-2020) have transformed the political culture of Spanish Democracy. Starting with an overview of Spanish Democracy from 1978 to the 2008 crisis, the book follows the sudden eruption of the 15M or*Indignados*movement in 2011; the emergence of new progressive formations such as the Municipalist confluences and Left Populist Podemos in 2015; and the later reactionary response in the form of the post-fascist party VOX. Written from a cultural studies perspective, the book aims to provide a conceptual map of the discourses and notions these forces and movements put in motion throughout an intense decade of political experimentation and turbulence, and to connect them to the current political landscape.**Notes and editing work:**Stuart Hall, Chas Critcher, Tony Jefferson, John Clark, Brian Roberts.[Gobernar la crisis.
