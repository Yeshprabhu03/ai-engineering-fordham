A scholar of modern Chinese literature and culture, Yiju Huang is interested in exploring the intersection of deep sociopolitical transformations and shifting paradigms of aesthetic productions. Her book,

*Tapestry of Light: Aesthetic Afterlives of the Cultural Revolution*(Brill, 2014), offers an account of the psychic, intellectual, and cultural aftermath of the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Drawing on a wide range of works including fiction, memoir, painting and film, she explores links between history, trauma and aesthetic representation. Yiju has ongoing interests in classical Chinese literature and philosophy and their influence on modern and contemporary China. She is currently working on a book manuscript on the spiritual dimension of Chinese literary modernity. -
