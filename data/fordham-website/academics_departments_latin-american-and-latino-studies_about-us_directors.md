**Daniel T. Contreras, LALSI's Director,** is an Associate Professor of English who specializes in the literature of Latinos in the United States. He is the author of the book, *What Have You Done to My Heart: Unrequited Love and Gay Latino Culture,”*which explores the correspondences between being Latino and being in love.

He teaches classes on Latino Literature in the US, Latino Literature in NYC, and on Queer Latino Literature. He also teaches classes on Midcentury US Literature and Culture and on Postmodern Experimental Fiction.

His most recent project, *Tejano: Growing up Mexican in Texas History* is an auto-ethnography of growing up queer in the borderlands of the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas. The book utilizes memoir and history to explore the perils and the frisson of the Latino experience.
