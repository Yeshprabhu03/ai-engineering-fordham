# LALSI Events

The Latin American and Latino Studies Institute hosts, co–sponsors and collaborates on many events throughout the academic year. These include lectures, film screenings, performances and student-sponsored activities. All faculty, graduate and undergraduate students are invited. A reception normally follows each LALSI sponsored event.

We use our social media platforms to announce our events. Please stay up-to-date with all upcoming LALS events by liking our pages, joining our groups, following us, etc.
