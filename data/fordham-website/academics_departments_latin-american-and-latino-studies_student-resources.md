# LALSI Student Resources

## Prizes

The Latin American and Latino Studies Institute grants two awards annually to students of exceptional talent and promise: the Angelo Rodríguez Research Award and the Bernardo Vega-Rigoberta Menchú Tum Award.

## The Angelo Rodríguez Research Award

This award was initially established in 1990 by Professor Clara Rodríguez in honor of her father and was financed by royalties from her book The Puerto Rican Struggle: Essays on Survival in the U. S. It provides for an annual prize for original and significant work in the field of Latin American and Latino Studies. All Fordham undergraduate students are eligible. Faculty members nominate students based on the production of superior in-class work during the academic year. The deadline for nominations and submission of work is the first Friday in May.

Since its inception, the Rodríguez Award has received additional support from friends and alumni of LALSI.

## The Bernardo Vega – Rigoberta Menchú Tum Award

Named for a pioneering Puerto Rican worker-intellectual and a Nobel Prize winning author, the award is given annually to the graduating Fordham College Rose Hill senior who, in the judgment of the LALSI faculty, has demonstrated excellence in LALSI major.

## Fellowships

Working closely with LALSI faculty mentors, LALSI students have won many prestigious fellowships including Fulbright awards for Bolivia and Costa Rica, and National Science Foundation grants to Mexico. These nationally competitive grants allow students to pursue their own research abroad. Students typically begin planning during their sophomore or junior year if they wish to compete for a prestigious fellowship. Contact the Campion Institute for information on fellowships as well as the Director or Associate Director of LALSI.

## Scholarships

Partial tuition scholarships may be available for school teachers interested in pursuing the Master's degree.
