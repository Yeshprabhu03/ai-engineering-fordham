My research concerns probability, stochastic processes, and their applications. I am particularly interested in analysis of non-Markovian stochastic processes, including fractional Brownian motion and Levy processes that are composed with random time changes, as well as stochastic differential equations driven by those processes. Such non-Markovian processes provide models for complicated phenomena with memories and have found many important applications in areas such as economics, physics, chemistry, biology, and finance. In terms of the stochastic differential equations, my previous results concern both theory (stochastic integration, the corresponding stochastic calculus, etc.) and its applications (numerical approximation schemes for the solution processes, their associated Fokker-Planck or Kolmogorov equations which may be of fractional order, etc.).
