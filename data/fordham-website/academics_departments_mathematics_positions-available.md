# Mathematics Positions Available

## Faculty Positions for Spring/Fall 2025

### Peter M. Curran Visiting Professorships

The Department of Mathematics at Fordham University invites applications, subject to final budgetary approval, for three Peter M. Curran Research Instructorships, two to be based at our Rose Hill campus and one at our Lincoln Center campus, and all to start in the Fall of 2026.

These are fixed term positions to be offered to a graduating or recent PhD who has demonstrated strong research potential and success in undergraduate teaching. The initial term is two years with an option, subject to satisfactory performance in the initial term, for one two-year renewal. The expected annual base salary for these positions is $76,250.

Candidates in all areas of pure and applied mathematics are encouraged to apply. We especially encourage applications from candidates whose specialties give promise of leading to research collaborations with our permanent faculty, or who have applied their work in collaborations with researchers in non-mathematical disciplines. Please share any experiences you have with inclusive pedagogical practices.

Applications should be submitted online through [mathjobs.org](http://mathjobs.org/) at ** https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs/list/27814** and should include a cover letter, a curriculum vitae, research and teaching statements, and four letters of recommendation, at least one of which addresses teaching experience. In exceptional circumstances, letters of recommendation only may be mailed to:

Staffing Committee, Mathematics Department

Fordham University

441 E. Fordham Rd., Bronx, NY 10458.

To receive fullest consideration, applications should be complete by January 13, 2026, but applications will be reviewed until the position is filled. Fordham is not sponsoring H-1B visas for these positions.

### Adjunct Positions

The Department of Mathematics also seeks adjuncts to teach MATH 1100 and MATH 1108 in the Spring of 2025. If you are interested or would like further information about either position or about us, please email the chair A. Raghuram or the appropriate associate chair, Han-Bom Moon (Lincoln Center in Manhattan) or Rolf Ryham (Rose Hill in the Bronx).

### Diversity

Fordham’s 2020 [Diversity Action Plan](https://www.fordham.edu/info/30239/diversity_action_plan) commits it to addressing racism, educating for justice and pursuing greater diversity, equity, and inclusion across the University.

### Research

Although we are an undergraduate Department, our tenured and tenure-track faculty all have active research programs and an increasing number are supported by external grants. Our specialties include number theory, algebraic geometry, PDEs, dynamical systems, geometric measure theory, and probability theory.

### Teaching

Fordham’s educational mission is centered on a tradition of cura personalis, respect and care for the entire person. We believe that cultural and intellectual diversity is central to the excellence of our academic program and we welcome applications from individuals of all backgrounds. To tailor instruction to this tradition, classes are small (at most 25 students in courses in the Mathematics major and 35 in service courses). The normal load is 7.5 contact hours per semester (“3-2”), usually with at most 2 preparations. We thus expect that the number of hours which the candidate will devote to teaching will be comparable to that in similar junior positions in “2-2” departments. The Department offers B.Sc. and B.A. degrees in Mathematics, joint majors in Mathematics and Computer Science and in Mathematics and Economics, and participates in a 5-year Cooperative Program in Engineering (in collaboration with the departments of Physics and Chemistry and with Columbia and Case Western Reserve).

### Location

The primary teaching responsibilities of these two positions will be in the undergraduate program within Fordham College at Rose Hill in the Bronx, a beautiful 85-acre campus bordered by dynamic, diverse neighborhoods that characterize this legendary borough, the scenic New York Botanical Gardens, and the Wildlife Conservation Society’s world-renowned 265-acre Bronx Zoo. A second campus, Fordham College at Lincoln Center, is located in midtown Manhattan adjacent to the world-renowned Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and a block from Columbus Circle and Central Park. The University operates a fleet of express vans that connect the two campuses in 30 minutes and operate year-round 18-22 hours a day.

### Mathematics in the New York area

New York is one of the most important mathematical centers in the United States. Columbia University, New York University and the City University of New York are all located within 30 minutes of Fordham. Rutgers and Stony Brook can be reached in just under an hour by car or train and Princeton and Yale in just over an hour. The Department is generally able to arrange teaching schedules to allow faculty to attend seminars and courses in their specialty at these area institutions, and many members of the department actively collaborate with their faculty.
