# Medieval Studies Events

The Center for Medieval Studies sponsors many events throughout the year to encourage increased interest, knowledge, and study of the Middle Ages. Our [annual conferences](/academics/departments/medieval-studies/events/conferences/) highlight one theme per year and attract participants from all over the globe. Our Fall and Spring Lecture Series provide a forum for scholars in the field to come and present new material to the local medievalist community. We also host smaller symposia on specific scholarly questions, and run a series of [workshops on Professional Issues](/academics/departments/medieval-studies/events/symposia-and-workshops/) in Medieval Studies.

For more information on current events at the Center for Medieval Studies, follow us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MedievalStudiesFordham) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mvstfordham).
