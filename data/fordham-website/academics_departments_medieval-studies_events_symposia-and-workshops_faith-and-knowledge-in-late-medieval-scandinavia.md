## September 25th Fordham University, Lincoln Center Campus South Lounge of the Lowenstein Building

Heiðrún atop of Valhöll, SÁM 66.

1765-1766, Jakob Sigurðsson.

At this seminar we will investigate religious life in Late Medieval Scandinavia, in particular as it relates to how knowledge was perceived and attained. The absoluteness of the dichotomy between what we believe and what we know has always been dependent on context, and in the Late Middle Ages, the difference between the two was undergoing constant negotiation. This is probably due not only to an increase in sources, but also in voices, discourses, and questions actually raised. This seminar is dedicated to listening to those voices, and to trying to discern how they sought to answer questions that have constantly beset the human mind. The seminar is part of a book project.
