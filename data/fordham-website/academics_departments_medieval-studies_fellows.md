# Medieval Studies Fellows

The Center for Medieval Studies regularly hosts scholars in one of two programs:

The [Medieval Fellows program](/academics/departments/medieval-studies/fellows/medieval-fellows-program/) offers post-doctoral medievalists the opportunity to be affiliated with the Center for one to two semesters if they plan to reside in the New York City Area. Fellows are expected to attend Center events and participate in the intellectual life of the University during their residency.

[Visiting Fellows](/academics/departments/medieval-studies/fellows/visiting-fellows-program/) can be pre- or post-doctoral medievalist scholars in residence in New York City for shorter periods and up to one year.

Applicants need only submit one application in order to be considered for both of the Fellows Programs.

## Current Fellows

**Dr. Stefano Locatelli (Fellow 2025-2026)** is at Fordham University to work on a project entitled, "*Teaching with Money: Financial Literacy in Tuscan Abacus Manuals and Merchants’ Notebooks, 1202–1478"*, known by the more succinct acronym *EduMoney. *This project is funded by a three-year Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship. Based at the University of Milan, Dr Locatelli is a historian of late medieval Europe and the Mediterranean, who specializes in the monetary history of the Italian peninsula between 1200 and 1500. His project investigates the development of financial education in the late Middle Ages through a systematic, comparative, and digital analysis of a selected corpus of abacus books and merchant manuals – key pedagogical tools of the time –produced in late medieval Tuscany during a time of profound economic and financial transformation. At Fordham’s Center for Medieval Studies, Dr. Locatelli will collaborate with Professors Maryanne Kowaleski and Brian Reilly to create a digital manuscript database and to transcribe, translate, and analyze selected texts. The project aims to reconstruct the educational content of these historical sources and to explore how money was used as a pedagogical tool in medieval learning contexts.
