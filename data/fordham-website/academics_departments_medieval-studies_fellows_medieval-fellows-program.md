# Medieval Fellows Program

In 1996, the Center for Medieval Studies initiated a Medieval Fellows program, which offers post-doctoral scholars the benefits of post-graduate research affiliation with Fordham University during one or two semesters of research in the New York City area. The appointment carries no stipend, but Fellow status includes library privileges and a carrel, a research-oriented email account, use of the gym at faculty rates, participation in all seminars and functions in Medieval Studies, photocopy privileges, and program stationary.

Medieval Fellows and Visiting Medieval Fellows are expected to attend Center events during their term of residence and to abide by the regulations of those University facilities that he or she utilizes. Fellows are invited to participate fully in the Center's activities, including workshops, graduate prize competitions, and the annual Medieval Studies conference. In the last few years, one or more of the Fellows have served as judges for the graduate student essay prizes.

## How to Apply

Candidates wishing to apply for Fellow status submit the following to the Director, Center for Medieval Studies, FMH 405B, Fordham University, Bronx, NY 10458 (fax 718-817-3987) by June 1 of the academic year they wish their tenure to begin:

- A letter of application and intent to be in residence in or in the immediate vicinity of New York City for the stated duration of the candidate's request for affiliation.
- A succinct three- to four-page doubled-spaced description of the project or purpose for which the candidate is applying for status as a Fordham Medieval Fellow.
- A current
*curriculum vitae*. - Names, addresses, and email addresses of three referees

Announcements of the year's awards are in August; generally at least one but no more than three awards are made in any one academic year from a pool of applicants that numbers from three to seven each year. The Fellows come from a wide variety of disciplines and stages in their academic careers. Several of the Fellows have been recent PhD recipients from Fordham and other universities, one has been a full professor who wished to spend her sabbatical in New York City, while others have been mid-career scholars or academics from abroad. The Medieval Fellows program has drawn a wide range of post-doctoral scholars to Fordham for terms lasting from four months in the Fall (F) or Spring (S) semester, to the entire year (Y).
