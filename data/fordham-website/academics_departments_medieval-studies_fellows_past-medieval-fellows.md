# Past Medieval Fellows

## Fall 2023- Spring 2024

**Dr. Marianne Ailes** **(Fellow 2023)** is Professor of French at the University of Bristol. She has published extensively on crusading literature and the French of medieval England. An internationally known scholar of the *chanson de geste*, she is currently President of the International Société Rencesvals, and a former branch president of the British Branch. She led a major International Network project on Charlemagne: A European Icon which has resulted in 5 volumes to date with another still to be published. A co-authored book on The Charlemagne Legend in Medieval England, was a major output from the AHRC funded project on ‘Charlemagne in England’. She is currently holding a Leverhulme Fellowship to undertake research on positive representations of the religious Other in old French literature of the crusading world.

**Marija Blašković (Fellow 2023-2024) **was granted the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Fellowship in March 2023 for the project “Digitizing Women of Medieval Iberian Historiography” (FEMIber) at the University Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona. This fellowship is funded by the European Union. She also published an article entitled “[De la Historia de rebus Hispaniae a la Estoria de los godos y el Sumario Analístico: Constanza y Zaida entre tradiciones, discursos y contextos](https://doi.org/10.3989/aem.2022.52.2.03)” in *Anuario de Estudios Medievales* 52,2 (2022): 493-519, and her essay “The Search for an Heir: The Wives and Concubines of Alfonso VI (Twelfth–Fourteenth Centuries)” will soon be published in *Claiming Women’s Authority at Court and Convent in Medieval and Early Modern Spain*, a forthcoming volume edited by María Morrás and Vanessa de Cruz Medina. Marija also gave three papers in the past year: “Differentiating Kings by Differentiating Power in the Chronica Naierensis”, “Motherhood as a Prerequisite in Iberian Historiography?”, and “Steering away from Kings: Digital Prosopography of Women (14th-Century Iberia)”, which were presented at the 32nd Annual Conference of the Texas Medieval Association, an online workshop organized by the Noblewomen Network entitled “Children and Family Relationships”, and the 98th Annual Meeting of the Medieval Academy of America, respectively. Marija worked with Maryanne Kowaleski, whose experience with the Medieval Londoners digital project will enrich Marija’s FEMIber project.

**Dr. Jesse W. Izzo (Fellow 2023-2024) **spent a very enjoyable and highly productive academic year as a Visiting Fellow with the Center in 2023-24. In the fall he gave a public talk on the Rose Hill campus entitled “The Fall of ‘Crusader’ Acre Recontextualized: A New Approach to the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, c.1240-1291”. In December he recorded an episode of the CMS/Fordham DH-hosted “Crusader States Podcast” with Professor Nicholas Paul, in which they discussed an important source for the Latin East written by a curious figure referred to in scholarship only as the Templar of Tyre. Izzo also had the pleasure of regularly joining in with Professor Paul’s graduate seminar on the Crusader States. There and elsewhere on campus, Izzo greatly enjoined meeting the medieval MA and PhD students and hearing about their work. In the spring Izzo had the opportunity to chair a panel at the Courtly Literature: The Next Generation conference held at the Lincoln Center campus.

During the academic year Izzo also gave a paper at the California Medieval Seminar; had a review of the third edition of Jonathan Harris’s Byzantium and the Crusades published in the Medieval Review; and completed an article entitled “The Hospitallers and the Templars in the Arabic Sources: Attitudes and Perceptions”, which will appear in Military Orders VIII: In a Wider World (Routledge), edited by Emanuel Buttigieg and Clara Almagro Vidal. Another article, “The Comets of 1264 and 1299: A Comparative Look at the Near Eastern Sources,” will be published in August in The Crusades and Nature (Palgrave Macmillan/Springer), edited by Jessalyn Bird and Elizabeth Lapina. Finally, Izzo was able to draw on the resources, community, and time afforded by the Center during his visiting fellowship year to continue progress on his two current book projects. He is greatly appreciative of his experience at Fordham and looks forward to future professional and personal connections with the members of its community!

## Fall 2022-Spring 2023

**Dr. Marija Blašković (Visiting Fellow 2022-2023) **received her Doctorate in Spanish Philology from the University of Vienna in 2018 and has published articles on Latin and Romance historiography (12th-14th century). Much of her work is linked by an interest in cultural memory, identity construction, and the history of mentalities, as well as notions of power, knowledge, violence, and gender. She is currently a Beatriu de Pinós Fellow at the University Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona), where she will carry out her Digital Humanities project *Visualizing Women in Medieval Iberian Chronicles*. During her time at Fordham, she will be contributing to the project *Medieval Londoners *in order to learn more about digital prosopography. The skills she acquires will be used to create parameters for her own database on medieval Iberian women.

**Dr. Robin Reich (Fellow 2022-2023)** is a historian of medieval Mediterranean cross-cultural exchange through science and crafts. As a fellow, Dr. Reich is further developing her dissertation project, *Materials of Science in* *Norman Sicily: Translation, transmission, and trade in the central Mediterranean corridor*. This work explores scientific knowledge and its movement between Greek, Arabic, and Latin as a form of cultural exchange. Dr. Reich is also a co-founder of the Medievalist Toolkit, a public history initiative that aims to de-politicise uses of the medieval past and its legacy by providing public-oriented tools that encourage evidence-based discourse.

## Fall 2020 - Spring 2021

**Jane Gilbert** (Medieval Fellow, 2021-22) is Professor of Medieval Literature and Critical Theory at University College London, and works on medieval French and English literature. Her publications include *Medieval French Literary Culture Abroad* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2020), co-authored with Simon Gaunt and William Burgwinkle. During her Fellowship she will be working on two articles relating to her current research project, which is on literary form in translation: one on the aggressive sonic effects of linguistic and formal code-switching, the other on the use of brackets in medieval verse manuscripts (‘poetic braces’).

**Jennifer C. Edwards** (Medieval Fellow, 2020-2021) is a Professor of Ancient and Medieval History at Manhattan College. As a fellow, Dr. Edwards will be pursuing work on her second book project, *Holy Healing: Saints and Leprosy in the Middle Ages*, which will examine saints' treatment of leprosy in Medieval Europe. This project expands upon her examination of religious communities in her first book, *Superior Women: Medieval Female Authority in Poitiers' Abbey of Sainte-Croix* (Oxford, 2019), which was a co-runner up for the Society for Feminist Scholarship 2020 Book Prize.

## Fall 2019 - Spring 2020

**William Edwards** (Visiting Fellow, 2019-2020) is currently completing a Ph.D. in History at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.

**Dr. Sian Ricketts** (Medieval Fellow, 2019-2020) received the Doctor of Musical Arts in Historical Performance from Case Western Reserve University in 2015 and has studied to a high level of proficiency in the performance of numerous historical instruments. In addition to teaching and making presentations at high schools and colleges in the metropolitan area, Dr. Ricketts is a founding member of the early music performance troupe Alkemie, and performed at a major event at Fordham in Spring 2019. Dr. Ricketts will be coming to Fordham in 2019-2020 as part of a team with Dr. Tracey Cowart to lead the Collegium Musicum Fordhamense and teach classes.

**Dr. Tracey Cowart** (Medieval Fellow, 2019-2020) received her Doctorate in Musical Arts in Historical Performance from Case Western Reserve University in 2014 and has performed several significant research recitals. As a founding member of the early music ensemble Alkemie she has participated in dozens of performances, including the event at Fordham in Spring 2019. Like Dr. Ricketts, Dr. Cowart will be teaching and leading the Collegium Musicum Fordhamense, and will use her fellowship as an opportunity both to pursue her own research and also to ground her performances in a larger context.

## Fall 2018 - Spring 2019

**Jay Diehl **(2018-2019) received his Ph.D. at NYU and is currently associate professor of History at Long Island University.

She recently co-edited *Resident Aliens in Later Medieval England *(2017).

**Jesse Abelman **(2018-2019) is currently finishing his doctorate at Yeshiva University. The focus of his research is medieval Jewish law and his dissertation considers violence and conflict resolution within Europe Jewish communities, but also compares the function of law in Jewish courts with similar cases in the courts of Christian Europe.

**Erik Claeson **(2018-2019) is a doctoral student in Practical Theology at Lund University in Sweden. His research concerns medieval sermons on saints from the Swedish Abbey of Vadstena, founded by St. Birgitta of Sweden in 1384, and he focuses on 80 sermons written in Latin for the feast days of St. Birgitta, St. Erik, and St. Botolph composed around 1380-1510.

Dr. Kertz received her Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in September 2016.

**2017 (Spring, Visiting Fellow) Melanie Hanan**

![Hanan](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/Melanie_Hanan.jpg)

Dr. Hanan received her Ph.D. from the Institute of Fine Arts at NYU in May 2013.

## Fall 2016

**2016-2017 (Fall-Spring, Medieval Fellow) John P. McCaskey**

![McCaskey](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/John_McCaskey.jpg)

John P. McCaskey has been the university's Medieval Fellow for 2016-17. A graduate of Stanford University, McCaskey has taught there, at Brown University, and at Columbia University and is the editor and translator of Jacopo Zabarella's *On Methods* and *On Regressus* for Harvard University Press's I Tatti Renaissance Library. For several years he has been researching, writing, and speaking about the history of philosophical induction. On December 6, he introduced this research to the Fordham community in a talk, "*Inductio*: The Medieval Transmission and Humanist Solution to the 'Scandal of Philosophy.'" He is using his time in the Center for Medieval Studies to complete a book on his findings. His main discovery is that a conception of induction that flourished in the ancient world and that was rediscovered by humanists in the fifteen century appears to avoid many of the problems of induction that philosophers of recent centuries have struggled with. Over the years McCaskey has also been a contributor to the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and while at the Center he has been a resource for some digital humanities projects at Fordham.
