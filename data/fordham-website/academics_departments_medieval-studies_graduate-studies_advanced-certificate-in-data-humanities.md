The program begins with a foundational seminar in data humanities. Expertise in a humanities field is obtained through one (1) required source-based course; relevant proficiency in data science is obtained through one (1) data methods course. Additional electives in either domain may be taken to complete the required fifteen (15) credits. Additionally, a capstone project will synthesize these skills, contributing to the student’s academic portfolio. For those without prior experience in programming or statistics, the introductory course ensures the preparation needed for advanced methods coursework.

### F.A.Q.

-
This certificate will be of interest to individuals who work with cultural data. The program would be most ideal for: post-baccalaureate humanities majors seeking to enhance existing degrees with cutting-edge methods to prepare for graduate study; current graduate humanities students looking to incorporate data scientific methodologies into humanities research and gain competitive advantages for doctoral applications and expanded career opportunities in academic and alt-ac markets; data professionals interested in field-specific expertise for arts, culture, and heritage sector roles; and cultural sector professionals hoping to reskill or advance careers in libraries, archives, museums, and cultural organizations.

-
The Advanced Certificate in Data Humanities is designed to foster significant intellectual and professional growth, preparing certificate holders to navigate and shape the evolving landscape of cultural inquiry and data-driven understanding. Students who pursue this certificate will gain interdisciplinary fluency, critical algorithmic literacy, and the ability to apply data-driven interpretation to complex humanities questions. Professionally, they will be highly employable, capable of career diversification, and serve as vital translational leaders in cultural institutions and beyond. They will also be at the forefront of ethical scholarship in the digital age, shaping how AI is responsibly used to preserve and interpret human culture.

-
Certificate holders will emerge as data humanists—distinct from data scientists—uniquely trained to bridge the gap between computational methods and humanistic inquiry.

Certificate holders will:

**Specialize in a particular humanities field**by taking at least one course focused on sources specific to that field (e.g., a History course on archives, an English course on paleography, an American Studies course on testimony, or a Theater course on repertoire).**Gain proficiency in data scientific tools**to explore these sources as data, through at least one course on data methods (e.g., programming in Python, data visualization, or databases).
