**We wear many hats!**

### Professional Issues Workshops

The Center for Medieval Studies regularly sponsors graduate student workshops that cover a variety of topics of interest to graduate students seeking career and professional advice. Past workshops have treated such themes as how to put together an academic curriculum vitae; how to write an abstract for a scholarly conference; and a series on compatible careers, which invited past graduates to discuss non-university professions open to those with M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in the Humanities.
