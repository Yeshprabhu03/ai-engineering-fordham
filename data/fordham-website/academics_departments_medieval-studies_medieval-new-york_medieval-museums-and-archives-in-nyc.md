New York City and its environs are blessed with an impressive number of museums, libraries, and archives that have medieval holdings, including those listed here.

The Cloisters Museum and Gardens contains the bulk of the medieval holdings of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, including architectural elements, sculpture, tapestries, paintings, enamels, stained glass, and metalwork; the collection is especially strong in the religious art of the high to late middle ages. The building, which incorporates columns and other elements (including chapels and a chapter house) from five medieval monasteries, sits on four acres of gardens and park overlooking the Hudson River. Medieval gardens have been placed within the three reconstructed medieval monastic cloisters. The Cloisters hosts special exhibitions, lectures, gallery talks, concerts, and performances.
