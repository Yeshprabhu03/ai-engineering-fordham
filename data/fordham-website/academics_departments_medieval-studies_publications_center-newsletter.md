# Medieval Studies Center Newsletter

Each year, the Center for Medieval Studies publishes *Medievalia Fordhamensia*, a newsletter for medievalists in the Fordham community. The newsletter announces upcoming lectures and conferences, as well as new courses; introduces new faculty members and Medieval Fellows to its readership; offers updates about the recent publications, scholarly talks, and grants awarded to Fordham faculty and graduate students; and prints a variety of other news of interest to medievalists at Fordham.
