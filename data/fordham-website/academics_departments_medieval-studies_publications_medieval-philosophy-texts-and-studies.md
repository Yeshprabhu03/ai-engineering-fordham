# Medieval Philosophy: Texts and Studies

Focusing on the rich tradition of medieval philosophy, this series will publish single-author books, multi-author collections, commentaries, translations, and bilingual and original critical texts.

It will cover the full range of philosophical disciplines as medieval authors addressed them:

- Logic
- Epistemology
- Philosophy of nature
- Philosophy of the soul
- Metaphysics
- Moral philosophy
- Political philosophy

Volumes in the series will be especially concerned to trace both the distinctive conceptual cohesion and the immense diversity to be found in medieval philosophical thinking. As well as exploring its impact on early modern thought, they will consider how it can directly enhance our contemporary understanding of fundamental philosophical questions. The series, therefore, will be of interest not only to specialists in medieval philosophy but also to contemporary philosophers working in any major field, as well as to anyone in the humanities interested in a historically informed philosophical view of his or her subject. Volumes in the series should provide excellent course adoptions for graduate teaching and research.
