# Study Tour: Medieval Spain

![Camino 2020 Group](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/Camino_Santiago_2020_3.jpg)

Fordham's 2020 Camino class arrives in Santiago.

The Camino de Santiago is the traditional pilgrimage route from France across northwestern Spain to Santiago de Compostela, the legendary burial site of St. James. One of the great medieval pilgrimages and the greatest surviving itinerary for medieval monuments and landscapes, it has enjoyed a remarkable revival in recent years, attracting European Union sponsorship, the attention of media stars, and hundreds of thousands of walkers and pilgrims.

In this spring course, two-week study tour, and interdisciplinary capstone, participants will walk the route, and meet each day for lectures and discussion of the medieval and pre-modern monuments along the route. The group will meet periodically during the spring semester to discuss reading assignments, make presentations and prepare for the walk. A final project is required at the end of the course.

Fordham College students may gain four credits for this course and may apply the credits earned for this course (MVST 4998) to meet the ICC requirement, EP3 requirement, as a free elective (no matter what their major), or toward majors/minors in Medieval Studies, History, Latin American and Latino Studies, and American Catholic Studies.

Eligibility requires that students be full-time and registered during the spring semester. Participation in this study tour can then be added to their schedules for a total not exceeding 18 credits without further tuition charges.

**About the Walk**People of all ages and physical conditions have walked the Camino de Santiago, and anyone in average shape should be able to complete it. Some parts of the route can be demanding, with passage through occasionally mountainous terrain. This indeed is part of the attraction for many. Students should, however, contact their physicians at least three months prior to travel. All questions about medical advice should be addressed to your physician. Students and families should be assured that Spain has an advanced and extensive medical care system, and professionally staffed clinics are available in most towns and cities along the route and throughout the country.

Participants will also meet regularly during the semester to walk in preparation. Each participant will need to sign up for at least 2 weekend walks (either to City Island, about 12 miles total, or from the Lincoln Center Campus to Rose Hill along the Hudson River, about 13 miles total).

-
The course meets every other week during the Spring semester for discussions and lectures on medieval pilgrimage and religion, modern experiences of pilgrimage, and practical matters relating to the walk.
