Fordham University offers both a [major](/academics/departments/music/degrees-and-curriculum/major/) and a [minor](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/undergraduate/music/minor/) in Music. Students are encouraged to explore the depths of their talents while pursuing their degree, all while cultivating their critical thinking and analysis skills through a rigorous Liberal Arts education.

**At the conclusion of their studies, our majors and minors will:**

-
Possess strong listening skills, and be able to explain verbally and in prose what they have heard.


-
Understand theory fundamentals, including rhythm, harmony, and compositional forms.


-
Understand and describe music as part of systems of culture that give sounds their meanings.


-
Through experience in faculty-coached ensembles, learn to balance individual effort with communal achievement.


-
Possess strong critical thinking skills and writing skills, applicable both to music and beyond.
