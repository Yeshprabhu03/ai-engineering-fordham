### Biography

Composer Daniel Ott's music has been described as "haunting" (*The News Tribune*), "compelling" (*Dance Magazine*), and "of considerable artistic seriousness" (*MusicWeb International*). His work has been heard all over the world, most notably at Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, the Kennedy Center, Sadler's Wells, the Musée du Louvre, the Guggenheim Museum, and at the Fall for Dance Festival in New York's City Center. Recent commissions have come from the National Symphony, New York City Ballet, the Chiara Quartet, and Bargemusic, among others.


Noted for his work for dance, Ott has composed a number of ballet scores, most recently for the New York City Ballet Choreographic Institute's 10th Anniversary at Miller Theatre in New York. In a unique experiment, the resulting work, *An Inflorescence*, was set to dance by three of the world's leading choreographers--Larry Kiegwin, Alexei Ratmansky, and Christopher Wheeldon--and performed three times in one evening. Ott has also been a frequent collaborator with Benjamin Millepied, from whom he has received a number of commissions. Their *Double Aria* was described as the "highlight of the night" (*The New York Times*) at its NYCB premiere.


Other recent projects have included the premiere of Ott's String Quartet No. 2 by the Chiara Quartet, as part of their innovative Creator/Curator commissioning series, in which the composer selects the other works to appear alongside his music. Ott's *Blue Water*, a chamber concerto for violin, piano, and string quartet, whose music "weaves together images of magnificence and terror" (*The New York Times*), was commissioned for Bargemusic's 30th Anniversary and premiered by the Shanghai Quartet and guests.

Ott has been recognized numerous times for his work, in particular by the American Academy of Arts and Letters (Charles Ives Scholarship) and the ASCAP Foundation (Morton Gould Young Composer Award). He studied at the Curtis Institute of Music and the Juilliard School, where his teachers included Ned Rorem, John Corigliano, and Robert Beaser. Ott currently serves on the faculty of both Fordham and Juilliard.
