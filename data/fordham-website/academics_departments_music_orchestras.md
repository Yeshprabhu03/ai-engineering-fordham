Considered one of the most outstanding universities in the United States, Fordham University provides two larger ensemble opportunities for their students on two New York City campuses. These are the Fordham University Symphony Orchestra (FUSO) and the Lincoln Center Chamber Orchestra (LCCO). FUSO is a collaboration of the Art History and Music Department and the university's student-run organizations. It is comprised mainly of non-music performance majors. Students who have reached a high level of musicianship and want to pursue a liberal arts education fit right into the university’s orchestras, alongside those who are pursuing music studies.

The members of the orchestra frequently engage in sectional workshops and coaching with international performers and ‘Artist Teachers’ active in the musical community. Most recently they have included Brian Hong, artistic director of Nexus Chamber Music, Benjamin Fingland, and Jessica Meyer of Counter) induction, Wilden Dannenberg of the Deep Roots Ensemble, and members of the Parallel Brass Ensemble.
