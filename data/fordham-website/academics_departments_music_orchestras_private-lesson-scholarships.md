# Private Lesson Scholarship Guidelines

- Students interested in lesson scholarships should email Dr. Bhasin stating their interest in applying and learning about the next steps in the process. Lesson scholarships shall be awarded by the Director (in consultation with Music Department Faculty and the Director of the Jazz Orchestra) based on competitive audition.
- The Director shall provide a list of winners to the Music Dept. no later than March. Awardees shall be excluded from holding a lesson scholarship from the Music Dept. in the same year.
- Participation in Pep Band, Commencement, and Encaenia will be considered among the criteria.
- Formal registration in FUSO, LCCO, or Jazz Orchestra is required; students must use their award in the academic year for which it was awarded.
- Students who do not use their award cannot carry it over to the next academic year; in addition, they will be ineligible to audition the following year.
- Funds will be awarded soon after the first rehearsal for Commencement and Encaenia ceremonies.
