![Afro-Latin Ensemble](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/music/Afro_Latin_Ensemble.jpg)

The Afro-Latin Music Ensemble (MUSC 1302) focuses on traditional and popular music mainly from Ecuador and Colombia as well as popular Afro-Latin rhythms from across Latin America and the Caribbean.

Afro-Colombian and Afro-Ecuadorian musics include a variety of instruments such as hand drums, bass drums, shakers, guitar, and the marimba, all of which accompanies call-and-response singing. As Afro-Caribbean music is pervasive throughout the region and incorporated into traditional styles as well, students will also learn the fundamentals of various Latin American Instrumental techniques. The ensemble focuses on participatory music, so beginners are encouraged to join and play, while experienced musicians will still be able to advance their own techniques.

The ensemble is led by Juan Montoya. The ensemble usually meets on Tuesday evenings at Lincoln Center.
