## Celebrating Student Achievement, Empowered by Professor Hamilton’s Generosity

We are delighted to invite you to the **Mary G. Hamilton Research Symposium** on **November 6th at 11:45 a.m.** in the **12th Floor Lounge, Lowenstein Building**.

Each year, the Department of Natural Sciences at Fordham College at Lincoln Center highlights the outstanding accomplishments of our undergraduate students through this symposium, where our majors present the results of their research.

This celebration of student scholarship is also an occasion to recognize the extraordinary generosity of **Professor Dr. Mary G. Hamilton**, whose personal support has made a profound difference in the lives of dozens of students. Through her sponsorship of summer research awards, Dr. Hamilton has provided opportunities that inspire discovery, curiosity, and academic growth. While no words can fully capture our gratitude, it is our honor to name this annual symposium after her as a lasting tribute to her dedication.

At the heart of the Department of Natural Sciences is a commitment to **student-focused research and undergraduate education**. We hope you will join us in celebrating the hard work and achievements of our students, and in honoring the generosity that continues to make their success possible.
