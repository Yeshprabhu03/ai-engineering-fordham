### Genetics of Development research

I have spent my career studying the genetic control of development. As a graduate, student, I earned my Ph.D. studying the genetic control of the dauer fate decision in

*C.*elegans *,*which led me to my work on cloning the dauerdevelopemt /life span regulator,*age-1*. As a post-doc, I worked on genes required for oogenesis in Drosophila., and I followed up on several of those genes in my own lab, along with my undergraduate collaborators, at Fordham College at Lincoln Center. My lab is currently focused on the gene*fried*, which encodes a HEAT Repeat protein.*fried*mutants wander off their food source precociously and die as larvae. We have used CRISPR to insert a tag into the endogenous*fried*gene and we are currently determining the expression pattern and subcellular localization of the protein*fried*encodes.### Ethics research

I have worked on two ethics projects. The first is

pair of papers discussing why substance ontology cannot be used to assign moral status to the early stages of human development. The second is a pair of publications I coauthored with my wife, Marilyn Morris, on how Internal Review Boards might better function if they were organized according to Virtue Ethics principles. -
