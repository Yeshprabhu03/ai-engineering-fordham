I received my Bachelor's in Chemistry from Queens College, CUNY, my Master's and Phd degrees from the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.

The focus of the Thomas research lab is the synthesis and characterization of ionic liquids for environmental remediation. Past studies focused on the use of ionic liquids for the processing of the biorenewable polymer cellulose. With our collaborator Dr. Ipsita Banerjee in the Department of Chemistry at FCRH, we're developing ion gels (ionic liquid hybrid materials) that could be used to purify petroleum fuels. We are also working with Dr. Alma Rodenas-Ruano at FCLC, to study the impact of ionic liquids on neuronal development and behavior of marine organisms such as zebrafish and horseshoe crabs.
