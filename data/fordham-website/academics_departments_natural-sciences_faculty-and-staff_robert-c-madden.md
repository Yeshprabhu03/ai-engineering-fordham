My primary interest is the sensory basis for animal orientation in space and time. Survival of animals depends on their doing the right thing in the right place at the right time. Various neural and sensory mechanisms assure that this occurs. I have worked with a variety of animal species including honeybees, fruit flies, carpenter ants, black-legged ticks (carrier of Lyme disease), homing pigeons, hamsters, pigmy opossums, and flying squirrels. My present work is carried out on invertebrates, with honeybees being my currently most active species. All of these animals present interesting opportunities for studying spatial and temporal orientation. I have a secondary interest in experimental design and data analysis. My original interest in this resulted from the fact that animal orientation data can present complex analysis problems. After I acquired skill in this area, I found myself collaborating with other researchers on problems of data analysis, sometimes in fields not closely related to my main interest.
