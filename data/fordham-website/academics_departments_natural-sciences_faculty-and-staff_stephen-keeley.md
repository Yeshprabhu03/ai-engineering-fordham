Keeley received Bachelor's degrees in physics and neuroscience from the University of Rochester, his Ph.D. from the Center for Neural Science at New York University, and did his postdoctoral work at Princeton University.

-
My lab develops new machine learning and statistical methods to help understand neural processing and behavior. We work with collaborators from institutes around the world to analyze real neural datasets recorded in a variety of experimental settings and animal models, including datasets from flies, rodents, and humans. Current research topics include latent variable models, dimensionality reduction, neural dynamical systems, multi-region neural communication and human decision-making.
