Founded in 2003, the **Center for the Study of Scottish Philosophy (CSSP)** exists to promote and extend interest in the Scottish philosophical tradition. In addition to supporting existing scholarship on core figures, themes, and texts, the CSSP also aims to:

- Extend interest in Scottish philosophy beyond the traditional period and figures of the Scottish Enlightenment
- Explore the global impact of the Scottish philosophical tradition
- Recover the resources of the tradition for engagement with present-day philosophical research
- Support emerging and early-career scholars with mentorship programs and modest funding to attend CSSP events and conferences

Scholars and students of Scottish philosophy are [invited to become a member of the CSSP](https://www.euppublishing.com/page/jsp/subscribe), and to [register for email newsletters](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8eedfdfdfecee8e1fceae6efe3a0ebeafb).
