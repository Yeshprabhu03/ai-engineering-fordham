# About the Center for the Study of Scottish Philosophy

In 1997 the University of Aberdeen in Scotland established ‘The Reid Project’ with the purpose of encouraging the study of the Scottish Enlightenment philosopher Thomas Reid (1710-96) who taught philosophy at King’s College Aberdeen in the 18th century. In 2003 The Reid Project was expanded into an established **Center for the Study of Scottish Philosophy (CSSP)**. Under its auspices, the * Journal of Scottish Philosophy* was founded, a book series launched, and a number of meetings and conferences organized.

In Spring 2006, the CSSP relocated to Princeton Theological Seminary and expanded its activities. The *Journal of Scottish Philosophy* continued to be published by Edinburgh University Press on behalf of the CSSP and Princeton Theological Seminary. Many volumes were added to the Library of Scottish Philosophy and the conference and workshop program was continued and extended. The CSSP also initiated a multi-authored, multi-volume history of Scottish philosophy, the first volumes of which were published by Oxford University Press in 2015.

The CSSP was directed by Gordon Graham, Henry Luce III Professor of Philosophy and the Arts at Princeton Seminary until Spring 2018. He was founding editor of the *Journal of Scottish Philosophy*, Series Editor of the Library of Scottish Philosophy, and General Editor of the Oxford History of Scottish Philosophy.

In April of 2018, the CSSP merged with the International Association for Scottish Philosophy to form the Institute for the Study of Scottish Philosophy (ISSP) at the University of Sioux Falls, directed by Dr. James Foster. With EUP, ISSP continued to publish the *Journal of Scottish Philosophy* and to schedule yearly conferences.

In September of 2024, the ISSP returned to its former name, the Center for the Study of Scottish Philosophy, and moved to Fordham University in New York, under the direction of Dr. Lauren Kopajtic. The CSSP will continue to publish the *Journal of Scottish Philosophy* through Edinburgh University Press, and to schedule regular workshops and conferences.
