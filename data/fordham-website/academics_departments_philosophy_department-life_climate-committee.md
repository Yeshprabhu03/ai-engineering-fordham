### Some facts about implicit bias

Implicit bias is a form of bias against members of a group just because they are such members. It is ‘implicit’ because it consists of unconscious attitudes and actions; it might even be contrary to the same person’s explicit beliefs about the same group. Because of this, it is difficult to self-diagnose.

Examples of implicit bias include:

- When writing recommendation letters, an advisor uses different language when writing for a woman than when writing for a man. According to some statistics, instructors tend to focus on the ability to work hard in the former case, while they focus more on accomplishments and promise in the latter case.
- When an instructor does not notice that a member of a minority group would like to say something in class.
- When a member of a minority group makes a point mostly unnoticed, and the same point gets attention when proposed by a non-minority person.
- When an instructor has slightly different policies of classroom behavior for the minority students.
- Be aware of it so that you can avoid the situations in which you would exhibit it.

What should I do about implicit bias?

- Seek out practical advice; here are answers to some FAQs:

### Some facts about stereotype threat

Stereotype threat occurs when an individual is in a situation to confirm a negative stereotype of a group to which he or she belongs. Such situations can interfere with the individual’s performance.

Examples of stereotype threat situations include:

- When a test is introduced as to measure analytic ability, black test takers tend to perform better than whites. When the same test is not introduced this way, their performance is equal.
- Even young children can experience stereotype threat: when young girls are introduced to a test as measuring mathematical abilities, they perform worse than when they are not introduced to it this way.

What can I do about stereotype threats?

- Introduce tasks so that they are unlikely to create stereotype threat scenarios.
- When speaking about excellence, make sure to include examples from diverse groups.
- Reject the stereotype explicitly.

- Harvard’s
[implicit bias test](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html)(strongly recommended). At this site one may privately take a test that will indicate where one’s own implicit attitudes are such that bias is present. It is rare that no biases are unearthed, and so it is a helpful tool for self-understanding for all members of a community. - A collection of philosophical readings related to implicit bias:

Climate problems can and do arise in most institutions, and both the department and the university have various ways to resolve these problems.
