# Fordham Philosophical Society

**About us**

Created and organized by students, the Fordham Philosophical Society (FPS) seeks, as its main purpose, to foster the professional development of students in the philosophy program. Our mission is to support and further the scholarly endeavors of students through a variety of established programs and activities, including topical and historical reading groups, biennial graduate philosophy conferences, and biannual symposia.

Our aim is not only to facilitate progress through the academic programs leading to the conferment of MA and PhD degrees in philosophy, but also to enable the individual student to pursue and meet his or her personal, professional and scholarly goals, including publication and professional presentation.

The FPS provides a forum for social and academic community among students and a link to the faculty, acting as liaison especially to the department chairperson and the graduate director.

Acting closely with the department and University administrators, the FPS provides a voice to its graduate students, whereby concerns, problems, and suggestions may be brought to the appropriate forum for discussion. Finally, through the establishment of reading groups, symposia series, conferences, etc., the FPS seeks to open an avenue for ever greater scholarly and intellectual exchange between students and faculty in the hope of creating and sustaining a true community of philosophical discourse.
