# Sullivan Lecturers

## Sullivan Lecture Series, Fordham University

The Daniel J. Sullivan Memorial Lecture Series was inaugurated in the Spring of 1986 to honor an outstanding professor of philosophy whose talents as a teacher and administrator were wholeheartedly put at the service of Downtown Fordham from 1936 until his death in 1984. Professor Sullivan's warm, loving personality, as well as his moral integrity and dedication to his vocation endeared him to generations of students and colleagues. He was the author of two well known textbooks, *Fundamentals of Logic* and *Introduction to Philosophy.* The lecture was co-sponsored for many years by the Philosophy Department and Fordham's Jesuit Community with the aid of a fund established in Sullivan's honor. It has been sponsored by the Philosophy Department since fall 2010.
