## July 12 - 24, 2026

[Apply now for the summer program](https://form.jotform.com/260265828389167)

Current high school juniors from across the Bronx are invited to apply for a free, three-week seminar taking place this July on the historic Rose Hill campus of Fordham University.

The **Visions of the Good in the Bronx** seminar will introduce intellectually curious students to college-level work in the humanities and prepare them for flourishing lives as responsible citizens. It will focus on questions of central importance to every human being, including:

How should I live?

What do we owe to each other?

What can I become?

Students will live on campus during the free seminar, receive a stipend for their participation, and learn from Fordham University professors. The summer program will be followed by a year-long mentoring program where students reinforce essential life and college-readiness skills, and successful students will receive letters of recommendation from their summer professors to accompany their college applications. Applications are open to all, but we especially seek students who are from low-income households and/or will be the first in their families to attend college in the United States.

**Applications are due by no later than March 25, 2026.**

Visions of the Good in the Bronx is made possible by a generous grant from the Teagle Foundation as part of their ["Knowledge for Freedom"](https://www.teaglefoundation.org/Call-for-Proposals/Initiatives/Knowledge-For-Freedom) initiative.
