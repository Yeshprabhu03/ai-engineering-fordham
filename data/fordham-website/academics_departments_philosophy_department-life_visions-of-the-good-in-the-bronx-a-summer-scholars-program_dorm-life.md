## Living on Campus

Students will reside in Tierney Hall on Fordham’s Rose Hill Campus in the Bronx. The dorm features double rooms with individual bathrooms per floor. Students are supervised by undergraduate Residential Teaching Advisors (RTAs) who live in the dorms with the students.

*Students sleep in the dorms on Sunday - Thursday nights, and return home on Friday and Saturday.*
