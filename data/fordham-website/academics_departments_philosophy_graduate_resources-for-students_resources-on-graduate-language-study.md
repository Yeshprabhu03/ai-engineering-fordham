Fordham Student Support Grants

Activities supported: Research, Language, etc.

Overview: [Student Support Grants](https://www.fordham.edu/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/financial-support/graduate-student-support-grant/program-information-and-award-types/) award up to $2,000 for conference participation, research, or

alternative learning experiences. One may propose a language course or language immersion

program as an alternative learning experience. Consult the [SSG Fact Sheet](https://www.fordham.edu/media/home/schools/graduate-school-of-arts-sciences/pdfs/SSG-Fact-Sheet-1.pdf) for more information.

NB: In principle, Student Support Grants can be used for language training. However, SSGs

often demand ardent justification. One ought to explain and justify that the fluency/training

needed for the target language cannot be satisfied by Fordham’s current of erings. Consult

examples of previously funded SSG proposals [here](https://www.fordham.edu/media/home/schools/graduate-school-of-arts-sciences/pdfs/SSG-Previously-Funded-Application-Examples-Spring-2023.pdf).
