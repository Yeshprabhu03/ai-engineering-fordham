Giorgio Pini's area of specialization is medieval philosophy. His research focuses on the metaphysics, theories of cognition, and philosophical theology of John Duns Scotus and other later medieval thinkers, including Thomas Aquinas, Henry of Ghent, Giles of Rome, and Godfrey of Fontaines. He has an ongoing interest in Augustine and a growing interest in Anselm of Canterbury. He is currently working on a monograph on Duns Scotus's metaphysics.

In addition to the history of philosophy, his expertise and interests extend to textual scholarship. In 2017, his critical edition of John Duns Scotus's
