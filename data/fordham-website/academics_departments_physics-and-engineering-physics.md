From the smallest quarks to the largest galaxies, physics allows us insight into how everything around us works. While we are a purely undergraduate department, we have strived to give our students the best education in physics and engineering physics possible. As a small department we can devote ourselves to providing a strong education for all of our students. We strive to share our interest and excitement in physics and engineering physics with our nearly 100 undergraduates.

Within our department, our faculty and many of our students are involved in research in the following fields:

- Applied Optics
- Astrophysics
- Condensed Matter Physics (theory and experiment)
- High Energy Particle Theory
- Medical Physics
- Molecular and Nanoelectronic device modeling
- Nuclear Theory
- Polymer Physics
- Seismology

Believing in the value of research for undergraduates, we encourage our students to actively participate in faculty research groups. Check out what is going on in our department, or just pop by Freeman Hall and say hello!
