The physics department prepares students for a wide variety of technical careers. We offer three distinct programs of study and two minors.

- The
[physics major](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/undergraduate/physics-engineering/physics-major)provides students with a solid physics foundation with advanced courses in physics. It primarily prepares students for graduate study in physics, however students could pursue other graduate degrees in, for example, architecture, business, finance, law, medicine, or secondary education. Additionally, physics majors are in high demand in many careers straight out of college. - The e
[ngineering physics major](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/undergraduate/physics-engineering/engineering-physics-major/)builds on the same physics foundation and gives students a direct focus in one of various concentrations in a related applied field. Such students can pursue many of the same post-college goals that the physics majors do, but have a more applied background for those who plan to pursue a career in industry or to attend graduate school in engineering. - The
[3-2 Cooperative Program](/academics/departments/physics-and-engineering-physics/curriculum/3-2-cooperative-program-in-engineering/)in Engineering includes three years at Fordham followed by two years at an engineering school (either Columbia University or Case Western Reserve University) resulting in a double major. The student will obtain a bachelor's degree in physics and a bachelor's degree in a subfield of engineering of the student's choice.
