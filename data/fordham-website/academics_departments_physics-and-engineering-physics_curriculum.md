# Physics and Engineering Physics Curriculum

Most students begin their courses in Physics or Engineering Physics beginning either their Freshman or Sophomore year. Students who are interested in beginning a major during his/her junior year would require an additional year at Fordham, unless some of the requirements have already been taken.

The first two years of courses are generally the same for both physics and engineering physics majors, and we show sample curricula for individual programs:

Additionally, the first two years are generally the same if a student wishes to pursue the [3-2 engineering program](/academics/departments/physics-and-engineering-physics/curriculum/3-2-cooperative-program-in-engineering/).
