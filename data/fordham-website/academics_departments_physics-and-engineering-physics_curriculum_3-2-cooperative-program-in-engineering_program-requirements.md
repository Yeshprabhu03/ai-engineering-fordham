# Program Requirements

## Required courses

For the Combined Plan with Columbia, you can find specific requirements in the following documents. They list specific requirements that must be fulfilled as a Fordham student, depending on when the student began taking classes at Fordham.

Additionally, to see what Fordham courses correspond to those courses in these guides, please see this [Curriculum Guide](https://caubin.ace.fordham.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Fordham32CurriculumGuide2025.pdf).

Please note that acceptance to Columbia with this program is not guaranteed, even if all requirements are met. Learn more about the [Combined Plan with Case Western Reserve University](https://engineering.case.edu/academics/dual-degree-program).

Generally, for both programs, *all* students are required to take the following courses while at Fordham:

MATH 1206 (Calculus I)

MATH 1207 (Calculus II)

MATH 2008 (Vector Calculus)

PHYS 1601 & 1603 *or *1701 & 1703 (Intro Physics I or Physics I)

PHYS 1602 & 1604 *or *1702 & 1704 (Intro Physics II or Physics II)

PHYS 1511 (Physics I Lab)

PHYS 1512 (Physics II Lab)

CHEM 1311, 1321, & 1331 (General Chemistry I + Lab)

Computer Science: Either CISC 1600 & 1610 (Computer Science I + Lab) or other classes teaching specific languages as required by the engineering major chosen

ECON 1010 (Basic Microeconomics, recommended) *or* ECON 1020 (Basic Macroeconomics) – this should be the course taken for the Social Science Core

The other requirements are automatically satisfied by the Fordham core curriculum. Columbia does not accept transfer credits from online courses,** this means that no courses may be taken online (core, major, or 3-2 requirements) for students in this program.**

Note that some of the specific majors at the other school will have slightly different requirements, so while this is a good list to work from, be sure to check the specific requirements above.

In order to ensure academic success, a student may be withdrawn from the 3-2 program by the director in the following instances.

- If the student is not making sufficiently adequate progress towards a transfer to Columbia or Case Western Reserve, for example: their cumulative GPA is below a 3.0, grades in more than four pre-engineering required classes are below a B, or they have not taken enough pre-engineering requirements by the end of each academic year.
- If the student has not declared one of the required majors before the end of their first year (physics, engineering physics, chemistry, mathematics, computer science, or the joint math-cis major).
- If the student does not apply for transfer by the deadline during their junior year.

Removal from the program merely means the student will be expected to finish their four years at Fordham, and then with the help of the director, can find alternative paths to a career in engineering.
