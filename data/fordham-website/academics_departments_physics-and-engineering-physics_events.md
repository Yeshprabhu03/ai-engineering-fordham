# Physics and Engineering Physics Events

The department hosts colloquia from outside speakers on a regular basis. Additionally, current undergraduates (generally in the fall semester) give talks on research they have worked on. These talks and other departmental events will be posted here regularly.

Dennis W. Marks, Ph.D., FCRH ’66

Professor Emeritus and Head of Department of Physics, Astronomy, and Geosciences, Valdosta State University **It From Bit: Power of Two**

Patricia Marks, Ph.D.

Professor Emerita of English, Valdosta State University**Bicycles, Bangs, and Bloomers: The New Woman in the Popular Press**

**In her talk, Patricia Marks** explored how 19th-century feminist movements were portrayed by male caricaturists and editors in satirical magazines like *Puck* and *Punch*. These caricatures depicted the “New Woman” challenging societal norms by advocating for education, independence, and participation in traditionally male-dominated fields. Despite initially aiming to undermine women’s equality efforts, the portrayals shifted toward a more lighthearted view, reflecting changing attitudes toward gender roles.**In his talk, Dennis Marks** discussed how matrix representations of geometric algebras over real numbers correlate with various numerical systems based on space-time metrics. It will highlight how quantum information can be accurately depicted in space-times without time dimensions, while those with multiple time dimensions lack coherence. Recursive generation over **Z**2 has implications for combatting cancerous growths and for conflict resolution using “Marks’s Matrix Method,” impacting political, philosophical, and theological spheres.
