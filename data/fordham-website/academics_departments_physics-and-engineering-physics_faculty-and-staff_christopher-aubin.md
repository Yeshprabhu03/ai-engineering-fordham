Before joining the faculty at Fordham in 2010, Prof. Aubin was a research scientist at Columbia University and the College of William and Mary. During this time he has developed a research program in high energy theory, calculating quantities in Quantum Chromodynamics that are useful in testing the current Standard Model of Particle Physics with respect to experimental results. Such calculations may point the way for learning new physics.
