Professor Haider's interests encompass intermediate energy nuclear physics, with emphasis on formation of η-mesic nucleus, pion double-charge-exchange reactions and role of ρ-meson in nuclear physics. He predicted the existence of η-mesic nucleus which has been experimentally detected in 2008 by an international collaboration of experimental nuclear physicists in Juelich, Germany. Another area of his research is nuclear reactions, particularly fusion between two light nuclei at energies of astrophysical interest. He also studies the structure of elementary particles from the point of view of quark-gluon confinement inside a "Bag". He has authored numerous papers, some of which includes Fordham students as co-authors.
