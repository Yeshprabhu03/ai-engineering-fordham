# Graduate School Opportunities for Physics Majors

There are many resources for you when searching for a graduate program. While it is not an exhaustive list, you can go to [Grad School Shopper](http://gradschoolshopper.com/) to search through many possibilities. You can also check out various possibilities in the [US News rankings](http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/physics-rankings). Additionally, of course, come talk to any of us in the department about universities that we know about!
