Prof. McDermott has published research on multiple topics within political behavior, including personalities in politics, voting cues, information shortcuts in elections, public opinion of Congress, and vote choice in congressional elections. She is the author of two books, and her work has been

[published](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0UmsWdAAAAAJ&hl=en)in some of the profession's topjournals, including the*American Journal of Political Science*, the*Journal of Politics*,*Political Research Quarterly*, and*Public Opinion Quarterly*.Prof. McDermott's current research focuses on the way that masculine and feminine personality traits affect Americans' political behavior and attitudes. Her recent book

(Oxford University Press 2016) analyzes how these personality profiles affect party affiliation, vote choice, ideology, political participation, and views of sex roles in society and politics. For example, her analysis demonstrates that individuals with high levels of feminine traits are drawn to the Democratic Party while more masculine individuals prefer the GOP.*Masculinity, Femininity, and American Political Behavior*Prof. McDermott is also a survey research practitioner, having conducted election surveys at The Los Angeles Times Poll and the CBS News Election and Survey Unit.
