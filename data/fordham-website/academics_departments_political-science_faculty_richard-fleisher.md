I am a Professor in the Political Science Department at Fordham University. My teaching and research focuses on the study of Political Institutions and Processes, with specific interest in the U.S. Congress, the Presidency, and political parties and elections. I have published widely including, The President in the Legislative Arena (University of Chicago Press), Polarized Politics (CQ Press) and American Political Parties: Decline or Resurgence (CQ Press). My list of publications also include articles that appeared in The American Political Science Review, American Journal of Political Science, Journal of Politics, Political Research Quarterly, Polity, Political Science Quarterly, American Politics Quarterly, Presidential Studies Quarterly and Legislative Studies Quarterly.

Currently my research focuses on the analysis of congressional roll calls, the causes and consequences of partisan polarization, and the impact of environmentalism on voting in presidential and congressional elections.
