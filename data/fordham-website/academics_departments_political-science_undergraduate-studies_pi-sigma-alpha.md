# Pi Sigma Alpha

Fordham is the proud host of the Delta Zeta chapter of Pi Sigma Alpha, the national political science honor society. Nationally, Pi Sigma Alpha involves more than 8,000 students and 650 chapters at universities and colleges across the U.S.

Each year, our faculty members select high-achieving juniors and seniors for induction into this honor society, and we sponsor annual programming featuring guest speakers and panels on issues related to all aspects of politics.

### Chapter Activity Grants

The National Office sponsors an annual program of grants to chapters for special activities. Proposals are accepted through October 31 of each year, the awards committee meets in November, and grants are awarded immediately thereafter. The current budget for this program is $95,000. The maximum grant award for a chapter is $2,000.
