# Immigration Attorneys' Perspectives on Psychological Evaluations

[Prof. Andrew Rasmussen](/academics/departments/psychology/faculty-and-staff/andrew-rasmussen/) and a colleague at City College of New York, CUNY, [Prof. Adeyinka Akinsulure-Smith](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/profiles/adeyinka-akinsulure-smith?srsltid=AfmBOootIjWtMQoe9WEuDO6oaojcPGl6Fam5SUs2TOV4ViCFX3LOJugf), are conducting a research study to better understand advocates’ experiences and perspectives regarding psychological evaluations in immigration cases.

### Why This Matters:

Psychological evaluations often play a critical role in immigration proceedings, especially in asylum, hardship waivers, U visa, T visa, and cancellation of removal cases. However, little is known about how attorneys assess their usefulness, quality, and ethical implications.

**We invite all attorneys or DOJ/EOIR accredited advocates who have ever worked on immigration proceedings** to participate in a brief, confidential survey (~15-20 minutes) exploring:

- How psychological evaluations are used in practice
- How attorneys and psychologists communicate regarding evaluations
- Preferences regarding content and structure of evaluations
- Impacts of working in immigration law

This study seeks to establish professional guidelines for these evaluations and improve collaboration between legal and mental health professionals in the immigration process.

- 100 $100 electronic gift certificates

Participation is voluntary, anonymous, and IRB-approved.
