Her research interests center on the field of cultural-clinical psychology, with an emphasis on the interconnections between culture, sociopolitical factors, and narratives surrounding mental health. Currently, she is interested in understanding the experiences of neurodivergent immigrants in the US through an intersectional, postcolonial, neurodiversity-affirming lens. Prior to Fordham, Rebeca completed her M.A. at Concordia University (Montreal, Canada), where she explored experiences of discrimination and the psychological distress experienced by university students with self-reported neurodivergencies.

**Laís Granemann** joined the Clinical Psychology Doctoral Program in 2020. Originally from Brazil, she obtained her master's degree in Social-Organizational Psychology from the University of Brasilia, where she studied the acculturation of Brazilian mothers and fathers raising their children in foreign countries. As a recipient of the Emerging Leaders in the Americas Program scholarship, she worked at the University of Windsor, Canada on a research project on post-migration factors associated with mental and physical health in Syrian refugees. Her career goals include combining research and clinical work to promote culturally sensitive health interventions to refugees, immigrants, and other ethnic minority individuals.

**Michelle Leon** joined the Clinical Psychology Doctoral Program in 2018. She is interested in investigating the ethnic and cultural factors that affect immigrants’, refugees’, and other underserved minority groups’ wellbeing. Furthermore, she is interested in investigating cultural concepts of psychological distress, specifically, trauma.

Prior to Fordham, she worked at NYU’s Department of Population Health on an RCT investigation of a technology-based medication adherence intervention for low-income individuals in New York City. Her career goals include promoting cultural competence in psychological assessment and intervention through research and hopes to work with vulnerable, underserved, and marginalized trauma-affected families.

She is interested in social and cultural factors that affect mental health and wellbeing among immigrant and ethnic minority populations, especially at-risk youths and their families. Her master's thesis research project is a qualitative study of parent-child acculturation dissonance among West African immigrant families.
