Funded by the Greenwall Foundation

There have been a number of highly influential public health ethics theoretical frameworks, a recently revised American Public Health Association (APHA) Public Health Ethics Code, and ethical guidance for public health emergencies developed for the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. All provide broad guidance for ethical decision-making regarding access to medical care during the COVID pandemic, but due to the novelty of the current pandemic and the crises in Opioid Agonist Treatment it has created, little is known regarding it’s applicability to the challenges facing patients and clinicians providing addiction care in economically marginalized regions of the U.S. This study will provide a critical analysis of the extent to which the core values articulated in current models for public health ethics reflect the moral values of PWID and ethical decision-making challenges faced by OAT staff in Puerto Rico. Drawing on the perspectives of key stakeholders this project will also contribute to the development of tailored, contextually-based ethics guidelines for OAT and other forms of addiction treatment for current and future infectious disease crises.

The broad aim of this 3-phase study is to examine associations between the pre- and post-2024 US presidential sociopolitical climate and mental health and substance use and sexual health behaviors among Black, Latine and non-Hispanic White LGBT adults. To achieve this aim: (1) we will examine across 3 time points (pre-election October; post-election late November; and post-inauguration February) individual (LGBT identity, education, income, financial security, generational status) and social determinants (LGBT stigma and discrimination, specific policy concerns, perceived LGBT sociopolitical climate, civic engagement) associated with stability and change mental health and substance use and sexual risk behaviors; (2) the intersectional experience of LGBT of different race/ethnicity backgrounds will be further explored through measures of racial/ethnic identity, perceived racial/ethnic sociopolitical climate, and racial/ethnic discrimination outside and within the LGBT community; and (3) the study will also examine the relationship between the use of alcohol, cannabis, and other drugs on sexual health behaviors and how these substances may be used to coping with sociopolitical and general distress.

**Online Antisocial and Anti-racist Risk-taking Profiles among AAPI College Students: Cultural Correlates, College Adjustment and Substance Use**Celia B. Fisher, PhD, Fordham University

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) students have been and continue to be exposed to heightened levels of online racism. In response, AAPI young adults have engaged in online anti-racism actions through coping behaviors, posting about racial pride, and addressing race-related community issues. These behaviors have recently been classified as positive (constructive and socially acceptable) risk behaviors, which have implications for college functioning. In addition to these behaviors, the college period is marked by increased risk-taking, including online antisocial and addictive behaviors that are associated with educational adjustment, mental health, and offline health behaviors. Despite being among the most internet-connected, AAPI college students have remained a hidden population in risk-taking research. This invisibility is partly due to the model minority myth, which portrays AAPI individuals as overachievers who do not face personal or academic challenges. The current study aimed to identify online risk-taking profiles among AAPI college students, explore how cultural factors are related to profile membership, and examine whether these profiles differ in educational, relational, and psychological functioning, as well as offline health risks. In March 2024, 268 AAPI college students completed an online survey assessing online risk behaviors, cultural factors, and sociodemographic characteristics. Three profiles emerged: Low Risk, Anti-racist Risk, and Antisocial Risk. The Anti-racist Risk group exhibited higher ethnic centrality and exploration, collectivism, internalization of the model minority achievement myth, and academic adjustment, along with lower substance use. In contrast, the Antisocial Risk group showed higher endorsement of the model minority unrestricted mobility myth, higher socioeconomic status (SES), higher substance use, and lower academic adjustment. This study underscores the importance of recognizing differences in the co-occurring patterns of negative and positive risk-taking among AAPI college students in the online environment. It highlights the need for culturally sensitive research and interventions that address the heterogeneity of AAPI emerging adults, considering the cultural values and racial experiences that influence how the internet impacts their lives, and the links between online risk-taking, academic adjustment, and substance use.

College is a period characterized by experimentation, exploration, self-focus, and relational changes, often leading to increased risk-taking. There are public health concerns regarding college risk-taking behaviors and their implications for academic adjustment and health-compromising outcomes. However, less is known about these associations among Black and Latinx college students, who may face heightened challenges, particularly when enrolled in predominantly White institutions. This study examined the online positive and negative risk-taking profiles among Black and Latinx college students, and how these behavioral profiles relate to college adjustment, offline health risks, online discrimination, and sociodemographic factors. In March 2024, 571 Black and Latinx college students completed online questionnaires assessing their use of social media for anti-racism actions, coping with racism, antisocial risks, problematic internet use, exposure to online discrimination, college adjustment, and substance use and sexual risk behaviors. Latent profile analysis revealed four distinct profiles: High Online Risk, Moderate Online Risk, Anti-racism Risk, and Low Risk. The High Online Risk and Moderate Online Risk groups engaged in the highest levels of both positive and negative online risk-taking, experienced greater exposure to online racial discrimination, and reported higher levels of binge drinking, yet maintained high to moderate levels of educational adjustment. The Anti-racism Risk group exhibited moderate levels of positive and low levels of negative risk-taking, along with better college functioning and lower rates of binge drinking and marijuana use compared to other profiles. The Low Online Risk group did not engage in online risk behaviors, reported the lowest offline health risks, and had higher scores on psychological adjustment compared to the High and Moderate Online Risk groups

**Sexual identity development moderates the risk of sexting under the influence of substance use among adolescent sexual minority men**Celia B. Fisher, PhD, Fordham University

The primary aim of this study is to examine the extent to which adolescent sexual minority men (ASMM) are motivated to engage in sexting by psychological, social, and partner-related factors. Additionally, this study seeks to determine which of these motivations and influences are associated with healthy sexual development, and which may signal interpersonal, sexual, or mental health risks. This research will explore both the positive and negative impacts of past sexting experiences on ASMM. Sexting is defined as the sending of sexually suggestive or explicit images, videos, and text messages via digital devices such as computers and smartphones. Despite its relevance, there has been a significant lack of research focusing on the risk and protective factors associated with negative sexting outcomes among ASMM. An analysis of data from a U.S. online survey of 332 ASMM (ages 16-18), who are diverse in terms of race/ethnicity and have sexted male recipients at least three times in the past two months, revealed that sexting while under the influence of substances was linked to greater negative and fewer positive sexting outcomes. Furthermore, strong sexual identity commitment was found to mitigate the association between non-cannabis drug use and negative outcomes, whereas sexual identity uncertainty amplified this association. These findings have important implications for parents, sex education policies, health practitioners, and LGBTQ+ youth support services.

**Influence of LGBT Adolescent Identity Processes on the Association Between Offline and Social Media Discrimination and Mental Health and Substance Use**Celia B. Fisher, PhD, Fordham University

Xiangyu Tao, MA, Fordham University (HDSJ Lab Doctoral Student)

**Purpose**. Anti-transgender and anti-gay legislation have increased social acceptability of discriminatory actions against LGBTQ+ populations exposing youth to heterosexist and transphobic social media messaging. Drawing on the minority stress and identity development models, this study examined the influence of LGBT identity exploration and commitment on the association between exposure to these forms of discrimination and mental health and SUD.

**Methods**. An online survey was completed by 471 racially/ethnically diverse LGBT 14-18 year-olds. Multiple regression assessed the moderating influences of identity processes on the association between online and social media discrimination and depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and SUD (CRAFFT). Demographic variables and offline and online identity disclosure and social support served as covariates.

**Results**. Overall, 63.5% of youth met criteria for moderate levels of depression, 52.7% for anxiety and 39.8% were at risk for SUD. Identity commitment and exploration were associated with increases in social media and offline discrimination. Although commitment was negatively related to depression and anxiety, it did not buffer the detrimental impact of discrimination on these symptoms. Rather, paradoxically at higher levels of offline discrimination, it increased the association for depression and anxiety. Identity exploration was associated with increased SUD, but did not moderate the association between discrimination and SUD.

**Discussion**. This is the first study to examine relationships among LGBT adolescent identity processes, offline and social media discrimination, and mental health and substance use. By investigating these relationships, the study furthers understanding of developmental processes that influence risk and resilience among LGBT youth in response to discrimination.

**"COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Among Economically Marginalized Hispanic Parents of Children Under Five Years in the United States"**

Hispanic children have high rates of COVID-19 related hospitalizations and related deaths. Following FDA emergency approval of COVID-19 vaccination for children under five, vaccination rates have been alarmingly low, especially in border states with significant Hispanic populations. The aim of the current study was to identify demographic, health belief, structural and cultural factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among economically marginalized Hispanic parents of children under five living in US border states. In July, 2022, 309 Hispanic female guardians in Texas, Arizona and New Mexico responded to an online survey assessing parental intent to vaccinate their child, demographic parent and child characteristics, COVID-19 health and vaccine beliefs, trust in traditional sources of health information, physician and community support, and acculturation to Anglo American norms. Data indicated 45.6% of parents did not intend to vaccinate their child (resistant parents), 22.0% were unsure, and 32.4% intended to vaccinate their child (accepting parents). Bivariate correlations followed by multinomial logistic regression indicated vaccine acceptance was positively associated with perceived child COVID-19 susceptibility, trust in traditional health resources, a doctor’s recommendation for vaccination, community support, child’s age, higher parental income and education, and if the child had private compared to government or no health insurance. Vaccine acceptance was negatively associated with vaccine misconceptions, belief vaccination was unnecessary, general vaccine mistrust, nativity, time living in the US, and preference for English language. This study demonstrates how misinformation and distrust regarding vaccine safety, lack of community and other structural supports, and acculturation to perceived Anglo American norms are risk factors for vaccine hesitancy among economically marginalized Hispanic families. The research highlights the importance of public health strategies that draw on Hispanic community partnerships and on early and enhanced pediatrician-parent communication about routine and COVID-specific vaccinations are important public health strategies.

**Social Media: A Double-Edged Sword for LGBT Youth**Celia B. Fisher, PhD, Fordham University

As LGBT youth navigate a heteronormative and cisnormative society where they face the pressures of minority stress, social networking sites (SNS) play an increasingly critical role in their journey towards connection and acceptance. Through SNS platforms, youth can find a sense of community, but are also exposed to heterosexist and transphobic SNS messaging. These experiences can have a positive or negative impact on mental health. The current study examined how LGBT youth’s online experience as reflected in their qualitative narratives can illuminate relationships between quantitative measures of exposure to social media discrimination, social support, mental health, and substance use. An online survey completed by 398 racially/ethnically diverse LGBT youth (14 – 18 years) administered quantitative measures of exposure to SNS discrimination, social support, loneliness, mental health, and substance use and an open-ended question on youth’s experiences and feelings related to social belonging or isolation on SNS. Between 40% - 63% of youth met criteria for moderate levels of depression, anxiety and substance use disorder and these were associated with moderate to high levels of SNS discrimination. SNS social support and loneliness positively correlated with social media discrimination, but not with mental health indices. Content analysis of narratives yielded 3 over-arching themes of SNS characterized as (1) a supportive environment, where youth felt a sense of belonging, made friends, and cultivated a positive identity; (2) a hostile environment where they experienced personal attacks, observed attacks against other LGBT persons, felt isolated and remained closeted, and (3) a both supportive and hostile environment where they experienced support and hostility and where LGBT SNS communities served as a refuge against discrimination. For all youth SNS discrimination was associated with mental health and SUD symptoms. However, compared to youth who characterized social media as hostile, at the highest levels of discrimination those experiencing SNS as supportive or both supportive and hostile, were at greater mental health risk and SUD. One reason may be that those holding positive or mixed expectations for their online experience, are not prepared for exposure to the more extreme levels of hostility they may encounter. This study also underscores the value of mixed-method approaches in understanding the benefits and risks of social media for LGBT youth.

Sexting is defined as the sending/receiving of sexual messages, photos, or videos via online communication (including via text message, email, social media platform, or dating/hook-up app). Research indicates that LGBTQ youth, and specifically AMSM, sext more frequently than their heterosexual peers. However, there is a dearth of research that provides a comprehensive descriptive analysis of sexting motivations and consequences specific to the AMSM population. Additionally, there has been no research to date that examines the associations between reported motivations and actual consequences of sexting. This online quantitative project will survey 400 AMSM (14-17 years) who have prior sexting experience from diverse backgrounds to examine the associations between their reported motivations for setting and the consequences they experienced as a direct result of sexting.

**Risks and Benefits of Online Social Media Advocacy Work for LGBT Youth**

Research indicates that LGBTQ youth are more likely to experience cyberbullying than their peers, especially among those who engaged in advocacy work against anti-LGBTQ attitudes. Qualitative work also shows that social media networks can serve as an important support resource for them. It is unclear whether the negative mental health impact of sexual and gender social media discrimination can be buffered by such supportive networks for LGBTQ youth living in different social-political environments. This online mix-method project will survey 450 LGTBQ youth from diverse backgrounds to examine the associations among their online advocacy work for promoting LGBTQ equality, exposure to social media sexual/gender discrimination, perceived and seeking of social support on social media, and mental health and substance use.
