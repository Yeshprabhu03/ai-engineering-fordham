Welcome to Pediatric Psychology & Health Behaviors!

Our team is composed of graduate students, undergraduates, collaborators and alumni of whom we refuse to let go. We mainly study within the areas of pediatric psychology and health behaviors but are also open to and excited by related topics. Our research program focuses on behavioral medicine among diverse patients across the lifespan. The overarching goal of this work is to improve health behaviors and quality of life by developing patient-friendly, culturally-sensitive interventions with strong translational capabilities.


We have a long-standing relationship with the Department of Pediatrics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (MSSM). This research program is led by
[Dr. Rachel Annunziato](/academics/departments/psychology/faculty-and-staff/rachel-annunziato/). In addition to our work, Rachel is also the mother of beautiful, sassy twin boys, Brendan and Daniel, and an avid sports fan (especially of her beloved UConn Huskies).
