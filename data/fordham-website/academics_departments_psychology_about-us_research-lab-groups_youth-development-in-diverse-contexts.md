Fordham's lab of Youth Development in Diverse Contexts (YDDC) examines the influence of various daily life experiences on developmental outcomes for youth and adolescents. We aim to understand the role of identity development, stress, and diverse contextual factors in determining psychosocial and academic trajectories for minority youth. YDDC research takes an ecosystemic approach, examining not only the role of racial experiences, but of many other factors on wellbeing, allowing for the development of a more holistic picture of youth functioning.
