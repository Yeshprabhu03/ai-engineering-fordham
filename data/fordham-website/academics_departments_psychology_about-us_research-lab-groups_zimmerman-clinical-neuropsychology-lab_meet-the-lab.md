## Director

![Molly Zimmerman.](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/psychology/Molly-Zimmerman.jpg)

**Molly Zimmerman, PhD**

Dr. Zimmerman is a licensed clinical neuropsychologist who enjoys engaging in a wide-range of research, teaching, and clinical practice activities. Her research interests explore the many ways in which cognitive abilities interact with medical conditions such as insomnia, sleep apnea, dementia, and sports-related traumatic brain injury. Much of her early clinical work involved diagnosis of dementia syndromes and she has maintained that interest in her research investigations that seek early predictors of age-associated cognitive decline. She also has a longstanding interest in sleep disorders and the complex relationships between sleep, cognition, and mood. An emerging interest has been the impact of light exposure, particularly blue light, on sleep and cognitive abilities in younger adults. And finally, she has focused on the impact of so-called subconcussive events sustained during normal sports play, such as heading of the ball in soccer, on measures of cognitive function and brain structure and function.

### Graduate Students


![Profile picture of CPDP graduate student Theresa Lin](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/psychology/Theresa_Lin.jpg)

**Theresa Lin, MA**

Theresa is a graduate student in the Clinical Psychology Doctoral Program at Fordham University. She received her BA in Neuroscience from the University of Pennsylvania in 2019 and her MA in Psychology from Fordham University in 2023. Prior to Fordham, she worked at Mount Sinai Beth Israel as a clinical research coordinator studying the genetics behind Parkinson's disease as well as other movement disorders. Theresa is interested in cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases among older adults and preventative measures that may be developed to remediate that effect. She is also interested in the cognitive effects of sleep disordered breathing among young adults.

![Caitlin Dougher.](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/psychology/Caitlin-Dougher.jpeg)

**Caitlin Dougher, MS**Caitlin is a graduate student in the Clinical Psychology Doctoral Program at Fordham University. She received her BS in Psychology with a minor in Biology from Villanova University, followed by her MS in Psychology from Drexel University. Right before starting at Fordham, Caitlin worked as a Psychometrist at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. She was directly involved in intake interviews and neuropsychological assessment of individuals over 18 years old with varying disorders and diseases. More notably, this involved working with pre and post-surgical Epilepsy, TBI, Parkinson's, and dementia patients. Caitlin is interested in sleep behaviors and quality in TBI, specifically sports concussion. Additionally, she hopes to study rehabilitation outcomes and treatment interventions for the same population.

![Profile picture of CPDP graduate student Kayri Fernandez](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/psychology/KayriFernandez.png)

**Kayri Bartolotta, MS**

Kayri is a graduate student in the Clinical Psychology Doctoral Program at Fordham University. She holds a Master of Science in Neuroscience and Education from Columbia University and received her Bachelor of Arts degree in Neuroscience and Anthropology from Wheaton College, MA. Kayri is an accomplished clinical research professional, and psychometrist with extensive experience in clinical trial management, study coordination, regulatory compliance and psychometric testing. Kayri received her post-baccalaureate training in psychometric testing from Harvard’s training hospital Brigham & Women’s in Boston. She has been involved in clinical projects within Columbia University, Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital and Mount Sinai Beth Israel. Kayri has also contributed to multiple scientific publications, including studies focused on Alzheimer's disease and cognitive aging. Kayri will be completing the Neuropsychology Major Area of Study at Fordham University and is looking forward to broadening her knowledge in healthy cognitive aging and in creating early preventive measures for Dementia and related disorders. In her free time, she enjoys playing tennis with her husband John and spending time with their cat, Mr. Rocky.


![Profile picture of CPDP graduate student Hasib Mia](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/psychology/HasibMia.png)

**Hasib Mia, BS**

Hasib is a graduate student in the Clinical Psychology Doctoral Program at Fordham University where he also received his BS in 2023. Prior to graduate school, he worked at Columbia University Irving Medical Center as a clinical research coordinator studying longevity, the genetics behind Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Early-Onset AD and neuropsychiatric symptom (NPS) in AD. Hasib is particularly interested in the effects of sleep across the lifespan with a focus on its impact on cognitive decline and NPS. He is also interested in how specific sleep disorders such as sleep fragmentation or irregular circadian rhythms may accelerate cognitive decline with the goal of early intervention strategies to mitigate the cognitive toll of these disruptions.


### Undergraduate Students

![Profile picture of student Stella Haralambou](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/psychology/Stella-Haralambou500.jpg)

**Stella Haralambou**

Stella is a junior at Fordham Rose Hill, majoring in Psychology on the Pre-Health track. Stella has interned as a research assistant at Northwell Health with the Neurology Department, focusing on neurological disorders such as Epilepsy, Myasthenia Gravis, and Strokes. She also worked with the Pulmonary Department, focusing on sleep quality in patients with Cystic Fibrosis. Stella is interested in neurodegenerative diseases and their effects on behavior and cognition. Upon graduation, Stella hopes to pursue her PhD in clinical psychology with the goal of becoming a neuropsychologist.

![Profile picture of student Lucy Kochman-Sabbatino](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/psychology/Lucy-Kochman-Sabbatino500.jpg)

**Lucy Kochman-Sabbatino**

Lucy is currently an undergraduate sophomore at Fordham Rose Hill majoring in psychology. She plans to earn her Masters in applied psychological methods through Fordham’s accelerated master’s program. She is interested in research and neuropsychology and aims to get her PhD in the future. Lucy’s interest in psychology stems from her high school studies where she was most interested in cognitive behaviors and psychological disorders.


![Profile picture of student Rebecca Lothson](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/psychology/RebeccaLothson.png)

**Rebecca Lothson**

Rebecca is currently a senior at Fordham University, majoring in Psychology and English. Rebecca is interested in studying sleep patterns and their impacts on cognition, memory, and well-being in adolescents and college students. More broadly, she is interested in working with children and adolescents, learning more about this population and how to best serve their psychological needs. After graduation, Rebecca plans to attend graduate school and get her Masters of Social Work so she can work as a licensed mental health counselor.
