# DEI Advisory Council

### What do we do?

The Psychology Department’s standing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Advisory Council is charged to guide a transparent process of inquiry into Department policies and practices. We aim to identify and make recommendations for specific action steps regarding barriers and facilitators that impact recruitment, retention, and advancement of the Department’s faculty, students, and staff of diverse backgrounds, as well as department-level policies and trends that may negatively impact an inclusive culture. As part of this work, we review curriculum offerings and make recommendations to infuse DEI principles into classroom and research settings, as well as other departmental spaces (e.g., meetings, colloquia). We also develop and share DEI resources across the Department. The DEI Council seeks to act as a change agent by challenging the status quo and championing DEI principles and practices as we recommend policies and practices to be reviewed and adopted by the Department.

### How do we work?

The DEI Council connects dedicated volunteers from across the department. We meet monthly as an organizing committee to oversee ongoing and future DEI initiatives across the department. Our ongoing efforts take place in working groups that meet regularly to make progress on specific initiatives consistent with the department’s ongoing needs.

### Who are we?

The DEI Council consists of departmental faculty, staff, alumni, and undergraduate and graduate students volunteers. *Any member of the department is welcome to join the council, as long as they are able to consistently contribute to the ongoing work of a standing committee and/or task force.*
