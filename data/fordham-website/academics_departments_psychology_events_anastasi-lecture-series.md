Established in 2008 as part of the activities of the Anastasi Professor for Psychometrics and Quantitative Psychology, the Anastasi Lectures are delivered by leading experts in psychology, educational measurement, industrial and organizational psychology, and quantitative methods.

The Lectures honor [Dr. Anastasi’s distinguished career](http://www.apa.org/about/governance/president/anastasi.aspx). They showcase recent developments in the areas of measurement, assessment, testing, and quantitative psychology, and highlight their translation into policy and practice. The Lectures provide a unique opportunity to share with the public emerging research directions in psychometrics and measurement, and the critical implications of these developments to various testing (K-12 testing, college, and graduate admissions, personnel and employment) applications and other key policy arenas.

The Lectures take place in the Fall semester on the Lincoln Center Campus of Fordham University, and are open to faculty, students, and the general public.
