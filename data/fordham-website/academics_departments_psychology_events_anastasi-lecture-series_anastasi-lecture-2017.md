The Likert rating scale dates back to a 1932 paper by Rensis Likert; it has been a mainstay of psychology for many decades. However, problems with Likert scaling abound. Individual differences in response biases, cultural differences in rating scale styles, and measurement model misspecification all have the potential to invalidate results.

Forced choice methods, where the rater simply chooses which of two or more statements is "more like me," offer hope for addressing these problems. Drasgow will discuss these methods and suggest that to solve the ipsativity problem of traditional scoring of forced choice instruments, an item response theory model, such as the Multi-Unidimensional Pairwise Preference Model, should be used. He will also describe some findings from military samples.
