In 2010-2012, a few largely coincidental events led experimental psychologists to realize that their approach to collecting, analyzing, and reporting data made it too easy to publish false-positive findings. This sparked a period of methodological reflection that we have called “psychology’s renaissance.” The talk reviews the problems that gave rise to the methodological reflection, focusing on the events and what made the issue 'go viral', and reviews the ways in which psychology is changing to become a more credible science.
