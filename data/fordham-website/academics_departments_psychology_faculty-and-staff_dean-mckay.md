My research is actively carried out through the operations of my research lab,

[Compulsive, Obsessive, and Anxiety Program (C.O.A.P.)](/academics/departments/psychology/about-us/research-lab-groups/coap/). There are a multitude of ongoing research projects I am actively engaged in with graduate students to investigate my research interests outlined in detail below.**Anxiety and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders**Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent in the general population, as is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD is a complex and heterogeneous psychiatric condition that affects children, adolescents, and adults. It has been associated with a wide range of psychiatric disability and is generally considered difficult to treat, yet responsive to available empirically supported interventions. In generally, I have been interested in the nature and treatment of anxiety and OCD, including maintaining factors, subtypes, complicating factors such as posttraumatic stress, assessment of severity, and general and specific cognitive factors. This has led to consideration of basic reconceptualization of the condition. Presently, there are several models for OCD, but none adequately accounts for the full diversity of the disorder.

I have been actively investigating the role of disgust in phobias and contamination fear. Contamination fear is a problem that naturally fits with disgust. Disgust is a ‘communicable’ emotion, in that otherwise neutral objects have the capacity for taking on disgust properties. A common problem among individuals with contamination fear is the notion of objects becoming ‘contaminated’ following incidental contact with items believed to be contaminated as well. Disgust also plays a prominent role in other anxiety disorders and states. Most notably, research has supported a role for disgust in blood-injury-injection phobia, and in insect and small animal phobias. However, as illustrated in a recent edited text (Olatunji & McKay, 2009), disgust has been associated with a wide range of other psychiatric conditions.

In the past several years, these political movements have led to increasing numbers of practitioners to engage in political activism in patient-facing settings. While the intention of these political gestures may be ground in the practitioner’s particular political ideology, and thus assumed by them to be in the interest of the general public, it can also be alienating to patients and lead to poorer outcomes, patient frustration, and treatment dropout. Among practitioners, these political movements among colleagues can lead to unwillingness to speak up when policies may have identifiable harms to minoritized groups. The aim of this line of research is to quantify how politicization affects patient care in mental and medical healthcare, as well as to assess the impact on collegiality and openness of discourse among practitioners. This line of research is multidisciplinary, including with experts in bioethics, political science, Judaica studies, and cognitive science.

However, there are also a large number of mass-marketed questionable intervention packages that are not based on sound theory, and lack a clear scientific basis. We have been examining clinical and systemic factors that lead to the attractiveness and adoption of these questionable therapeutic methods.
