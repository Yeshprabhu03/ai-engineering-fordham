# Courses and Degree Requirements for M.S. in Applied Psychological Methods

## Master of Science in Applied Psychological Methods (MAPM)

The Applied Psychological Methods Master’s Program currently requires **30 semester hours** for the MS degree. The department trains students to apply psychological research and statistical methods in work settings ranging from profit and non-profit business to education, health, government, media, community organizations, and research institutes. Students learn core quantitative concepts, theories, methods, and related considerations, including psychometric theory, statistical methods such as regression and multivariate analyses, survey research methods, and ethical issues related to research in applied settings.

After no more than one semester, students specialize in one of two concentrations:

[Program Evaluation](#ProgEval), focusing on the evaluation of programs and program delivery, social policy, organizational change, and specific content areas such as education, development, or cognition.[Tests and Measurement](#TestMeas), focusing on item response theory, structural equation modeling, and hierarchical linear modeling.

Students will complete a total of four core courses (12 credits), and five specialization courses (15 credits), and a one-semester internship (3 credits). Full time students are expected to take three or four 3-credit courses a semester, part-time students one or two. Internships may be arranged following one semester of completed work. Any substitutions must be reviewed and approved by the Director of the MS Program. Additional course work completed over the summer or transferred from a prior institution may reduce the number of courses per semester.

Some interdisciplinary collaboration between Political Science, Computer and Information Science and Graduate School of Education faculty and students will be accomplished through this program.
