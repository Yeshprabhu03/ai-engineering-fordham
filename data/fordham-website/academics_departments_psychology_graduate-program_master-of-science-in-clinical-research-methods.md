# Master of Science in Clinical Research Methods

The competition for a spot in a top doctoral program or a research job in clinical psychology is fierce. That’s why Fordham has developed a unique M.S. degree program in clinical research methods to give you a competitive edge.

Whether your goal is to earn a Ph.D. or to pursue a non-doctoral research position, our two-year program will provide you with intensive research experience and a deep understanding of the core elements of graduate-level psychology.

This is a highly selective program that accepts only a handful of strong applicants every year. However, an extensive background in psychology or prior research experience is not a prerequisite.

*Note: Students who enroll in the Clinical Research Methods program will not be considered for admission to the Clinical PhD program. The goal of this program is to help you gain admission to other top tier Clinical PhD programs - it is not a way to increase your chances of admission to Fordham's Clinical PhD. *
