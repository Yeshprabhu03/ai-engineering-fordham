Nine core and affiliate faculty members mentor ADP doctoral students, bringing diverse expertise across developmental science to support each student’s unique interests and goals. Our mentorship-based program asks applicants to identify a primary and secondary mentor when applying; while most students work with one mentor throughout the program, we also support co-mentoring or changes in mentorship as students’ needs and interests evolve, with guidance from the ADP director.
