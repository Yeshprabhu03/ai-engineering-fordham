# Courses and Degree Requirements for Ph.D. in Applied Developmental Psychology


![Psychology - Applied Developmental Program](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/ADP_Group_5_email.jpg)

The curriculum of the ADP program focuses on human development (bio-psycho-social) in contexts and over time; prevention/intervention and health promotion; theories and methods of developmental assessment; program evaluation; and social policy. Coursework emphasizes the importance of applying research, as three courses require field placements (intervention/prevention, program evaluation, and the practicum). These ADP program field experiences serve to foster relationships with the communities of the Bronx, the NYC metropolitan area, and beyond. Because human development occurs in contexts, all courses and field experiences include a deep understanding and discussions of inter-individual differences in intra-individual change, multiculturalism, vulnerable populations, as well as ethical and moral issues in all three areas of research, applications, and policy.
