# Clinical Major Area of Study: Child and Adolescent

The Child and Adolescent major area of study (formerly Child and Family) is designed to provide students with a grounding in theory, research, and practice concerning the psychological and behavioral problems of children, adolescents, and families. Attention is given to the main areas of psychopathology, assessment, and intervention, with consideration of developmental, systems-related, and cultural issues.

The goal of the Child and Adolescent major area of study is to provide students with a solid foundation in matters of child and adolescent psychology to build upon throughout their training experiences.

Requirements of the major area of study include completion of the clinical psychology core curriculum, along with a minimum of three courses within the child and adolescent psychology major area of study, at least two externships in a child or adolescent therapy setting, and predoctoral or doctoral research in a topic related to child and adolescent psychology.

The primary goal of the Child and Adolescent major area of study is to develop knowledgeable and highly skilled clinical psychologists. The Child and Adolescent major area of study enables students to focus their elective coursework, externship placements, and research projects in order to develop a higher level of competency in evidence-based interventions for children and adolescents. Our students have the opportunity to work and train with child psychologists throughout NYC in a variety of settings. Ultimately, we see our students developing careers in academia, research, and clinical settings, and encourage our alumni to pursue board certification in [Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology](https://abpp.org/application-information/learn-about-specialty-boards/clinical-child-adolescent/).
