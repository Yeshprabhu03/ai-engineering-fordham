# Clinical Major Area of Study: Health

The *Health Psychology* major area of study at Fordham is part of an APA accredited program designed to provide an opportunity for clinical students interested in integrating principles of behavioral medicine into their clinical work and research. This is achieved through a systematic series of coursework, research and clinical experience in a variety of settings.

The Health Psychology major area of study at Fordham is in line with the mission statements of APA [Division 38 (Health Psychology)](https://societyforhealthpsychology.org/) and [Division 54 (Pediatric Psychology)](https://pedpsych.org/), which seek to improve the lives of individuals, families, and society by promoting health and psychological well-being, preventing illness, and improving health care through research, practice, education, training, and advocacy.

Requirements of the major area of study include completion of the clinical psychology core curriculum along with completion of a minimum of three courses within the *Health Psychology* major area of study, at least two externships in health psychology and predoctoral or doctoral research in a topic related to health psychology.

The primary goal of this program is to train students on how to integrate biomedical information about health and illness with clinical training to improve outcomes in health psychology research, clinical work, assessment and intervention. Our students have the opportunity to work and train with health psychologists throughout a variety of hospitals and healthcare settings throughout NYC. Ultimately, we see our students going on to thriving health psychology careers in academia, research, medical and clinical settings and encourage our alumni to pursue board certification in clinical health psychology.
