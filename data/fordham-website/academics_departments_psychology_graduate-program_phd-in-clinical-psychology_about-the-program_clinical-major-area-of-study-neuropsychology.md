# Clinical Major Area of Study: Neuropsychology

The *Clinical Neuropsychology* major area of study at Fordham is part of an APA accredited program designed to provide an opportunity for clinical students to develop a more intensive academic focus and clinical experience in neuropsychology without sacrificing the integrity of general clinical training. The clinical neuropsychology major area of study emphasizes the significant influence of brain-behavior relationships in both research and clinical work. This is achieved through a systematic series of coursework, research and clinical experience in a variety of clinical neuropsychology settings.

The *Clinical Neuropsychology* major area of study at Fordham is consistent with the goals of the APA Division 40/[Minnesota Guidelines'](https://theaacn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MNC_Guidelines_Final.pdf) recommendations for doctoral education and training in neuropsychology. These goals seek to advance the study of brain-behavior relationships, and the clinical application of that knowledge to human behavior.

Requirements of the major area of study include completion of the clinical psychology core curriculum, along with completion of a minimum of three courses within the neuropsychology major area of study, at least two externships in *Clinical Neuropsychology*, and predoctoral or doctoral research in a topic related to neuropsychology.

The primary goal of this program is to train students on how to integrate information about brain-behavior functioning in research, clinical assessment, and intervention in a variety of settings working with populations vulnerable to neurological injury or illness. Our students have the opportunity to train with different clinical populations (e.g., epilepsy, aging, brain injury) at a variety of externship settings around NYC. Students also have the opportunity to participate in enriching didactics (e.g., WADA testing observation, brain cuttings, neurology rounds, neuropsychology journal clubs) at many of our research and clinical sites. Ultimately, we see our students going on to thriving neuropsychology careers in academia, research, and clinical settings and encourage our alumni to pursue board certification in clinical neuropsychology.

### Faculty

Our *Clinical Neuropsychology *major area of study faculty includes primary, affiliated, and adjunct faculty. Consistent with APA Division 40/Houston Guidelines, our students have the opportunity to work with outstanding neuropsychologists, including many who are board-certified.
