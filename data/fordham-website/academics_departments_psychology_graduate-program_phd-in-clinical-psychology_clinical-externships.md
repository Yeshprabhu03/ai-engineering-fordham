# Clinical Externships for Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology

We strive to provide our students with a well-balanced and diverse training experience, working with a wide range of psychological disorders, populations, and mental health delivery systems. This flexibility enables students to achieve the level of competence in clinical assessment and intervention needed to obtain a competitive APA-approved internship placement, while still pursuing specialized training in any area of interest.

Beginning in the fall semester of the first year students identify, apply for, and interview at ten externship sites in consultation with their mentor, the associate director of clinical training (DCT), and DCT.

Beginning in the second year and continuing in the third year, students spend a full academic year at one externship site. Most fourth year students elect to complete an additional year of externship training while working on their dissertation in order to add further depth or breadth to their clinical training and further strengthen their readiness for an APA-approved internship. Many students opt to complete summer externships in order to supplement the breadth of their training or develop additional specialized skills.

Fordham students historically have obtained highly competitive and enriching placements at many of the most prestigious training sites in the New York City area. These externships have provided opportunities for our students to train in inpatient and outpatient hospital settings, community and private clinics, school/college counseling centers, VA centers, correctional institutions, and more.

Although our official externship database is only released to our own doctoral students, most of the local externship sites and application information are listed on this publicly available wiki page: [https://nynjadot.apa.org/](https://nynjadot.apa.org/)
