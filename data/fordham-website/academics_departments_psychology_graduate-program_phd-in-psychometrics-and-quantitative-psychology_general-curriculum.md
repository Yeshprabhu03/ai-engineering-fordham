# General Curriculum for Ph.D. in Psychometrics and Quantitative Psychology

The Psychometrics and Quantitative Psychology (PQP) program at Fordham University focuses on the quantitative, research-oriented commonalities relevant to most behavioral sciences and their applications in industry, education, and health sciences. Students in the PQP program gain familiarity with a repertoire of statistical, measurement, psychological testing, and other research techniques, as well as relevant computational skills.

Upon graduation, PQP students should be able to take on jobs in basic and applied research in the social and behavioral sciences, as well as in the testing industry and a range of program evaluation functions. Sophistication in measurement and evaluation can provide employment opportunities consonant with the current social emphasis on increasing standards of performance, equality of opportunity and accountability in the delivery of human services such as mental health services, education, and selection and training programs in industry.

PQP students are expected to demonstrate substantial grounding in general psychology as well as their concentration in psychometrics and quantitative psychology. They interact regularly with faculty and students in the other psychology doctoral programs (applied developmental and clinical).
