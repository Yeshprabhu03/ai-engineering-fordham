On Wednesday, October 8th, join Fordham’s Psychology Department and over 70 psych departments across the world in promoting small random acts of kindness to demonstrate the positive benefit that kindness can have on both those who receive the acts and those who engage in acts of kindness. Let’s show the world how Fordham does it!

Join us by performing good deeds for yourself, others, and our community--then stop by our tables at Rose Hill and Lincoln Center to share your good deeds with our community, log them on the international PSYC [Good Deed Tracker](https://umdsurvey.umd.edu/jfe/form/SV_6EBEmUb0Jbz7FkO), and pick up some kindness swag! We will also be collecting canned food donations for [Grupo de Mujeres Latinas](https://belmontcatholiccommunity.org/gml), a program through the Belmont Catholic Community supporting immigrant Latina women in the Bronx!

Use #PSYCGoodDeedDay2025 throughout the day to share Fordham’s good deeds on social media!

This event is hosted by Fordham’s Rose Hill Psychology Club, Lincoln Center Psychology Club, Lincoln Center Psi Chi, and the Department of Psychology.
