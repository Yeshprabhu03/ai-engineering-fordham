We encourage Psychology students to take advantage of the wide range of clinical, research, educational, and community-based internship opportunities available in New York City. Psychology majors and minors have been successful in securing internships at hospitals, mental health clinics, research labs, schools, non-profit organizations, and social service agencies. In the past five years, our students have interned at: Montefiore Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, NYC Department of Education, Good Grief, Inc., The Child Mind Institute, Fordham Psychology Research Labs, and various community mental health organizations, among many others.

Some internships earn students college credit. Some internships are paid. Most internships involve 10–20 hours of work per week.

Students must register their internship with the Fordham Career Center and consult with their Academic Advisor in the Fordham College Academic Advising Center about their plans.

Students are expected to have completed a minimum of 60 hours of coursework and hold a GPA of 3.0 or above in order to be approved for college credit. (Exceptions can be made for students in good academic standing.)

Be aware that psychology-related internships—particularly in clinical, hospital, and research settings—are very competitive. Applying for and securing an internship often takes 3–4 months and requires initiative, professionalism, and in some cases background checks and onboarding requirements. The Fordham Career Center can help you compose a résumé and guide you through the process. Psychology faculty can also offer valuable advice and practical tips for achieving success. We are here to help!

While it can be challenging to land an internship, the process of seeking, applying for, interviewing for, and holding the internship itself provides outstanding preparation for graduate school and the job hunt after graduation. Experience gained and connections made through undergraduate internships often serve as springboards to future careers in mental health, research, education, healthcare, and human services.

#### How to Proceed

Start by making an appointment at the Fordham Career Center. You can make an appointment either at Rose Hill or Lincoln Center directly through the Career Center website.

As you pursue internship opportunities, the staff of the Career Center can:

- Help you create a résumé
- Provide guidance on how to correspond with potential employers
- Coach you for online and in-person interviews

You will search for internships through online recruiting platforms and websites. The principal ones are:

There are also specialized job platforms for psychology and human services. We encourage you to explore these:

[Idealist](https://www.idealist.org/)[PsychologyJobNetwork](https://www.psychologyjobnetwork.com/)[APA PsychCareers](https://psycjobs.apa.org/)[Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/)- (search “psychology intern,” “mental health intern,” “research assistant,” etc.)

Also, investigate the Jobs and Careers sections of the websites for:

- Hospitals and healthcare systems
- Mental health clinics
- School districts and special education programs
- Non-profit and community service organizations
- Other industries

Also, be aware that Fordham has partnered with some New York institutions to create the Serving the City internship program. These opportunities are paid and can be searched using a “Serving the City” tag through [Handshake](https://fordham.joinhandshake.com/).

People sometimes find internships by word of mouth. Don’t be afraid to ask other students, alumni, or faculty members if they know of any internship opportunities.

Your peers can be a great resource through this process. A great way to get to know other Psychology students outside your classes is through student organizations such as the Psychology Club, Psi Chi (the Psychology Honor Society), and research labs.

#### Internship For Credit Process

Once you have an internship offer, you will need to consult with:

Your official Advisor at the [Fordham College Advising Center](/academics/undergraduate-education/advising/fordham-college-advising/). If your Academic Advisor approves the internship, you will have a meeting with one of the internship instructors from the Career Center.
