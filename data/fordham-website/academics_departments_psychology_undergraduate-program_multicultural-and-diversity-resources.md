# Multicultural and Diversity Resources for Psychology Majors

Consistent with the [American Psychological Association’s Guidelines for Undergraduate Psychology Major](http://www.apa.org/ed/precollege/about/psymajor-guidelines.pdf), we provide students with the knowledge, skills, and values required to recognize, understand, and respect the complexity of social, cultural, and individual diversity. Consequently, we offer psychology courses covering topics such as ethnic/racial identity; sexual and gender identity; effects of discrimination, harassment, and group bias on health and well-being; psychosocial roots of prejudice and hate crimes; and health disparities.

In addition to these themes being infused across the psychology curriculum, all psychology majors are required to complete a designated Diversity course to advance Fordham’s missions of cura personalis and men and women for others. Diversity courses are designated advanced (3000) or capstone (4000) courses that: highlight aspects of individual and cultural diversity and the interpersonal challenges that often result from diversity and context, assist students in recognizing potential for prejudice and discrimination in oneself and others, and explore how psychology can promote civic, social, and global outcomes that benefit others.
