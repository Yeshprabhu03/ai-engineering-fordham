# Research Information for Psychology Majors

Because psychology requires both research and application, our program inculcates research skills through varied research opportunities beginning in your required courses and continuing with work in faculty labs and in independent research. Learn about the diverse and exciting research options for psychology majors.

### Research at Fordham

There are ample resources to support student's research ideas at Rose Hill and Lincoln Center campuses. Fordham hosts an Undergraduate Research Journal, which provides you with an important forum to present the results of your research. Additionally, you may request grant funding for your research projects, and you will find multiple avenues to disseminate your research through the Undergraduate Research Symposium.

### Research in the Psychology Department

Our department integrates research requirements and opportunities into coursework. Moreover, we offer various independent study options throughout your undergraduate study experience.

Courses with a Research Component:

All psychology courses involve some aspect of research or methods, and the lab courses provide more in-depth research expectations and production to apply research methods to the overall theories of the course topic. Lab courses in the course listing end with the number 1 (i.e. PSYC 2201-Learning Laboratory, is the lab course equivalent of PSYC 2200-Learning)

For more detailed course descriptions of the following courses, please refer to the [ Undergraduate Course Listing](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/undergraduate/psychology/#coursestext):

- Foundations in Psychology (PSYC 1200): One goal of the Foundations of Psychology course is to provide an opportunity to become acquainted with the process of research in psychology. Therefore, as a part of the Foundations course, students will be expected to satisfy a research requirement. To fulfill this requirement, students will be asked to spend a total of three hours engaged in research-related activities, such as attending research presentations or participating in research studies on campus. Learn about the full details of the Research Requirement.
- Statistics (PSYC 2000): This course covers descriptive statistics and (parametric and nonparametric) inferential statistics. It emphasizes mastery of statistical concepts and utilization of statistical software. Lab component every other week emphasizes research skill building.
- Research Methods Lab (PSYC 2010): A hands-on introduction to research methods in psychology. In the lab, students will replicate classic studies from different areas of psychology, analyze the results, and write APA-style lab reports.

Advanced Lab Courses: Courses on a variety of topics with a research lab every week: Cognition Lab, Learning Lab, Memory Lab, etc.

- Social Psychology (PSYC 2600) or Social Psychology with Lab (PSYC 2601): This course involves research on social relationship formation, nonverbal behavior, attitude change, and group processes. Research will be conducted using laboratory designs, survey research, and observational techniques. Students will analyze the results, and prepare APA-style lab reports.
- Infant and Child Development (PSYC 2700) or Infant and Child Development lab course (PSYC 2701): An introduction to the study of change in cognitive, personality, and social processes across the life span. Students will conduct both laboratory and naturalistic observations, analyze the results, and prepare APA-style lab reports.
- Independent Study (PSYC 2999-4999): Advanced students can receive course credit for pursuing an independent research study in supervision with a faculty member to guide the learning and research process.

### Honors Program

As members of our prestigious psychology honors program, undergraduate students may be eligible to conduct their own thesis from conceptualization, research design, and implementation, to data collection, analysis, and thesis writing. The thesis project is completed in conjunction with a faculty member of the Psychology department.

### Research Opportunities

The professors in the psychology department are involved in various ongoing research projects that are diverse in scope and topic area. Professors often seek assistance from interested and committed undergraduate students who wish to gain training and experience in psychological research.

Faculty research opportunities are a good avenue for a student to pursue Independent Study course credit.

Faculty often mentor students with whom they have worked on senior honors theses. Please refer to the
[Faculty and Staff](/academics/departments/psychology/faculty-and-staff/) to learn more about individual faculty members' current research and reach out to professors to inquire about opportunities to get involved.
