Fordham's sociology and anthropology degree is valuable for students planning careers in diverse fields:

- social research
- criminology
- social psychology
- public administration
- education
- social work

It also provides a useful background for those planning to enter law, other professional fields such as medicine, community planning, architecture, and many others.

The synthesizing nature of both sociology and anthropology allows it to work well as a double major with other areas of the humanities as well as the natural and social sciences.
