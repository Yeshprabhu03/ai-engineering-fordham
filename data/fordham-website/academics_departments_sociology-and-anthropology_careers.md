# Sociology and Anthropology Careers

## Why Major in Sociology or Anthropology?

Sociology and anthropology courses offer intriguing and diverse course content (from the structure of international art worlds to the emergence of the U.S. prison state to the rise of zombie culture) and significant skills development (surveying and statistical methods, network analysis, interviewing, ethnography and content analysis, to name but a few).

Sociology and anthropology majors go on to pursue rewarding career opportunities that allow them to remain committed to social and economic justice. And for students who wish to pursue advanced degrees, both sociology and anthropology provide tracks to doctoral programs, as well as paths to advanced degrees in law, education, social work, and public policy.
