Religious worlds, Jewish Studies, gender, language, childhood, media, and public scholarship.

My ongoing research agenda ethnographically investigates contemporary North American Jewish identities and languages. My scholarship engages key issues at the intersection of religion, Jewish Studies, gender, and linguistic anthropology, including language and media.

I am also the founding director of the Demystifying Language Project
