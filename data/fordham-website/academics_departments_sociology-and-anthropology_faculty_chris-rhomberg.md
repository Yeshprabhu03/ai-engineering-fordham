Chris Rhomberg works in the areas of urban and political sociology, race and ethnicity, labor and labor movements, and historical methods. His first book, No There There: Race, Class and Political Community in Oakland (University of California Press, 2004) received the 2006 Robert E. Park Award for best book in urban and community sociology from the American Sociological Association, and his second book, The Broken Table: The Detroit Newspaper Strike and the State of American Labor (Russell Sage, 2012), received the 2013 best book award from the ASA section on Labor and Labor Movements. Among his articles are “A Signal Juncture: The Detroit Newspaper Strike and Post-Accord Labor Relations in the United States” (American Journal of Sociology, Vol. 115, No. 6, May 2010: 1853–94), which received the 2010 Distinguished Scholarly Article Award from the ASA section on Labor and Labor Movements and was co-winner of the 2011 Distinguished Scholarly Contribution Award (Article) from the ASA section on Political Sociology.

His research has centered on issues of race, labor, and urban politics in American political development, and on workplace organization and labor relations in the United States. Methodologically, he is interested in narrative forms of sociological explanation and problems of representing collective agency, topics explored in his article “Class and Collective Action: Writing Stories about Actors and Events,” Sociología Histórica, Vol. 1, No. 3, 2013: 93-116 [also translated as “Clase y Acción Colectiva: Escribir Historias sobre Actores y Eventos,” in the same issue.]

Current projects include a study of the production process in cultural or creative industries, inequalities in urban labor markets and the organization of work, and emerging forms of workers' mobilization for change.
