I am a cultural and medical anthropologist whose research interests encompass science and technology studies, critical race studies, reproductive health and politics, and bioethics and social justice. My book, Transnational Reproduction: Race, Kinship, and Commercial Surrogacy in India (NYU Press, 2016), is the first to foreground issues of race and racialization in the context of transnational surrogacy in India. In the book, I argue that ideologies of race lie at the heart of transnational family-making, illuminating the intersections of race, power, kinship, and inequality in the context of transnational gestational surrogacy. The book is based on long-term ethnographic fieldwork in India with Indian surrogate mothers, Western intended parents, and egg donors from around the world, as well as doctors and other actors.

My research and writing have been supported by multiple sources including the National Science Foundation, the Wenner-Gren Foundation, and the Ford Foundation. My current research explores the social meanings of race, identity, and DNA in the context of gamete (egg and sperm) donation among Asian Americans in the United States.
