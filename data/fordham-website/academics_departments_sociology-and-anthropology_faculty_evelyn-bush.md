Evelyn Bush is a sociologist whose research has centered on the interplay between religion and rationality, particularly the various forms of confrontation and collaboration between religious organizations and large-scale secular institutions. Her past research has focused on how the rules, norms and assumptions of secular political bureaucracies, particularly the United Nations and the U.S. Department of State, shape religious actors’ strategies for asserting influence in the field of human rights. Recently, her research focus has shifted to the terrain of professional sports, and the role that religious ministries play in either ameliorating or exacerbating the potentially dehumanizing effects of hyper-rationalization on athletes within the National Football League. Throughout her research, Dr. Bush has written on the measurement challenges inherent in the use of quantitative data to study religion.

Dr. Bush spent this past year (AY 2017/2018) on sabbatical, collecting quantitative and qualitative data for a new project, which focuses on how religion shapes the lives and careers of professional athletes, particularly in the NFL. This summer, she is embarking on the second stage of this project, which entails fieldwork designed to further explore findings from the quantitative portion of the study.

Dr. Bush’s previous research has focused on religion and international institutions. Most recently, she was a core collaborator on the "Religious NGOs at the United Nations" project, which was a 3-year multi-methods study funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council and housed at the

[University of Kent – Canterbury](http://www.kent.ac.uk/scholarships/postgraduate/research_council/ahrc.html). This collaborative effort culminated in a book, titled*Religion, NGOs and the United Nations: Visible and Invisible Actors in Power,*which was edited by the project P.I., Jeremy Carrette, and published by Bloomsbury Press (2017). -
