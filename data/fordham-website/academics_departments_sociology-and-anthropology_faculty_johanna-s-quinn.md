Johanna S. Quinn is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Fordham University. As a former New York City public school teacher, educational theories feature centrally in the three strands of her research, which seek to understand: 1) how race, gender, and class inequalities intersectionally shape school workplace experiences for school employees, 2) how individuals, groups, and organizations contribute to producing, reproducing, and challenging inequalities, and 3) how educational programs can best support youth thriving. Her work is collaborative, incorporating feminist and critical epistemologies and employs a wide range of methods, including ethnography, interviews, surveys, and textual analysis. Recent scholarship from her work appears in Gender, Work, and Organizations, Research in Human Development, Socius, and the Journal of Adolescent Research and has been supported by multiple fellowships and grants, including a Ford Foundation Fellowship, a National Academy of Education/Spencer Foundation Fellowship, an American Association of University Women Fellowship, and the William T. Grant Foundation.
