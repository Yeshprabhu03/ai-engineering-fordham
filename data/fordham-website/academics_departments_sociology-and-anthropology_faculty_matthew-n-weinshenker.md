I am a family sociologist and a social demographer with special interest in the contemporary practice of fatherhood and in work-family issues. I have been a faculty member of the Fordham Sociology and Anthropology department since 2006. I am also a faculty affiliate of the Women's Studies program, on whose executive board I currently serve.

My past research has examined adolescents' expectations about parental employment and divisions of labor in their adult lives, the determinants of the United States' comparatively high child poverty rates, and the impact of becoming a first-time father on the employment hours of men of varying ages. My current research examines the impact of parents' employment at "non-standard" hours (e.g. evening, night, and rotating shifts) on family life.
