# Department of Theatre and Visual Arts

**Welcome to the Department of Theatre and Visual Arts!**

Dear Visitor,

Thank you for visiting the website of Fordham University’s Department of Theatre and Visual Arts! Whether you are a prospective student, a current member of our community, or simply curious about our programs, we are excited to share with you the vibrant and dynamic world of creative expression that thrives here.

Our department is a place where students explore their passions in either theater or visual arts, while also engaging deeply with the world around them. We are committed to cultivating artist-citizens—individuals who not only excel in their craft but also understand the social impact of the arts and their role in promoting empathy, dialogue, and justice.

In the **Theatre Program**, we offer rigorous training in [performance](/academics/departments/theatre/training/performance/), [directing](/academics/departments/theatre/training/directing/), [playwriting](/academics/departments/theatre/training/playwriting/), and [design and production](/academics/departments/theatre/training/design-and-production/), with a focus on socially engaged storytelling. Through hands-on experiences, our students learn to create works that address the pressing social issues of our time. Our productions and curriculum reflect this commitment, helping students explore how their art can contribute to building stronger, more connected communities.

The **Visual Arts Program** offers students the opportunity to work across a variety of media, including painting, video, photography, and socially engaged arts. With access to state-of-the-art facilities, students can experiment with new forms of expression that speak to contemporary societal challenges.

Throughout both programs, we emphasize the importance of using art as a tool for social engagement. We challenge our students to think critically about the role of the arts in society and to create works that inspire conversation, provoke thought, and contribute to the common good.
