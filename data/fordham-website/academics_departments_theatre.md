I'm impressed at the diversity of Fordham. There's a variety of types and styles and ways of thinking. It feeds into a very refreshing, creative energy... And the camaraderie between students in the Theatre Program is inspiring.

The high quality of training shows in the students' work, which is of the caliber of a graduate program. In last year's senior showcase, I saw an individual approach to character, which demonstrated great inner depth.
