# Admission, Auditions, and Interviews

The Fordham Theatre Program is an undergraduate Bachelor of Arts degree that offers four areas of study for theatre majors: Performance, Design and Production (D&P), Playwriting, and Directing.

Along with your University application, we ask prospective Theatre Program students for additional information that aligns with each of the four Concentrations. There are three steps to providing this information:

## Step One

Submit your application for admission to Fordham University.

Once you have applied, you will receive credentials to log into the Online Applicant Portal after the Office of Admissions has acknowledged receipt of your admission application via email - this can take 2-3 days. Once you receive your credentials, please log into the Online Applicant Portal and find the section called Portfolio or Materials. This is where you will upload your pre-screening materials.

## Step Two

Prepare and submit your materials for your pre-screening application to the Fordham Theatre Program.

Select one of the four Concentrations and prepare its specific materials for submission. Learn more about each Concentration’s submission guidelines in the links below:

[Performance Concentration](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/departments/theatre/admissions/performance-concentration-auditions/)[Design and Production Concentration](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/departments/theatre/admissions/design--production-concentration-interviews/)[Playwriting Concentration](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/departments/theatre/admissions/playwriting-concentration-interviews/)[Directing Concentration](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/departments/theatre/admissions/directing-concentration-interviews/)

Once you submit your materials, Fordham University Theatre Program faculty will review them on a rolling basis. Prospective students will be notified individually if selected for a callback. We ask that all applicants reserve time for their preferred audition day(s) in advance.

## Step Three

Participate in an in-person interview/audition at your callback.

Participants that are called back will meet individually with the Head of the Concentration, where you will have the opportunity to share your work in your discipline. These interviews will be held in person or virtually. In the interview, we’ll discuss you, your education goals and how the Fordham Theatre program may fit into those goals.

While you may be accepted into the program through one Concentration, there is no obligation for you to remain in that Concentration. Many students learn during their education that they prefer another Concentration over the one they were accepted into the program with. Regardless of your Concentration, you’ll receive a well-rounded undergraduate education that will prepare you for many different aspects of working, creating, and thriving in the theatre.

We also offer a [theatre minor](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/departments/theatre/training/theatre-minor/) for undergraduate students, which does not require an audition or interview.

## Prescreening and Callback Procedures

*We strongly encourage all prospective students to attend their interview/audition in-person*. We feel that we will learn the most about you, and you will learn most about the program, while we are together in-person in the same room. However, if you are unable to attend in-person, we will make a live, virtual audition or video audition available to applicants by request. Please contact [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#97e3fff2f6e3e5f2d7f1f8e5f3fff6fab9f2f3e2) to inquire after virtual or video audition.
