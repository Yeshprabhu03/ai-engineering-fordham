New Play Dramaturgy

Michael Walkup is the Artistic Director of Page 73, a Tony- and Obie Award-winning theater company producing playwrights’ first professional premieres in New York City and developing the work of early-career playwrights who have yet to receive such productions. Page 73’s co-production of A Strange Loop by Michael R. Jackson won 2022 Tony Awards for Best Musical and Best Book of a Musical as well as the 2020 Pulitzer Prize. Other recent world premieres include La Race by Bleu Beckford-Burrell; Man Cave by John J. Caswell, Jr.; STEW by Zora Howard (2021 Pulitzer Prize Finalist); and Catch as Catch Can by Mia Chung. Michael has been at Page 73 since 2011 and worked with over 100 playwrights through production, an annual Fellowship, and leading the Interstate 73 early-career writers group. He also teaches a First Draft Playwriting course at Primary Stages’ Einhorn School for the Performing Arts. Michael previously worked in new play development and dramaturgy at Yale Repertory Theatre; he received his MFA in Dramaturgy and Dramatic Criticism from Yale School of Drama and BA in Theater Studies from Penn State University.
