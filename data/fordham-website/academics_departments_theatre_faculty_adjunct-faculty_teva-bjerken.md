**About**

Teva Bjerken teaches the Alexander Technique to performers, bringing her career in dance to the art of performance. She trained and was certified by the American Center for Alexander Technique (ACAT) and served as an assistant teacher at both Juilliard and Mannes School of Music. She is also faculty in the College of Performing Arts at The New School. Her dance training included the scholarship program at American Ballet Theater, the high school division of North Carolina School of the Arts, and Sarah Lawrence College. As a member of Codanceco (NYC), she served as both collaborator and performer in many dance/theater pieces. She has performed at the American Dance Festival, Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, Los Angeles Opera, Dance Theater Workshop, La Mama, The Kitchen, and P.S. 122. Teva collaborated with fellow AT teacher Belinda Mello in the writing of, "Cultivating a Lively Use of Tension: The Synergy between Acting and the AT." which appears in the Routledge journal 3.1, Theater, Dance and Performance Training. She was instrumental in developing and producing the inaugural conference, "Freedom to Act; Acting and the Alexander Technique '' in January 2012 in New York City and has been a presenter several times. Teva has completed two of four modules towards her CMA certification at the Laban/Bartieneff Institute for Movement Studies in NYC and participated in "Deepening Your Teaching Artist Practice'' with Lincoln Center Education. Teva continues to develop her somatic practice as a member of “Blank Slate,” a group of six dancers who meet regularly to engage with movement improvisational scores.
