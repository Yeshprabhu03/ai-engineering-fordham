# Design and Production

The Design and Production track offers focused concentrations in Set Design, Costume Design, Lighting Design, Projection Design, Sound Design and Stage Management. Our diverse community of Faculty and Students, representing a broad scope of identity and experience, work to tell stories as a way of speaking to our unique moment of historic challenge and change. We reevaluate the theatrical event, learning and growing through an experiential, hands-on curriculum, with an emphasis on curiosity, risk-taking and collaboration across all artistic disciplines. The first two years of the program provide the foundations of theater-making, with an emphasis on conceptual thinking and visual story-telling. Contemporary and classic texts are analyzed and interrogated. Historical perspectives are always contextualized and rigorously reexamined. Focused upper-level courses hone the skills of all Management and Design disciplines.

Design and Production students have numerous opportunities to work with peer and professional collaborators. In our student-produced studio shows, and our professionally directed and designed mainstage productions, we develop the collaboration skills that will become the framework for an evolving creative practice.

Graduating students in the Design and Production track represent their efforts in the annual Design and Production Showcase and Showcase Website, sharing their work and experiences with professional directors, designers, managers and producers.

Our faculty are working theater-makers who offer a wide range of experience, inspiration and opportunity.

-
**Curiosity, Critical Thinking and Continuous Learning:**Design and Production Students are exposed to a wide array of stylistically and globally diverse curriculum and pedagogies, building the foundation for an ongoing journey of personal and intellectual discovery. Our curriculum provides the discipline-specific tools for management and design student’s growth and learning during our four years together, and far beyond.

**Activism and Social Justice:**Design and Production Students engage with contemporary social issues to imagine how to think about the communal theater experience as a tool for activism. In the process, our students each build a strong ethical foundation, based upon global perspectives and personal integrity. As they build worlds for the stage, they learn tools for how to do so with kindness, authenticity, cultural competence, respect and sustainability.

**Collaboration and Process:**Theater is a collaborative art; individual Theater-Maker’s imagination and creativity contribute to the success of the whole. Communication and empathy are essential, so our Design and Production Students actively engage with

*all*Theater disciplines. In that process they learn an experimental, holistic approach to both aesthetics and craft. Student-produced Studio productions promote dedication to the team-work that leads to opening night.**Risk and Artistic Freedom:**Every theater practitioner must be self-reflective: “Who am I?” “What do I stand for?” “How might my work promote the difference I hope to make in the world?” Fordham Theater provides a respectful, supportive and joyful space for each Manager and Designer to tackle these questions, empowering students to ultimately share their own unique perspectives. This can be challenging work, but also

*the*crucial goal for a life in the arts.**Technical Skills:**Design and Production Faculty are professional Theater-Makers who are actively engaged with the New York City and Global Theater Communities. Classes in Theater Management, Production Management, Stage Management, Design & Conceptual Foundations, Drafting and Drawing, Set Design, Lighting Design, Costume Design and Sound Design are structured to provide an incubator for individualized artistic exploration while ensuring students master the essential practical skills specific to each discipline. Classes are the “training-ground”. Productions provide real-life, hands-on, experiential learning.
