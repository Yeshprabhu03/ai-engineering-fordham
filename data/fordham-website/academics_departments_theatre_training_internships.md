# Internships

Fordham Theatre at Lincoln Center campus is located in the cultural heart of New York City, just steps away from the Broadway and Off-Broadway theatre districts. Theatre majors intern at leading theatre, film, and television venues. Frequently, a Fordham theatre major will intern with an organization, be hired by them upon graduation, and then bring other Fordham theatre majors on as interns in the years that follow.

A few internship success stories:

- Theatre major Willa Burke interned for Jujamcyn Theaters during her junior and senior years. They offered her a full-time job upon graduation.
- John Johnson interned as a student in the offices of Liz McCann, Joey Parnes, and the Tony Award Productions. He was hired upon graduation and now, as an associate producer, regularly recruits Fordham theatre students as interns. In her junior year, Madeline Felix, worked as an intern with Johnson on the Tony Awards, and at the end of her senior year, she also was hired as the assistant to the director of Tony Award Events.
- Greg Balla interned with Blue Man Group while he was studying at Fordham. He was soon hired as part of the run crew. This led to his audition for the Boston production; he got the job and began performing in the Boston production immediately after he graduated.
