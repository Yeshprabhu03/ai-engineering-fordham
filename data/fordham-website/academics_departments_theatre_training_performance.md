# Performance

**The performance concentration is centered in Stanisklavski's late work with physical actions. The training also includes voice work with Linklater and Fitzmaurice techniques, and movement work in disciplines such as Alexander, Feldenkrais, and Butoh. We know that learning is experiential; actors grow by working on stage. That is why we produce four mainstage productions and twelve studio productions a year. During their senior year, actors take a Senior Audition class taught by a professional New York City casting director to provide them with the knowledge to start a professional career. This is followed by a video showcase of scene work for agents and casting directors that exposes them to contacts in the industry.**

**Curiosity, Critical Thinking and Continuous Learning**:Performance students cultivate a spirited sense of joy and imagination and exploration of self through physical storytelling, creative play, improvisation, and personal and collective reflection. Through an exposure to a wide-range of globally and stylistically diverse plays, styles of teaching and pedagogies, performance majors learn a variety of approaches to acting and gain skills to critically analyze their craft which contributes to lifelong learning.

**Artist Citizen and Social Justice**:Performance students learn how to understand and empathize with human experiences outside their own through intensive study of character, and analytical study of a variety of texts. Students build engaged communities, a pillar of a healthy society, by working together towards a common goal and finding deep emotional connections in the process. Through deep connection with experiences that expand across cultures, socioeconomics and circumstance, actors use their craft as a means to engage deeply with contemporary social issues and foster empathy.

**Collaboration and Process**:Collaboration across theatrical disciplines and within the acting cohort is practiced in all four years of the program. Actors gain effective communication skills through ensemble work, practical exercises, workshops and hands-on learning. They learn how to give feedback that can challenge and inspire fellow collaborators; develop a playful detachment from individual ideas and an ability to revise work radically; achieve a basic understanding of all theatrical disciplines in the classroom; and connect with an ensemble. With an emphasis on experimentation, actors learn that the process of creating artistic work is as important as the final product.

**Risk and Artistic Freedom**:In a brave and supportive learning environment, actors learn how to personalize the text and character circumstances, practicing courageous empathy and deepening vulnerability in performance. Actors learn how to create story with their imaginations and bodies and are challenged to devise and pursue innovative theatrical projects.

**Technical Skills:**Through classwork, labs, rehearsals and productions, actors develop key foundation skills, including: active listening and stage presence; physical exercises that enhance awareness, flexibility, and strength; relaxation techniques for ease in performance; ability to use language effectively to express thoughts and intentions; in-depth textual analysis; articulation and commitment to objectives and physical actions; physical embodiment of a character; audition technique and preparation; professional etiquette in a rehearsal and production environment.
