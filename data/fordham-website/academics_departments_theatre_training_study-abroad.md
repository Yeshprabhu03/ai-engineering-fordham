### Bard Summer Theater Intensive in Berlin

This program, which began in 2015, is a one month intensive during which students explore techniques in the devising and

creating of original theater works. Students study a variety of ‘methods’ of creation with Berlin-based artists and, under their

guidance, make original pieces throughout the program. Students are also immersed in the cutting-edge theater and culture of

Berlin, seeing 14 to 16 performances reflecting the variety and depth of Berlin’s extensive theater scene. Students will also

explore the historical and contemporary richness of Berlin’s culture and society with faculty from Bard College Berlin.
