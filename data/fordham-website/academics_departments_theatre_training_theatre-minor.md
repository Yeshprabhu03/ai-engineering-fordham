# Theatre Minor

The Theatre Minor is recommended for students who want a strong, general education in theatre while majoring within another program or department. While you cannot officially declare a theatre minor until your sophomore year (after declaring a major), you can begin work on the minor now. You must contact [Elizabeth Margid](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?fs=1&tf=cm&source=mailto&to=margid@fordham.edu) in order to declare your minor.

A student can officially declare a theatre minor in his or her sophomore year only after declaring a major. No D grade work will be credited toward the minor in theatre.

The minor in theatre is available at Fordham College at Lincoln Center and Fordham College at Rose Hill. Fordham College at Rose Hill students should note that the majority of theatre minor courses are offered only on the Lincoln Center campus. Students in Fordham's School of Professional and Continuing Studies may minor in theatre only if they receive the approval of their advising dean and/or department, and their schedules are sufficiently flexible to permit them to take day courses at the Lincoln Center campus.

These learning goals are designed to ensure that students pursuing a Theater Minor gain a foundational education that balances practical skills with theoretical knowledge and fosters both personal and professional growth.

**REQUIRED CLASSES (not electives):**

Invitation to Theatre - This is the entry class for minors. You must begin here.

2 Global Theatre Histories (I & II) We'd prefer that these history classes were taken in order, but it is not necessary.

3 semesters of THEA 1000: Theatre Practicum

5 Theatre Electives - For a list of electives, see below.

If you're a first-year, you will take a maximum of two theatre courses during your first year (one course per term): Invitation to Theatre and an elective.

If you're a sophomore or junior, you can take an elective and Invitation to Theatre during the same term.

If you're interested in the Performance major, you will get the chance to audition (or re-audition; students are eligible to audition one more time if they auditioned previously and were not accepted into the program) at our Fall Open House, or in the spring of your first or sophomore year* (after meeting with the theatre administrator). Please be aware that through this path, there is an acceptance rate to the major of approximately ten percent. (Go [here](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/departments/theatre/admissions/) for audition dates).

Again, all theatre minor questions can be directed to Elizabeth Margid at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

No D grade work will be credited toward the minor in Theatre.

As a theatre minor, you are eligible to audition for all studio and mainstage productions, as long as you are in good academic standing and are registered and/or have completed THEA 1000.

We have bi-monthly Theatre Program meetings, or “Town Hall,” with all students and faculty. Please attend these meetings to keep up to date on all theatre events.We have a group email list for sending out announcements. You can join this group email list once you have declared your minot.

If you have trouble registering for any of the theatre minor courses, contact Elizabeth Margid at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Provide the name of the course, the course registration number (CRN), and your ID number. She will arrange for you to be manually registered.
