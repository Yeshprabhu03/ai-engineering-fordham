###### "Fordham Theology is a supportive, intellectually stimulating, justice-oriented community of study. I am a better scholar, teacher, and human being because of the six years I spent there. My professors introduced me to an exciting interdisciplinary range of ideas and helped me find my own scholarly voice. They modeled a contagious collegiality that allowed for a similar culture among graduate students -- I learned as much from my peers as I did from my professors. I also received excellent mentorship that prepared me well for a competitive job market. I try to carry the values that so enriched my time at Fordham into the various professional spaces I am now lucky enough to inhabit."

She holds a BA from Georgetown University, an MTS from Boston College's School of Theology and Ministry, and a PhD from Fordham University.
