###### "I will always appreciate the quality of theological education I received at Fordham. My professors were exceptional in their respective fields of expertise. As a Protestant, I am particularly appreciative of the broadening of my 'theological toolbox,' as I read the works of Roman Catholic scholars, which contributed to my ability to engage in current ecumenical dialogue. I am especially grateful for the lasting friendships that were forged during my time there."
