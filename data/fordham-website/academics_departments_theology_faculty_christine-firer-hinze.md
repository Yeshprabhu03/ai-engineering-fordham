She holds a BA in religion and an MA in theology from the Catholic University of America, and a PhD in Christian social ethics from the University of Chicago. Her teaching and research focus on foundational and applied issues in Christian social ethics with special emphasis on the dynamics of social transformation, Catholic social thought, and economic and work justice for vulnerable women, families and groups.

She is the author of Comprehending Power in Christian Social Ethics (Oxford, 1995), Glass Ceilings, Dirt Floors: Women, Work, and the Global Economy (Madeleva Lecture Series, Paulist Press, 2015), co-editor (with J.

Christine was born in Chicago and raised in the city of Detroit, where she served in inner-city ministry and taught high school prior to her doctoral studies. She taught at St. Norbert College and Marquette University prior to her 2006 appointment at Fordham. Christine and her husband Brad, also a theologian, are the parents of two adult sons, longtime members of Ignatian Christian Life Communities (CLC), and members of Our Lady of Angels Parish, Bronx, NY.
