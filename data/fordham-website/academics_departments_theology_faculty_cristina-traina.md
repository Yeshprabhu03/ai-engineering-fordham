Professor Traina’s research focuses on critical and constructive Christian feminist ethics, with a specialty in Catholic ethics. Areas of special expertise include sexuality, ethics of relationship, methodological questions, and moral agency, in particular children’s moral agency. She has additional interests in bioethics, migration, intersectionality, and economic and political justice.

In her current project, Children Out of Place and Moral Agency, she explores the implications for ethical conceptions of moral agency of children who are “out of place” according to Western liberal notions of childhood. Each instance demands a different revision of moral agency and of childhood, and each questions American assumptions about and practices of childrearing and education. They include children who work for pay; children who migrate unaccompanied; children who are recruited by armies and gangs; children active in labor movements and politics; and children who must decide how to respond to intersex or transgender identity.
