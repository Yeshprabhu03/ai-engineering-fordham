Emanuel Fiano received an undergraduate degree in Religious Studies from Sapienza University of Rome and went on to earn an MA and a PhD in Early Christianity from Duke University’s Graduate Program in Religion (with Certificates in Interdisciplinary European Studies and in College Teaching). During his graduate training, he was a Summer Fellow at Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection and studied as a Visiting Researcher at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, at the CNRS in Paris, and, as a Charlotte W. Newcombe Doctoral Dissertation Fellowship holder, at UC Berkeley. Most recently, Fiano has been a Research Fellow at Dumbarton Oaks. He has taught Italian, Biblical Hebrew, and the history of Christianity at Duke and at Elon University. The courses he has been teaching at Fordham include Sacred Texts of the Middle East; Ancient History; Syriac language and literature; Coptic language and literature; Jews and Christians in Antiquity; Ancient Theological Controversies; and Law and Religion in Antiquity—in addition to graduate tutorials on subjects germane to his research interests.

Fiano researches the intellectual history of late ancient Christianity, with a particular focus on Syriac and Coptic literature, on religious controversies, on Christian-Jewish relations, and on canonical production. His first monograph,

*Three Powers in Heaven: The Emergence of Theology and the Parting of the Ways*, forthcoming in June 2023 from Yale University Press, examines the relevance of the fourth-century debates about Christ’s relationship to the Father—also known as Trinitarian controversies—for the so-called “parting of ways” between Christianity and Judaism. The project on which he is currently at work centers on the interplay between law and theology as domains of discursive production in early Christianity and aims at redescribing their role in the establishment of an orthodoxy-based public order in the late Roman empire (with forays beyond the*limes*). -
