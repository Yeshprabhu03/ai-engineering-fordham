Trained as a feminist theologian, Prof. Hill Fletcher is interested in how religious identity is constructed and mobilized in a pluralistic world. Her current work focuses on how White Christian theology can be oriented toward anti-racist projects for the thriving of diversity in the U.S. context. Her most recent book, The Sin of White Supremacy: Christianity, Racism and Religious Diversity in America investigates the history of theological thinking informing legislation and envisions Christian symbolism as a resource for transformative politics and activist practice.

The investigation of racism and religious diversity builds on her first bookMonopoly on Salvation? A Feminist Response to Religious Pluralism, which puts Karl Rahner and George Lindbeck in conversation with feminist theories of identity for a theology of religious pluralism. Her second book,Motherhood as Metaphor: Engendering Interreligious Dialogueasks how women’s interfaith engagement might serve as a site for a renewed theological anthropology. As a constructive theologian, Prof. Hill Fletcher is interested in an inductive method that begins from ‘on-the-ground’ experience as a point of departure for theological reflection.Motherhood as Metaphor incorporates data from the archives of Maryknoll women in mission, diaries, letters and speeches from the secular women’s movement, and ethnographic research with a women’s dialogue group in Philadelphia.
