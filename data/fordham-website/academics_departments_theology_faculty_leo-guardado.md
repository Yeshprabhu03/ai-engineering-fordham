Prof. Leo Guardado was born in the mountains of Chalatenango, El Salvador during the


country’s civil war. Forced to leave El Salvador as a boy, he grew up in Los Angeles,

California and attended college in the bay area. An interest in monastic life took him to live

for a time in the Cistercian (Trappist) Abbey of Our Lady of New Clairvaux in Vina, CA before

pursuing a Master of Theological Studies (MTS) in patristics at the University of Notre Dame.

He later worked ecumenically in the Tucson, Arizona borderlands with churches, dioceses,

and NGOs, collaborating across theological and political differences in solidarity with

migrant communities. He has a PhD from the University of Notre Dame in both systematic

theology and international peace studies, a joint program between the theology

department and the Kroc Institute at the School of Global Affairs at Notre Dame. -

**Forced Displacement & Refuge**: Leo’s first book,*Church as Sanctuary*(Orbis, 2023) thinks theologically, and more particularly ecclesiologically, about the concept and practice of church sanctuary (church asylum) for persecuted persons. The book first analyzes the theological and philosophical foundations of the 1980s sanctuary ministry as envisioned by the communities in the Arizona borderlands, a ministry that quickly became a transnational movement. Around the same time in the 1980s, the Roman Catholic Church also removed any reference to church sanctuary/asylum from its Code of Canon Law, an action that, in light of growing forced displacement around the globe, invites us to rethink the theological, and more particularly, the sacramental nature of sanctuary/asylum and its place in the church.**Healing**: How do migrant communities in New York City address the multidimensional wounds of migration and of living under persecution in a country that seeks their deportation? This is one of the guiding questions that guides Leo’s ethnographic research with Latin American families who seek out traditional healers and their knowledge. Although Roman Catholic churches in the US typically do not recognize the healing practices and rituals of curanderismo as part of its pastoral and sacramental/liturgical experience, for many Latin American Catholics, their faith can only be expressed genuinely through the rituals and practices that have shaped them and that give them a true sense of health and home amid displacement. This research considers the ways that migration forces differently inculturated Catholicisms to coexist, and how this lived reality questions ecclesiology, sacramental theology, and liturgy.**Nonviolence**: Since at least the middle of the 20th century, the Latin American church, theologians, and key bishops in the region engaged in sustained reflection on gospel nonviolence and its connection with Gandhian approaches to the transformation of conflict. Leo’s research on nonviolence builds upon this history and upon previous works that are located at the juncture between Gandhian philosophy and Latin American liberation theology. This research is also focused on understanding how nonviolence is part of Pope Francis’ pastoral and theological vision for the church. Amid institutionalized violence, there is an invitation to continue to think creatively about nonviolence at the communal and ecclesial level, and to integrate this style of politics into the life of the Church.**The legacy of Gustavo Gutiérrez**: Leo worked closely with Fr. Gustavo Gutiérrez, Peruvian theologian who passed away on October 22, 2024. He regularly teaches a doctoral seminar focused solely on the thought of Gutiérrez, inviting students to carefully and critically engage his writing and theology. Leo is the editor of Gutiérrez’ posthumously published book titled,*Vivir y pensar el Dios de los pobres*(2025). -
