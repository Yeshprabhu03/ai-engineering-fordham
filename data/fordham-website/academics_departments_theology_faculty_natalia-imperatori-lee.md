**Biography**Natalia Imperatori-Lee is Associate Professor of Systematics with a focus on ecclesiology, feminist theologies, and Latinx theologies. She holds degrees from the University of Notre Dame (Ph.D., 2007) and the University of Chicago (M.A., 2000), in addition to her B.A. from Fordham (1998). Dr. Imperatori-Lee’s most recent book,

*Women and the Church*, is an overview of feminist theology intended for the undergraduate classroom, as this is where her interest in theology really began. Her previous work,*Cuéntame: Narrative in the Ecclesial Present*, sought to understand the church in a narrative frame, focusing on stories and storytelling in and about the church. Frequently, the story of the church that we hear (ecclesiology) obscures the histories and insights of marginalized and minoritized communities. Cuéntame is an attempt to re-orient contemporary Catholic ecclesiology away from idealized characteristics and toward the ambiguity inherent in history. Dr. Imperatori-Lee’s current research is on women’s credibility in and outside the Catholic Church.Dr. Imperatori-Lee arrives at Fordham (her undergraduate alma mater) after 19 years of undergraduate teaching. She has published articles on the church’s mistreatment of women scholars, on the perils of complementarity, and on Mariology in Latinx communities. Her work has appeared in Theological Studies and The Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion. She also regularly contributes to Catholic journals like America and Commonweal. She is a frequent speaker at colleges, parishes, and other popular venues on the topic of women and the church. She has taught courses on Vatican II, feminist theology, sexuality and the sacred, and women in Western religion. She has also served on the board of the Catholic Theological Society of America and of the Academy of Catholic Theologians of the US. When she is not working, Natalia enjoys cross-stitch, historical romance novels, and visiting botanical gardens. She lives in the Bronx with her husband, Michael, and her two children, William and Benjamin.
