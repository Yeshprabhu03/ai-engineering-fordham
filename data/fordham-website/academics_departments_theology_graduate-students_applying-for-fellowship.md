# Applying for Theology Fellowship

### Guide for the Perplexed

The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) offers [three distinguished fellowships](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/financial-support/fellowships/distinguished-fellowships/) that increase your funding, reduce your work responsibilities, and strengthen your CV. These fellowships also provide a means of extending your funding beyond the five years guaranteed by the Department of Theology.

Specific information about these fellowships, including deadlines, is posted by the end of November. The submission deadline is typically around the beginning of the spring semester in mid-January.

Keep the following tips in mind as you write your application for any of these fellowships:

- Most of the faculty reading your application are probably not closely familiar with your discipline. Avoid jargon in your statements or proposals. Imagine you are writing for
*Commonweal*rather than*Theological Studies*.

- Keep your recommender in the loop and be considerate about deadlines. Give as much notice as possible. Send draft narratives or statements for your recommender’s reference several weeks before the deadline. Write a thank-you email or note when you learn whether you have received a fellowship.

- Seek out advice! Ask students in the department who have attained fellowships for tips. Be in touch with your advisor, and don’t hesitate to seek feedback on your application materials.

There are three full-year fellowships. Specific information about each is listed below.
