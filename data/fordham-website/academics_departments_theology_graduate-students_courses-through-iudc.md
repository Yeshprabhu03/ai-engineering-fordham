# Courses Through IUDC

### Guide for the Perplexed

You can register for doctoral-level courses at other universities in the New York area that are relevant to your studies and research interests. Fordham has reciprocal agreements with members of the Inter-University Doctoral Consortium (IUDC), which includes Columbia, Graduate Center at CUNY, NYU, the New School, Princeton, Rutgers, Stony Brook, and Teacher's College at Columbia.

There are some restrictions for taking courses outside of Fordham:

- You must have completed at least a year of PhD coursework.
- You can take only one consortium course each semester.
- You can’t take IUDC courses during the summer.
- You must take the course for credit.

Follow these steps to register for a consortium course:

- Check with your advisor and the Associate Chair of Graduate Studies to confirm that you’re eligible to take a consortium course and that the course you want to take fits your program and research interests.
- Download and print the
[Inter-University Doctoral Consortium Registration](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/pdfs/jadu-single-folder-pdfs/inter_university_doctoral_consortium_registration.pdf). - Gather the necessary signatures:

- The Home Institution Chair or Program Director is our Department Chair, but bring your request first to the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies.
- The Home Institution Consortium Coordinator is Associate Dean Sara Lehman (
[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2041444753415360464f524448414d0e454455)). - The course instructor. An email from the instructor indicating approval is sufficient.
- The Host Institution Consortium Coordinator. To get contact information for an institution chair within the NYTC, ask Associate Dean Sara Lehman or Executive Assistant Carmela Menta. You can obtain this signature electronically by sending a scan of the form by email. For help with scanning, please talk to Executive Assisstant Sue Perciasepe in the department office.

- Once you have all necessary signatures, return the completed form to the Associate Dean.
- When you complete the course, you need to obtain an official record of your grades from the Host Institution Chair and submit it to the Associate Dean in order to get credit.
