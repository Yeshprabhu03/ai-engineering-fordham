### Biography

Allison Cryer is a first-year PhD student with an interest in Hebrew Bible, particularly using the lenses of animal studies, ecocriticism, and women and gender studies. Allison’s interest in the ancient world began with her undergraduate studies at Wellesley College and the University of St Andrews, where she focused on the Classical world. That interest extended to the Hebrew Bible while pursuing her MDiv from Union Theological Seminary, where she was a two-time recipient of the James Muilenburg Prize in Biblical Scholarship. Allison’s pastoral experience includes being a student minister for a Unitarian Universalist congregation in New Jersey and providing chaplaincy services for patients in hospice and their families in the Bronx and Manhattan.

A native of Northern New Jersey, Allison spends as much time outside as she can with her husband and two children in their Upper Manhattan neighborhood.
