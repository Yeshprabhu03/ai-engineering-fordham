### Biography

Ana Avalos-Chavez is a doctoral student in Systematics. She is originally from the Ciudad Juarez/El Paso borderland and misses the desert skies and mountains every day. She holds a Bachelor of Arts in Religious and Theological Studies from St. Edward’s University in Austin, TX., and a Master of Divinity from Harvard Divinity School. She is a proud McNair Scholar alumnus and a current ACHTUS and AAR member.

She loves to think about monsters, language, and stories and how they connect with religion. More specifically she is interested in sacramental, feminist, latinx/e, and queer theologies. Those interests converge in her interest in sacramentality and the role of the body, material, and food. Her current research project is focused on the La Virgen de Guadalupe as a theological figure. In particular, she is interested in reimaginings of La Virgen de Guadalupe in Chicana art, and how her image is used in political movements.

Ana Avalos-Chavez teaches the core theology course “Faith and Critical Reason,” and one day hopes to teach a class dedicated to studying theology and food. She loves to talk about pop culture and theology; *Derry Girls* is her constant obsession. She is a NY/NJ Gotham NWSL supporter, go Bats! Most importantly, she is the proud owner of a chunky corgi named Addie.
