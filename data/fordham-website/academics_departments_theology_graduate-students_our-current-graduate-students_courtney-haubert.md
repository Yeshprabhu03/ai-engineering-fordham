**Biography **

Courtney Haubert is a PhD student in Systematic Theology at Fordham University. Her research centers around exilic and diasporic Orthodox Christian identities, especially in conversation with Orientalism, colonialism, and imperialism. One of her main interests is the reception of post-Revolutionary Russian Orthodox political theologies among Middle Eastern Christian communities. She is also interested in analyzing shifts in North American Orthodox identity as it is reflected in English-language catechetical media and pedagogy. Prior to coming to Fordham, Courtney received an MTS and Certificate in Religion and Public Life from Harvard University and a BA in Philosophy and Psychology from Baylor University. She also completed a Fulbright Grant in Bulgaria from 2022-2023. Outside of work, Courtney enjoys learning languages, crafting, cooking, folk dancing, and exploring New York City with her fiance, George. **Publications **
