**Biography**

E. David de Leon resides in New York City with his two sons and wife. Originally from the San Francisco Bay Area, he is a child of Pilipino immigrants. His research examines Christian doctrines of providence and eschatology as deployed in colonial, imperial, and civilizing projects with a particular eye toward histories of Spanish and American colonialism in the Philippines and the lives of diasporic Pilipinos. His additional research interests include postcolonial and decolonial theory, psychoanalysis and its extension into ideas like racial melancholia, Asian American studies, Pilipinx American studies, and more. He thinks, writes, and teaches along the lines of Asian American and Pilipino American theology. He has extensive experience in Christian ministry settings, with over 12 years in university campus ministry work, immersion learning programs, and church music ministry. Now in his fifth year at Fordham, he is an instructor for Faith & Critical Reason, teaching a class that attempts to forge a productive relationship between religious studies and theology.

David is a runner, an avid cook, and is a fan of carbohydrates in solid and liquid forms. He is an experienced bread baker whose sourdough starter is now almost a decade old. His favorite ice cream flavor is Pistachio from Arethusa in New Haven, CT.
