**Biography:**

Hangoul (pronounced *Han-Gyear* / 한결) was born and raised in South Korea within the Korean Methodist Church. Her research is deeply informed by her experiences as a woman navigating questions of power, biblical interpretation, and their influence on women’s self-image and mental health.

She critically examines patriarchal and misogynistic concepts within the Bible and investigates how certain interpretations can perpetuate harm or violence, particularly against women and girls. Passionate about integrating biblical studies with ethnography, Hangoul grounds her research in women’s lived experiences, seeking to understand how faith, identity, and power intersect in real-life contexts.

Her diverse ministry experiences have significantly shaped her academic journey. She has served as a **resident chaplain** at Emory University Hospital, an **educational pastor** in Korean immigrant churches, and a **refugee program manager** in Thessaloniki, Greece.

Outside of her academic work, Hangoul is a proud mom of a vibrant, funny, and energetic preschooler. She is excited to begin her journey at Fordham, where she looks forward to exploring her research interests more deeply and becoming rooted in collaborative learning cohorts and community.
