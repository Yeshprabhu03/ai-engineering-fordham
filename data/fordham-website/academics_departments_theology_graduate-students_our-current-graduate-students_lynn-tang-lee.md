### Biography

Lynn is a doctoral student in Systematic Theology. Her current research interests examine the interlacing of Christian theology and poetics as a deepened way of transformation and ethically responding to the ruinous effects of coloniality. She wonders whether reading and writing theo-poetics can not only transform experience and imagination but begin to change a human being towards Christological form (correlated to being and action, not literal). She grounds her theological approach in the theory that theology can convey itself more fully through a particular, poetic way of writing; and that poetic writing can create a heretofore unexpressed theology, and even create a new theological language. To put it another way, how something is written “does” as much as what is written.

Along with her research interests, Lynn has a deep and abiding love for the craft of writing fiction, especially literary short stories. She is always on the lookout for a new-to-her book which fills her with wonder.

Lynn’s work in parish and church settings over the past couple of decades has always included helping people to pray, as well as to engage in spiritual formation practices. She trained at the Jesuit Retreat Center of Los Altos in accompanying others in the 19th Annotation of the Ignatian Spiritual Exercises. She has worked as a spiritual director since 2020.

Some of Lynn’s most joyful pastimes include reading, running, taking long hikes, drinking good coffee, deep conversations with others, spending time with her family, and enjoying theater and ballet performances. She currently lives in Yonkers with her spouse and two children.
