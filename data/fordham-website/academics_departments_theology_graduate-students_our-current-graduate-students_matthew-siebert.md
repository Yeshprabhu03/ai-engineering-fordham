## Biography:

Matthew is a doctoral student in Judaism and Christianity in Antiquity. Born and raised in Des Moines, IA, he received a Bachelor of Arts in Religious Studies and Psychology from Beloit College, and a Master of Arts in Religion in Bible from Yale Divinity School. His primary research interests lie in ancient conceptions of the body and physiology, within both medical texts and popular discourse, and the influence of these conceptions on the development of early Christian theologies. Other interests include Pauline studies, Jew-Gentile relationships within nascent Christianity, and the applicability of Marxist conceptions of social relations and class to the ancient world.

He currently lives in Inwood with his partner and their two cats Oliver and Quinn.
