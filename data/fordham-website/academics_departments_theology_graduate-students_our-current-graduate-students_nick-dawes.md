### Biography

Nick is in his second and last year of the inaugural MTS program. He initially attended Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, PA, where he played football for a year before retiring and making his way back to Columbus, OH, his hometown. Once there, he attended The Ohio State University, where he specialized in Marketing and minored in history. Upon graduating, he entered into his family business and learned from the most incredible group of individuals ever assembled since the 1992 US men’s Olympic basketball team. He worked for two years, learning from the best and racking up a plethora of experiences along the way before finding himself in one of the greatest cities in the world besides Columbus…NYC.

Through the program, he is concentrating on Modern Church History. He is fascinated by the intersection between the Vatican, the US government, and the Catholic Church in America. Within that, he has found particular interest in Vatican/US diplomacy during periods of war, along with its impact upon American society politically, socially, culturally, and spiritually.

He is a former indoor volleyball team captain of a “better than their record showed” team, an average golfer, an above-average putt-putt player, and an even better frolf enthusiast. He also loved basketball, tennis, and pickleball in the city. Plus, he continues to live up to his glory days playing touch football, trying to avoid injuries and thriving in Madden. He is a massive cinephile, loves to cook and read, and enjoys a wide variety of good music.
