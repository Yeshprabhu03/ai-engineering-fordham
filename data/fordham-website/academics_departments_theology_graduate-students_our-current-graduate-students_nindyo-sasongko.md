### Biography

As an Indonesian and Anabaptist, I have interests in the fields of peace theology, culture, and spirituality. Having grown up in a former colonized country and a context of ethnic and religious pluralism, I also have an interest in the topic of ecumenical ecclesiology in a post-colonial context. Before coming to Fordham, I taught as an Elias-Pohan Visiting Scholar at Jakarta Theological Seminary and published in journals such as the *Toronto Journal of Theology*, *Dialog, Ecclesiology*, and *International Review of Theology*. Until now, I am also an Editor at the Indonesian Journal of Theology.

I also love teaching, both in church and classroom contexts. At Manhattan Mennonite Fellowship, I was appointed as theologian in residence accompanying theological discussions such as Theology on Tap. Apart from that, in 2018, I also founded the theology podcast @Theovlogy which provides theological education for both the Indonesian context and beyond. At Fordham, I have enjoyed teaching courses such as Faith and Critical Reason, Christ in World Cultures, Church in Controversy, Christian Mystical Texts, and Scripture and the Struggle for Racial Justice; and because of the success of using online teaching tools such as Blackboard and Perusall, I received Fordham's Teaching Award honorary mention, 2023.
