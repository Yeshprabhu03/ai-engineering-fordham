**Biography**

Rodrigo is a lay Salvadoran theologian, formed in the tradition of liberation theology. His

academic and pastoral experience spans diverse settings: as an online education tutor,

professor, and researcher, always committed to fostering dialogue between faith and

historical reality. Rodrigo is particularly interested in the category of care as a

hermeneutical key for doing theology from the concrete experiences of people,

especially in contexts of vulnerability and resistance. He grew up in El Salvador, a

country marked by deep social wounds and by the active hope of those who struggle for

justice; this reality has shaped both his sensitivity and his conviction that theology must

be born from daily life and walk alongside communities that dream of a more dignified

world. When he is not at Fordham, he is at UCA in San Salvador.
