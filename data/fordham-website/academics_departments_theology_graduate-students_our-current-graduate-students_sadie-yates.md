**Biography**

Originally, from Charlottesville, VA, Sadie Yates is currently a first-year doctoral student in Theology at Fordham University. Her research interests include lived Catholicism in the modern era in the U.S. and Latin America, especially as it relates to popular devotion and cultural religious symbols, as well as Catholic feminist theologies. Her work seeks to articulate a theology done ‘from the ground up,’ one that takes seriously the real, embodied experiences of individuals and communities. Sadie holds a B.A. and M.A. in Theology from the University of Notre Dame, where her thesis examined Catholic inculturation in the Andes based on ethnographic and archival research in Puno, Peru, and an M.T.S. from Boston College. She also has experience working in parish ministry. When she is not doing theology, Sadie is an avid hiker, an amateur ballet dancer, and a lover of good books and strong coffee.
