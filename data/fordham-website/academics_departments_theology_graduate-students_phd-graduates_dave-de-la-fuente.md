David de la Fuente graduated with a PhD in Systematics from the Department of Theology at Fordham University in July 2024. He is a part-time lay pastoral associate at the Church of St. Paul the Apostle in New York City. He completed his undergraduate studies in political science and theology at Fordham University in 2010 with an honors concentration in American Catholic Studies and a Master of Theological Studies degree at the Boston College School of Theology in 2012. Subsequently, Dave worked for four years as the patient advocate for the Institute for Head and Neck and Thyroid Cancer at Mount Sinai Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City. He has also served as a Campus Minister for Fordham's Retreat Ministry.

Dave's dissertation project, titled *A Catholic Reception of Azusa Street’s Pentecostal Fire*, engages Pentecostal historiography and theology of the Azusa Street Revival of 1906 in tandem with the philosophical hermeneutics of Paul Ricoeur and the theological hermeneutics of Willie James Jennings in order to develop an anti-racist pneumatology that crosses ecumenical borders.
