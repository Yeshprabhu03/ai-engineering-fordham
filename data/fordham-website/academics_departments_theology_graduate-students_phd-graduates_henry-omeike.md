# Henry Omeike

Henry Omeike graduated with a PhD in Theological and Social Ethics from the Department of Theology at Fordham University in Spring 2024. His dissertation explored Africa’s understanding of community and its relationship to economic identity and participation, especially as embodied in the Igbo (African) Imu- Ahia economics, and its implications for modern Catholic social teaching's view on economic solidarity.

Henry is a contributor on the Junior Scholars’ segment of the [ The First](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/the+first+january/FMfcgxwKkHhQmbfFJkrVqfHfKvFmFzMS), the monthly newsletter of Catholic Theological Ethics in the World Church. He is the founder/coordinator of Truelife Consult of Nigeria (TLK), a platform he has used to gather and to train a broad spectrum of people across Nigeria and abroad, especially youth, on self-improvement through workshops on leadership, physical as well as emotional health.

Henry has served as associate pastor, offering spiritual and pastoral care to individuals and communities in many parts of the world and has worked as secretary, electoral presider, director of students and community organizer in his native country, Africa, and the U.S. He currently lives in Washington DC with his family.
