Jack Pappas graduated with a Ph.D. in Systematics from the Department of Theology at Fordham University in Spring 2024. He is a systematic theologian with primary research interests at the intersection of fundamental theology, continental philosophy of religion, and theological metaphysics. Jack's dissertation focused on the theological reception of Martin Heidegger in the thought of Karl Rahner and Hans Urs von Balthasar and its influence on recent French phenomenologists such as Jean-Luc Marion, Jean-Yves Lacoste and Emmanuel Falque. Jack is also interested in patristics, theological and philosophical hermeneutics and the influence of personalist philosophy on modern Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic theology.
