James Dechant defended his doctoral dissertation in Systematic Theology in Fall 2023. The project marries critical pedagogy with patristic Christian claims about anthropology and the natural world in order to advance liberative eco-praxis and cultivate solidarity. In collaboration with his colleagues in the Department, James launched [Open Windows](https://openwindows.ace.fordham.edu/), an online publication devoted to theological pedagogy from the perspective of graduate students who teach. A native Kansan and a former English teacher in the Bronx and Japan, he currently lives in Westchester County with his incredible wife and three beautiful children.
