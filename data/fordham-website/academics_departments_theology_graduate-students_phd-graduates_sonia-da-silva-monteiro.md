Sónia graduated with a PhD in Systematics from the Department of Theology at Fordham University in Fall 2024. She is a systematic theologian with research interests in the areas of christology, ecclesiology, political theology, and philosophical and theological hermeneutics. Sónia’s dissertation offers a constructive reading of the phenomenon of interpersonal forgiveness in light of a theology of creation, while considering its implications in the public sphere. Before moving to New York, Sónia worked as a lawyer in Portugal, with interests in criminal justice. Sónia is an active member of The Grail, an international and ecumenical movement of lay women from diverse backgrounds founded in 1921.
