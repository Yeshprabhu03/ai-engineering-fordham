**The Master of Theological Studies program is not accepting applications for 2026.**

Fordham’s Master of Theological Studies (MTS) degree will allow you to engage in critical and constructive theological research while immersing yourself in this distinguished department's vibrant community of scholarly inquiry.

Our intensive, four-semester program is rigorous, interdisciplinary, and focused. You will gain a comprehensive foundation in Theology and Religious Studies as you pursue your own research. Designed to equip students for advanced doctoral study, the program also provides excellent preparation for a variety of careers requiring deep theological and religious competence.

In our increasingly mobile and interconnected global society, the ability to come to terms with theological complexity and religious difference is a vital skill. On complex issues such as ecological crisis, economic disparity, sexual, racial, and gender bias, and war and peace, theological and religious study offers a unique platform for deep understanding and constructive analysis. Whether you wish to pursue textual, linguistic, or historical studies, constructive theology, comparative religion, religious ethics, or something else, our program will prepare you for the next stages of your academic and career journey, and to make meaningful contributions to a more wise and just world.
