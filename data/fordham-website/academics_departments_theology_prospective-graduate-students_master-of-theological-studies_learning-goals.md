# Learning Goals for Master of Theological Studies

Upon completion of the program:

- Students will demonstrate a familiarity with and competency in four major areas of theological study: scripture, history, systematics, and ethics.
- Students will achieve advanced proficiency in one of two areas of concentration: Studies in Ancient and Medieval Theology/Religion or Studies in Modern and Contemporary Theology/Religion.
- Students will be competent in historical, theoretical, and methodological approaches to contemporary research in theology/religion and recognize the manner in which that research interacts with other disciplines in the humanities and sciences.
- Students will demonstrate reading proficiency in one modern language (normally German, French, or Spanish). If appropriate to a student’s field of study, they will also demonstrate proficiency in one or more pre-modern languages (e.g., Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Coptic, Aramaic, Syriac).
