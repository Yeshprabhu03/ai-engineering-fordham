# Theology Undergraduate Students

## Why major or minor?

When students announce they’re considering a minor or major in theology, we know the question that often follows: “But what on earth will you do with **that***?”* So what **do** Fordham students do with their theology degree, after they graduate? We love this question, and we invite you to learn our answers for it from

- our "
[Why Theology?](/academics/departments/theology/undergraduate-students/why-theology-/)" page, - our
**undergraduate website****,** - our undergraduate co-chairs,
- our esteemed
[faculty](/academics/departments/theology/faculty/), and - our distinguished
[alumni](/academics/departments/theology/alumni-and-friends/).

We are so proud of the thousands of students who have pursued a theology major or minor at Fordham, and are in awe at the range of places theology has taken them after graduation. We invite you to join them by joining us.
