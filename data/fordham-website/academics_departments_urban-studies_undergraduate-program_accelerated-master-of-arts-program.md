# Accelerated Master of Arts Program in Urban Studies

Urban Studies majors with a GPA 3.2 or above may apply for early admission to the Urban Studies MA Program in the second semester of their junior year.

Students admitted to the Urban Studies masters program under the early admissions policy will take the two 5000-level required core courses during their senior year (Issues in Urban Studies and Urban Political Processes). These courses will count toward the Bachelor’s degree (which is awarded at the end of the 4th year) and are accepted for the Masters, which can be completed by the May of the following year under full time study.
