Student exhibition in the Ildiko Butler Gallery

Located just steps from some of the biggest museums and galleries in the world, our on-campus exhibition spaces offer students the rare opportunity to show their work to the public. Each spring semester, our spaces are dedicated to solo and two-person Senior Exhibitions; their jam-packed opening receptions are among the University’s annual highlights.

From May through February, the galleries host faculty-curated shows that feature work by established and emerging contemporary artists, designers, and architects. Our students work directly with these professionals in mounting their exhibitions and also are invited to attend guest lectures, panel discussions, and other related events.

Please see our [gallery homepage](http://fordhamuniversitygalleries.com/home.html) for a full listing of current and past exhibitions.
