# Fordham Student Film Festival

The Fordham College Lincoln Center Film Festival takes place every semester on the evening of the last day of classes. Students fill SL 24 L, our state of the art screening room, to watch a selection of films created in Visual Arts production classes. This non competitive film festival is curated, introduced and presented by students each semester.
