New York City offers a wealth of opportunities for you to gain professional experience in tandem with your studies, which are not only personally and professionally enriching; they often lead to employment after graduation. Some may be credit-bearing as well. Juniors and Seniors wishing to earn credit for an internship may sign up for **VART 1800, 2800, 3800 or 4800 - Internship (1-4 credits)**.

Some common venues for paid and unpaid internships have included The New Yorker, Anthropologie, the Whitney Museum of American Art, Marvel Comics and Random House, as well as graphic design or architecture firms, individual artists’ studios, ad agencies, and film distribution cooperatives.

Our faculty will help you connect to the institution or business that’s right for you. Explore additional possibilities through [Fordham’s Career Center](/resources/career-resources/career-center/).

[Senior Exhibitions](/academics/departments/visual-arts/program-highlights/senior-exhibitions/)

If you would like to present a senior exhibition, you would submit a portfolio to **Junior Review** in April of your junior year. Students who pass Junior Review are admitted to Senior Seminar (VART 4600), an intensive critique-based course for credit in which Visual Arts majors develop their thesis projects. In December, the course culminates in a group exhibition of these projects in Fordham’s Lipani Gallery; the **Senior Review of this work** is used to award the Spring exhibitions.

Students who do not take the Senior Seminar may still participate in the Senior Review and, if given faculty approval, may complete a senior thesis. Contact [Stephan Apicella-Hitchcock](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#80e1f0e9e3e5ecece1e8e9f4c0e6eff2e4e8e1edaee5e4f5) or talk to your area of study advisor for more information about Junior Review, Senior Review, Senior Seminar and Senior Exhibitions.

Applications for travel grants are due in April and are reviewed by the entire Visual Arts faculty. Contact your advisor for more information on compiling your portfolio and submitting your itinerary, budget, and other required information.

**Documentary Photography Credits**

Two documentary photography courses are offered for credit: one in Japan (VART 3001) between the fall and spring semesters, and one in Rome (VART 3005) during summer break. Each course concludes with the production of a book that presents your course projects.
