# Visual Arts Study Abroad

Many visual-arts majors spend a semester of their junior year finding inspiration abroad. For a complete list of opportunities, see our [Study Abroad](/study-abroad/) office.

The Visual Arts Program also offers two trips abroad for credit. One, to Japan, takes place in the winter between semesters. The other, to Rome, takes place in the summer.

**VART 3001 – Documentary Photography: Japan** (4 credits)

This intensive class is designed as a platform for intermediate- and advanced-level students to further develop their photographic production with an emphasis on generating documentary projects focusing on the people, culture, and architecture of Japan. The megacity of Tokyo serves as the starting point for our photographic investigations, as well as the catalyst for discussions addressing the historical significance of the documentary impulse. The course includes an excursion to Kyoto and concludes with the production of a book of students’ photographic projects.

**VART 3500 – Documentary Photography: Italy** (4 credits)

This intensive class introduces you to the basic and advanced techniques of image production with an emphasis on generating documentary projects directly relating to the people, culture, and architecture of Italy. The cosmopolitan city of Rome, rich in artistic history, serves as the starting point for our photographic explorations, as well as the catalyst for discussions addressing the historical significance of the documentary impulse. The course concludes with the production of a book of students’ photographic projects.

**Travel Grants**

Travel grants are offered to sophomores, juniors, and first-semester seniors for independent research. Up to four Ildiko Butler Travel Awards are given annually for work in the medium of photography. Susan Lipani Travel Awards are given to two students to pursue research in other concentrations. We’ve had students who’ve ridden the Trans-Mongolian Railway, crisscrossed Northern India, traveled through Cuba, and photographed the aurora borealis in Iceland. Our department is committed to providing the financial resources you need to explore the world around you.
