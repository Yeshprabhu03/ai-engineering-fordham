# Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Program

Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies is a bi-campus multidisciplinary program with a profound social justice goal: to understand how gender and sexuality shape our culture, daily lives, social institutions, and interactions.

Our program brings together over 50 faculty from from 13 departments and programs across both campuses, professors whose research and teaching focus on women, gender, and/or sexuality. In addition to offering dozens of courses across the social sciences and humanities, the program serves as an intellectual center for faculty and students.
