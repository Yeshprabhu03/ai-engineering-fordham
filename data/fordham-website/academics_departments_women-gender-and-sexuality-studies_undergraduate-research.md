# Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Research

Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies program students are actively involved in undergraduate research. Our majors are expected to conduct an independent project in their senior year, and about half choose to complete this requirement by conducting independent research under the mentorship of a faculty member that culminates in a senior thesis and a public defense. Minors may also participate in research opportunities.

Reflecting the breadth of our program and its interdisciplinary nature, our students’ research traverses disciplines and methods. In recent years, our students have written about sex workers, analyzed gendered dynamics in the American political system, and explored constructions of femininity in 19th-century Europe. Our students have also won undergraduate research awards to support their research.
