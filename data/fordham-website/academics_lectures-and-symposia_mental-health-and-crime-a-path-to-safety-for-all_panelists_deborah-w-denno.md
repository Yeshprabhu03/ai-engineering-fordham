**Deborah W. Denno** is the Arthur A. McGivney Professor of Law and Founding Director of the Neuroscience and Law Center at Fordham Law School. Seven of Professor Denno’s articles have been cited by the United States Supreme Court—some multiple times and in different cases—and one article has been cited in three different cases, primarily in conjunction with her scholarship on execution methods. In 2016, the Fordham Student Bar Association named Professor Denno Teacher of the Year. Her forthcoming book, *Changing Law’s Mind: How Neuroscience Can Help Us Punish Criminals More Fairly and Effectively *(Oxford University Press), focuses on her study of how criminal cases use neuroscientific evidence. This same study is discussed in some of her recent articles: “Concocting Criminal Intent,”* *105 *Georgetown Law Journal* 323 (2017); “Neuroscience and the Personalization of Criminal Law,” 85 *University of Chicago Law Review* 359 (2019); “How Courts in Criminal Cases Respond to Childhood Trauma,” 103 *Marquette Law Review* 301 (2019); and “How Experts Have Dominated the Neuroscience Narrative in Criminal Cases for Twelve Decades: A Warning for the Future,” 63 *William & Mary Law Review* 1215 (2022).
