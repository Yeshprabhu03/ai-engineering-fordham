# The Ailey School

## Pas de Deux

The Ailey School and Fordham University are partners in a highly innovative Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree in dance.

The B.F.A. program offers the best of two worlds: the artistic pre-eminence of the official school of the world-famous Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, coupled with an exceptional liberal arts education rooted in the Jesuit tradition of academic excellence. Both institutions are located in New York City's Lincoln Center area—the epicenter of the dance world.
