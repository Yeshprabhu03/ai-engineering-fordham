# Reporting of Outcomes

## Faculty Fellowship Reports

A report on the outcomes from your Fellowship is due at the beginning of the term following the conclusion of your Fellowship period, and brief updates are requested annually in the following five years. These should be submitted via the *Faculty Activity Reporting* system under “Contracts, Grants and Sponsored research – Internal.” Failure to submit this report can result in delayed or denied eligibility for future internal funding.

Additionally, you are required to complete the [Faculty Fellowship Outcome Report](https://form.jotform.com/70184405647154) form online ([https://form.jotform.com/70184405647154](https://www.jotform.com/build/70184405647154)) no later than October 1 or March 1 following the conclusion of your Fellowship period.
