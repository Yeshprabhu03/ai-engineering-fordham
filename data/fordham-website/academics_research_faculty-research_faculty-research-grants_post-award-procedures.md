#### How to Access FRG Funding?

In general, you should use the Fordham Purchasing and Accounts Payable systems for the expenses approved under your grant. This means that you will be submitting purchase orders or check requests accompanied by invoices. In particular, note that you may not pay an individual (such as a Research Assistant or an independent contractor) directly: you must submit paperwork to get them into the Fordham system before they start to work.


To familiarize yourself with university processes for expenditures, you should review the handbooks from Accounts and Human Resources (the Administrator's Manual), available by clicking "Guidance" on the [Office of Sponsored Programs website](/academics/research/office-of-sponsored-programs/). Your department secretary may be able to assist you with the process for the type of expenses you have.
