Dr. Julie Kleinman Book Launch, Sept. 22, 2021

Welcome to the Fordham Africanist Group!

We are an interdisciplinary and eclectic group of scholars, students, and activists whose work, interests, and teaching focus on the wonders and richness of the African continent and its peoples. Our expertise and scholarship are rigorous and span the entire African continent and African peoples in Asia, the Americas, and Eastern and Western Europe.

We publish significant policy papers on our local African communities and cutting-edge research on Africa and its people. We take pride in working among and within the most bustling and diverse African populations in the United States–those of New York City and Essex County, New Jersey. We are leaders within our local communities. And we engage with African and world policymakers and leaders to advocate for Africans and to solve some of the most pressing issues facing Africans in the United States, Africa, and the world.
