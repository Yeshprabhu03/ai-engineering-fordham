**Speaker: Roy Richard Grinker**

**"Nobody's Normal: How Culture Created the Stigma of Mental Illness"**

Monday, April 4, 2022

*The Fordham Distinguished Lecture on Disability is organized by the Disability Studies Program and the Research Consortium on Disability. It is sponsored by the Conference of Arts & Science Deans and the Office of Research.*

In this presentation on his new book *Nobody’s Normal* (W.W. Norton), Roy R. Grinker argues that stigma is a social process that can be explained through cultural history, a process that began the moment we defined mental illnesses and disabilities. But because stigma is not grounded in nature we have the power to eradicate it. Though the legacies of shame and secrecy are still with us today, Grinker argues that we are at the cusp of ending the marginalization of those who have for so long been deemed "abnormal." Grinker infuses this lecture with the personal history of his family’s four generations of involvement in psychiatry, including his grandfather’s analysis with Sigmund Freud, his own daughter’s experience with autism, and his own research on neurodiversity.

Roy Richard Grinker is Professor of Anthropology and International Affairs at the George Washington University in Washington, D.C.
