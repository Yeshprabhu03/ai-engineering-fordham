**Abstract: **** **Assistive Technologies have the potential to empower individuals to accomplish tasks they might not be able to do otherwise. Unfortunately, a large percentage of Assistive Technologies end up unused or abandoned, and many people end up with "solutions" that are inappropriate for their needs. Dr. Hurst is working to help more people gain access to the Assistive Technology they need by empowering non-engineers to “Do-It-Yourself” (DIY) and create, modify, or build their own solutions. In this talk, she will discuss her work understanding the potential and reality of using 3D printing to create DIY Assistive Technologies from both the clinician and end-user perspective. Dr. Hurst will also discuss several of the challenges non-engineers face learning these technologies and our work to overcome them; and the potential to create jobs in this space for people with disabilities.
