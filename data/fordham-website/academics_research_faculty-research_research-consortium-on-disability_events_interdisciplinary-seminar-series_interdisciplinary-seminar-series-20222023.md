## Situated Personhood: Insights from Caregivers of Minimally Communicative Individuals

**By: Laura Specker Sullvian, Ph.D.**

**April 26th, 2023 from 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m.**

Summary:

For caregivers of minimally communicative individuals, providing support in the absence of clearly meaningful responses is ethically fraught. We conducted a secondary analysis of qualitative data from caregivers of individuals who are minimally communicative, including persons with advanced dementia and individuals in disorders of consciousness. Our analysis led to two central claims: (1) Personhood is a threshold concept that is situated, relational, and dynamic; (2) In circumstances in which personhood is difficult to judge, caregivers can “fill the gap” to reach the threshold through a repertoire of strategies. Because personhood is in part an attribution from others, a situational loss of personhood does not preclude restoration, nor does it eliminate moral status.

## Attaining the Tomb: The Social Life of an Eleventh-Century Shrine in the Miracles of St. Maiolus.

**By Scott G. Bruce, Ph.D.**

**February 15th 2023 from 12:30 to 1:30pm **

Summary:

The early eleventh–century Miracles of Saint Maiolus narrated accounts of more than four dozen miracles that took place at the shrine of Maiolus of Cluny in the town of Souvigny, where the abbot died in 994. This article examines the evidence of this little–known source to reconstruct the social life of a popular pilgrimage destination at the turn of the first millennium. It presents a profile of the kinds of people who visited Maiolus’ tomb, including their names, genders, and occupations. Next, it analyses the maladies for which these pilgrims sought relief through the healing power of the saint. Finally, it explores the social networks that facilitated the movement of pilgrims with motor and sensory disabilities from their homes to the abbot’s shrine.

#### By: Yi Ding, Ph.D. and Amanda Siegel

[Lecture Recording Here](https://youtu.be/A31o5-vP0-Q)

Wednesday, November 2nd from 12:30 p.m.-1:30 p.m. EST

Summary: The present study examined the relationship between enrollment in structured support programming and the college adjustment, stress, and coping of a sample of 83 undergraduate college students with learning disabilities aged 18 to 25. Participants completed an online questionnaire composed of the items from the Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire (SACQ), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Ways of Coping Questionnaire WAYS), and selected scales from the Behavior Assessment System for Children, 3rd Edition – Self-Report of Personality, College (BASC-3 SRP-COL). Information was also collected about participants’ grade point average (GPA), family involvement, and extracurricular involvement on campus to control for the impact of these factors. Findings demonstrated that students in structured programming had significantly higher levels of Attachment to Institution and Personal-Emotional Adjustment. In addition, students in programs were found to have significantly higher levels of Self-Reliance. Further, students in programs were found to have significantly lowers of stress than those not receiving support through targeted programming. Collectively, findings emphasize the value in structured support programming for undergraduate students with learning disabilities.
