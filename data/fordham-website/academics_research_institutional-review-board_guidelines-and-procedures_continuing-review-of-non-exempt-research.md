# Continuing Review of Non-Exempt Research

Research that is ongoing requires review at least once every twelve months. (The IRB may require more frequent review, as appropriate to the degree of risk to subjects.) The IRB has the authority to suspend or terminate previously approved research that is not being conducted in accordance with IRB requirements, or that has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects.

The Investigator should submit an electronic copy of the completed Annual Review Form via the Mentor IRB System. This information should be submitted with sufficient time for review and response before expiration of the current approval date, at least one month before the expiration date. On the *Info Page *in Mentor, you will find further instructions on how to submit materials. You may access Mentor IRB from your [my.fordham.edu](http://my.fordham.edu/) account by clicking on Institutional Review Board button located on the bottom of the Employee tab or the lower-right hand side of the Student tab.

Please note investigators will receive notification that their approval will be expiring soon. It is the investigator's responsibility to submit their renewal application in order to avoid a lapse in approval. If a lapse occurs, all human subjects activity should halt until approval has been renewed. If approval lapses, the investigator will have to submit a new submission for review and approval by the IRB committee.
