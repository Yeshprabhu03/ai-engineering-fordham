# IRB Review Notification

The Institutional Review Board will send a written IRB Review Notification via email to the investigator shortly after IRB review, whether full or expedited review.

The Notification will indicate one of the following:

- The protocol was approved as submitted
- Specific revisions requiring simple concurrence by the investigator are required (with the IRB Chairperson or designated reviewer delegated to approve revisions on behalf of the IRB)
- Approval of the protocol is deferred due to IRB requests for substantive clarifications, protocol modifications, or informed consent document revisions (with subsequent review of the responsive materials by a convened IRB).

Any revisions to the human subjects protocol requested by the IRB should be incorporated into the written protocol and materials. In addition, a separate document with point-by-point responses should be submitted addressing the requested revisions.

The Research Compliance Director will certify IRB review and approval to funding agencies, as required.
