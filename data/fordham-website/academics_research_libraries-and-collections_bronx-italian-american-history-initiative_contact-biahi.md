## Interview Information

Interviews take place on Fordham's Rose Hill campus during the week (Monday - Friday) when classes are in session (September - April). They last 1-2 hours and resemble a conversation during which we ask questions about family, language, food, work culture, religious traditions, sports and other pastimes, and music. They will be recorded on audio and video and, with your consent, will be made available online in a digital archive for public and scholarly use.

If you or someone you know is interested in being interviewed, please email Dr. LaPenta at the address listed below.
