Call for Participation

**Symposium on Responsible AI**Sponsored by:

Fordham University

IBM

New York University

AI Alliance


October 16 -- October 17, 2025McNally Amphitheatre

Lincoln Center Campus, Fordham University

140 West 62nd Street, New York City

**Purpose & Significance**The ongoing AI revolution presents unprecedented opportunities and complex challenges for higher education, industry, and society at large. Unlike traditional software systems, AI systems powered by machine learning exhibit two key characteristics:

- Dependence on vast datasets, which raises critical concerns around privacy, data rights, provenance, and bias.
- Non-deterministic outputs, which introduce new risks related to trust, safety, reliability, and security.

Given the growing application of AI across nearly every sector of society, it is essential that we deepen our understanding of both the use and governance of these technologies.

At its core, Responsible AI seeks to foster the development of trustworthy AI systems that promote discovery and informed decision-making for the common good across both cyber and physical domains. Achieving this vision requires interdisciplinary collaboration that spans the sciences, social sciences, humanities, public health, law, business, and education, as well as meaningful partnerships with industry, government, and civil society.

brings together scholars, practitioners, and professionals from across the greater New York City area and beyond to advance this collaborative mission. The event is designed to strengthen cross-institutional networks and foster dialogue around the ethical, legal, and sustainable dimensions of AI. Open to the public and held in person, the symposium will feature keynote speeches, selected paper sessions, interactive workshops, and networking opportunities aimed at building a more responsible AI ecosystem.*The Symposium on Responsible AI*We have confirmed the following four keynote speakers: 1) Ben Brooks, Harvard University; 2) Julia Stoyanovich, NYU; 3) Anthony Annunziata, IBM; and 4) Doni Bloomfield, Fordham University

**Conference Summary and Goals**Global developments at the intersection of migration, immigration, and artificial intelligence (AI) raise urgent concerns about fairness, equity, human dignity, and social justice. Immigrant and migrant populations, often among the most vulnerable, face systemic challenges such as limited access to resources, discrimination, exploitation, and ongoing violations of their dignity and security. The rapid integration of AI into decision-making processes presents both opportunities and challenges, highlighting the critical need to address biases, ensure transparency, and promote accountability to prevent AI from perpetuating injustices in employment, healthcare, law enforcement, and other migration-related sectors.

Building on the success of Fordham University’s 2023 International Conference on Social and Environmental Justice, this international conference seeks to examine the connection of migration, immigration, and AI through the lens of social justice and human rights. It aims to foster meaningful dialogue on creating more equitable and humane systems with marginalized communities to protect rights and leverage responsible AI to advance justice for all.

Through keynote speeches, panel discussions, roundtables, and collaborative sessions, participants will explore actionable and sustainable strategies to promote justice, accountability, and participation in policies and technologies impacting marginalized communities. The conference will provide valuable insights and policy recommendations to ensure human rights are prioritized while responsibly harnessing AI to address pressing challenges in migration and immigration.

**Conference Focus Areas and Topics**This international conference invites participation on a range of topics, with an emphasis on interdisciplinary perspectives on social justice issues in migration, immigration, and AI.

David Chalmers is a University Professor of Philosophy and Neural Science and co-director of the Center for Mind, Brain, and Consciousness at New York University. He is the author of The Conscious Mind (1996), Constructing The World (2010), and Reality+: Virtual Worlds and the Problems of Philosophy (2022). He is a former president of the American Philosophical Association and the Australasian Association of Philosophy. He is known for formulating the “hard problem” of consciousness, which inspired Tom Stoppard's play The Hard Problem, and for the idea of the “extended mind,” which says that the tools we use can become parts of our minds.

**International Conference on Sustainable Cities 2018****Columbia-Fordham-NYU****May 1-2, 2018****Fordham University****Lincoln Center Campus, McNally Amphitheatre****113 West, 60th Street, New York, NY**Creating sustainable cities has become one of the most pressing issues facing the United States and the global community. As Dr. Steven Cohen, Executive Director of the Columbia Earth Institute, has noted, a sustainable city “uses resources as efficiently as possible, uses renewable resources as much as possible, recycles as much as possible and has the least possible impact on the natural environment.” There is a growing consensus, Dr. Cohen argues, that our cities must be “attractive, exciting, healthy and productive places to live, learn, develop, work and play.”

There is, however, far less consensus about how cities can most efficiently and effectively design and implement the architecture and systems to grow and prosper sustainably, as the world’s population urbanizes and the threats to urban areas increase. Rigorous research related to sustainable cities is thus more central than ever, and the questions scholars face are urgent: What is a sustainable city? What is the role of climate change in sustainable cities? And what is the future of the sustainable city—and how can we best get there?

In a unique collaboration to help answer these questions, three universities—Fordham, Columbia and NYU—in the world’s greatest city are organizing a two-day interdisciplinary International Conference on Sustainable Cities. The Conference will bring together leading scholars from a range of disciplines with policymakers, business leaders, and advocates to share insights and set a comprehensive research agenda for this vital subject.

**Keynote Speakers:**- Dr. Steve Cohen, Executive Director of the Columbia Earth Institute
- Nestor Davidson, Albert A. Walsh Chair in Real Estate, Land Use and Property Law at the Fordham Law School
- Dr. Julia Lane, Professor of Public Service at the NYU Wagner Graduate School of Public Service
- Shelley Poticha, Director, Urban Solutions, NRDC-Natural Resources Defense Council
- Jonathan F.P. Rose, Jonathan Rose Companies
