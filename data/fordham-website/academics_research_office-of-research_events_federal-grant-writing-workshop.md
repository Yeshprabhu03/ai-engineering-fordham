**Sponsored by the Fordham Office of Research**

Opening the “Black Box” of Grant Funding*How to Successfully Apply for Federal Grants*

*Presented by:*

**Yuan Liu, Ph.D.**, Neuroscientist, former NIH Office Chief

**Dennis L. Glanzman, Ph.D.**, Neuroscientist, former NIH Program Chief

*Chaired by*

**Rebeca Franco, MPH,**Director of the Office of Sponsored Programs, Fordham University

If you are a newly established investigator, you may have had the following experience:

*You have worked extremely hard for months preparing your first application, nervously submitted it to the funding **agency, anxiously waited many more months, only to receive a notification that your project would not be funded*

The entire process (Application, Review and Funding) may appear to be a mysterious **“Black Box”**

For this grantsmanship workshop, we have invited two former senior program officials from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to reveal the mysteries underlying successful grantsmanship. They have each had more than twenty years of experience at the NIH, where they managed hundreds of active grants in their portfolios, helped thousands of applicants, developed large number of grant funding initiatives, organized and chaired dozens of scientific meetings, designed and presented many grantsmanship and funding opportunity workshops domestically and internationally.

They will share with us the “inside story” of successful grantsmanship, including:

- What are the funding opportunities and various grant mechanisms
- How to find the proper “home” for your project
- How grant applications are reviewed and evaluated
- How funding decisions are made by the Institutes
- The
__Do’s and Don’ts__of preparing and revising applications

The Presenters

**Dr. Yuan Liu** served as Program Director and Office Chief at the NIH for over 20 years. During this time, she served on over a dozen inter-governmental, inter-agency and trans-NIH committees that developed many international and domestic initiatives and programs. She was the co-founder, along with Dr. Glanzman, of the NIH-NSF Collaborative Research of Computational Neuroscience Program, which has funded over 500 projects with over 1000 PIs. This program was recognized by the Presidential Office of Science and Technology Polity as an exemplar of interagency collaboration.

Dr. Liu organized, chaired and presented at numerous scientific symposia and conferences worldwide to promote biomedical research. She also organized and lectured at many Grantsmanship and Career Development workshops in the US, Europe, Asia, and Africa. She published many scientific research papers and review articles, edited three scientific volumes, and continues serving on the editorial board of *Neuroinformatics*. Dr. Liu received her BA and MA from Peking University in China, and her Ph.D. from Universität Basel in Switzerland.

**Dr. Dennis Glanzman** served 30 years in Science Administration at the Federal level, first at the NSF and later at the NIH, managing various grant portfolios in multiple and diverse programs. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of these programs, he was instrumental in forging collaborations between scientists from many different disciplines, including physics, mathematics, statistics, chemistry, engineering, computer science, biology, and psychology.

He gave dozens of Grants-manship and Funding Opportunities presentations, locally, nationally and internationally, and also organized over sixty scientific meetings, conferences and symposia focusing primarily on computational neuroscience. He has published his own grant-supported research articles, edited three research volumes and served on the editorial boards of scientific journals. Dr. Glanzman received his BA (nuclear physics) MS (biological sciences) and PhD (neuroscience) degrees, all from UC Irvine. He was a tenured professor at Arizona State University, and from there he was recruited by the NSF, and later by the NIH, to manage several multi-million-dollar research grant programs.
