Presenters’ Abstracts and Bios

**Keynote Speaker: Dr. J.R. Rao, “The Role of AI in Cybersecurity”**** **

** Abstract**: Today's Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts and cyber threat hunters invest a significant amount of time in investigating alerts to reconstruct and hunt for potential attacks that are underway. The large volume of alerts to be investigated, multiple reports in threat and vulnerability feeds and the lack of any automated support in processing alerts and consolidating threat intelligence makes the task of security practitioners very challenging. In this talk, we discuss how AI can be used at every stage of the threat management lifecycle (detect, investigate, and respond) to help ease the cognitive burden of security practitioners. Specifically, we show how AI can be used (a) to sift through large volumes of events and alerts to identify anomalous behaviors and accurately detect elusive threats, (b) to consolidate threat intelligence from multiple external security sources, and (c) to automatically corroborate findings by

correlating threat kinetics with threat intelligence, thereby demonstrating how AI can be used to provide much-needed support and raise the bar on security.

** ****(In Alphabetical Order)**

**1) Dr. Navid Asgari: “Using LLMs for Strategy and Business Economics Research”**

** Abstract**: I am using LLMs for measurement purposes in three papers. In the first paper, I use OpenAI’s Ada to determine the word embeddings of 310,000 patents of pharmaceutical firms. These word embeddings will be used to measure the textual similarity of the patents and, in turn, the degree of competition among firms. In the second paper, Chat GPT 3.5 is used to interpret scientific papers that report the outcome of clinical trials registered with the National Institute of Health (NIH). Finally, the third paper uses training data influence (TDI) algorithms applied to LLMs to measure organizational knowledge decay.

** Bio:** Navid Asgari, Ph.D., is an associate professor and the Grose Family Endowed Chair at the Strategy Area of the Gabelli School of Business. Dr. Asgari also serves as the associate director of the Global Healthcare Innovation Management Center at Fordham University. In his research, he examines firms’ innovation strategies in the context of the healthcare industry. Some of his teaching courses include “Machine Learning for Strategic Decision Making,” “Innovation and Change Management,” and “Strategy.” As a Fordham-IBM Fellow, he is working on using LLMs to extract information from scientific corpora.

**2) Dr. Nan Jiang, “Generative AI and Multi-Property Drug Discovery Prediction”**

** Abstract**: Various generative AI (GAI) models/platforms such as GCNNs, GANs, DRL, GENTRL, REINVENT, and Torch Drug have been used since 2018 in multi-property drug discovery prediction at industrial scale. However, these existing models often lack robustness and extensibility. In this talk, we focus on Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA) which provides a GAI and multi-property platform for pretraining, generating, evaluating, and optimizing new and diverse models. CFA-optimized generative models show superior performance compared to most of the state-of-the-art individual ADMET-property prediction models on the Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) (

[https://tdcommons.ai/](https://tdcommons.ai/)) leaderboard w.r.t. the 22 ADMET benchmark datasets.

** Bio:** Dr. Nan Jiang is an affiliated member of the Laboratory of Informatics and Data Mining (LIDM) at Fordham University and a quantitative analyst at Obex group LLC. His research interests are in financial and health informatics using computational/statistical methods. In particular, he has focused on the application of AI/ML and model fusion to multi-property optimization, equity ranking, and drug discovery. Nan received his M.S. from Valparaiso University and Ph.D. from Fordham University, both in Economics.


**3) Dr. Aniket Kesari, “Trustworthy AI in Law and Society”**

** Abstract**: What role will the law play in promoting trustworthy AI? Research on “fairness in machine learning” often uses legal definitions to measure bias and fairness. Regulators play an important role in promoting the adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies. Federal, state, and local governments maintain vast troves of data and are among the biggest customers of AI tools. Generative AI promises to transform law and the legal profession, with applications such as making consumer contracts more readable, summarizing court opinions, and even giving legal advice. But AI also comes with risks – entrenching racial biases in credit lending, denying people vital Medicaid benefits, and degrading privacy. How should the law adapt to AI technology, and ensure that AI achieves its promise while avoiding its potential pitfalls?

** Bio:** Dr. Aniket Kesari is an Associate Professor at Fordham Law School. His research focuses on law & technology, data science, and public policy. He uses techniques drawn from causal inference, machine learning, and natural language processing to investigate questions in law & tech, and he is also interested in integrating data science into empirical legal studies more broadly. Some of his recent scholarship covers data breach notification laws, mandatory cybersecurity risk disclosures, privacy and algorithmic fairness, trademark search engines, and online hate speech. In ongoing work, he is conducting computational audiovisual analysis on courtroom videos, using large language models to summarize legal documents, and developing toolkits for effective AI explanations.

**4) Dr. Mohamed Rahouti, “Enhancing AI/ML-based DoS Attack Detection Through Generative AI and Combinatorial Fusion Analysis”**

** Abstract**: Mitigating Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks is vital for online service security and availability. While AI and ML methods have been used for DoS attack detection, new strategies are needed to enhance their performance w. r. t. generalizability and robustness. Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA) combines multiple pre-trained AI/ML models using advanced model fusion algorithms. On the other hand, Generative AI (GAI) models like GANs, VAEs, and GPTs can augment data to its limited or imbalanced list and generate new features to enrich data representation. The union of GAI/CFA would provide a robust and sustainable platform for the DoS mitigation system. This talk will present recent advances in intrusion detection using GAI/CFA synergy.

** Bio:** Dr. Mohamed Rahouti received an M.S. degree in Mathematics (Statistics Concentration) and a Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, both from the University of South Florida (Tampa, FL). He is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer and Information Science at Fordham University in New York City. His research interest focuses on blockchain technology, computer networking, machine learning, and network security with applications to smart cities. Dr. Rahouti has authored/co-authored over 40 peer-reviewed journals/conference papers and is a member of the IEEE Computer and Communications Societies.
