## Conference Summary and Goals

Global developments at the intersection of migration, immigration, and artificial intelligence (AI) raise urgent concerns about fairness, equity, human dignity, and social justice. Immigrant and migrant populations, often among the most vulnerable, face systemic challenges such as limited access to resources, discrimination, exploitation, and ongoing violations of their dignity and security. The rapid integration of AI into decision-making processes presents both opportunities and challenges, highlighting the critical need to address biases, ensure transparency, and promote accountability to prevent AI from perpetuating injustices in employment, healthcare, law enforcement, and other migration-related sectors.

Building on the success of Fordham University’s 2023 International Conference on Social and Environmental Justice, this international conference seeks to examine the connection of migration, immigration, and AI through the lens of social justice and human rights. It aims to foster meaningful dialogue on creating more equitable and humane systems with marginalized communities to protect rights and leverage responsible AI to advance justice for all.

Through keynote speeches, panel discussions, roundtables, and collaborative sessions, participants will explore actionable and sustainable strategies to promote justice, accountability, and participation in policies and technologies impacting marginalized communities. The conference will provide valuable insights and policy recommendations to ensure human rights are prioritized while responsibly harnessing AI to address pressing challenges in migration and immigration.
