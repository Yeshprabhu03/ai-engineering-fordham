### Conference Abstract

Current social, economic, and political systems throughout the world have fostered profound injustice and resulted in unconscionable phenomena such as environmental degradation, racism, ableism, and rising inequality in access to resources and information. Many of these problems are worsening by the day and leading to an increased risk of social and environmental collapse. In response, a substantial body of scholarship and activism has resulted in an attempt to increase social and environmental justice. However, there are rarely efforts to integrate different perspectives on justice issues in a way that can form a foundation for a deep societal shift in mindset and practices.

These ideas motivate our Fordham University 2023 International Conference on Social and Environmental Justice. Through this conference, we plan to listen to a variety of voices that will speak to social and environmental problems and potential solutions. The conference looks to engage academics, intellectuals, social service providers, education leaders, public policy experts, artists, activists, and students alike to imagine a more just and humane landscape. Ultimately, we look to address questions of social and environmental justice in the access to natural and technological resources and knowledge nationally and globally. We also seek to understand how such conditions relate to history, structural adjustment programs, policies worldwide that affect communities and species, and environmental regulations and standards all over the world.
