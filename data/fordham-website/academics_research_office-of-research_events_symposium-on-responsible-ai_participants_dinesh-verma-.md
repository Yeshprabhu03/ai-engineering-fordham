**Bio:**

Dr. Dinesh Verma is working on a protocol (NLIP) jointly with Dr. Mohamed Rahouti of Fordham, which is relevant to responsible AI. The talk will be presented jointly with Dr. Rahouti.

**Abstract:**

The Natural Language Interaction Protocol (NLIP) is an emerging open standard designed to enable secure, interoperable, and multimodal communication between AI-powered agents across diverse platforms and organizations. By defining a common, application-level protocol for natural language exchanges, NLIP aims to reduce fragmentation in AI-enabled services, foster interoperability, and promote equitable access to AI capabilities. Crucially, NLIP embeds security, privacy, and policy transparency features, such as encryption, authentication, regulatory compliance support, and fine-grained context management, into its core specification. These design choices directly address responsible AI principles, ensuring that agent-to-agent communication is safe, auditable, and resistant to misuse while supporting adaptability across modalities, devices, and languages. This talk will outline the motivation, architecture, and deployment models of NLIP, highlight its role in enabling trustworthy AI ecosystems, and discuss open challenges in standardizing responsible, policy-aware natural language interaction at scale.
