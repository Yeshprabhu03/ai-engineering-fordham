# Fordham Science and Justice Consortium Guiding Principles

A top priority of Fordham's strategic plan is to educate for justice. As an institution, we should aim to train future citizens and leaders, commit to having a positive impact on our local and global communities, and serve as an example in fostering justice and equity. We are currently facing a crisis in environmental degradation caused by such factors as pollution, climate change, and habitat destruction, with the effects falling disproportionately on marginalized communities, quality healthcare access is limited for many by racialized and social barriers, and a transient and growing data-centric world is presenting novel forms of inequality in data access and data based discrimination. Science serves as an important framework for providing innovative solutions to promote social and environmental justice. Our initiative is designed to help foster justice-centered research through the science programs at Fordham, and will facilitate active collaboration to produce new research output across current justice issues.

*Guiding Principles: *

- Foster research that supports scientific justice.
- Responsive to the needs of the Bronx community.
- Ensure that community members have an active voice.
- Support changes in curriculum that allows understanding scientific justice and engagement with the Bronx community
