Prof. Vacca’s teaching and research focuses on participatory design and culture. His current work focuses on how participatory design processes can empower marginalized groups and restructure ideas about the importance of diversity and cultural inclusivity in design. He employs a mixed-methods, critical-empirical approach that combines the theories and methodologies of media studies, cultural studies, and human-computer interaction.
