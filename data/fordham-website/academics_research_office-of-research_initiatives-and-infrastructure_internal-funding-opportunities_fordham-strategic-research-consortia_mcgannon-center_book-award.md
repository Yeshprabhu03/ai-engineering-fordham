# Book Award for The McGannon Center

Each year, the McGannon Center awards a book prize to the author(s) of a manuscript that our panel of outside reviewers consider to be the most notable book addressing or informing the social justice, policy, and/or ethical dimensions of communication technology, broadly defined. The Center recognizes the winning entry with a $2,000 prize and invites the winner(s) to give a presentation about the work at Fordham.

Nominations for our annual book award are generally solicited in Fall, and should be book-length research published in the current calendar year, or in late Fall of the prior year (so, submissions for this year’s 2025 Award should be published in 2025 or Fall 2024 and not previously submitted).
