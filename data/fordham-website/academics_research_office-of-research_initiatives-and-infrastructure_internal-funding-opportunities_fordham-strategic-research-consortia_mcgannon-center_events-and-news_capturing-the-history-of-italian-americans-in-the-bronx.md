Join the McGannon Center staff for lunch and a discussion with Jacqueline Reich on the Bronx Italian American History Initiativeon Friday, February 16, 2018.

Founded in 2016, the **Bronx Italian American History Initiative **(BIAHI) is a collaborative oral history research project that studies the history of Italians and Italian Americans in the Bronx in the 20th century.

The BIAHI recovers the personal narratives of Italian and Italian American residents of the Bronx, both past and present, through an archive of catalogued video and audio interviews. Our goal is to document and map the cultural centers in which they settled, lived and worked, and how they interacted with other ethnic and racial groups as their own racial privilege shifted.

**Jacqueline Reich** came to Fordham as a native New Yorker with a diverse academic background: a BA in Romance Languages from Dartmouth, a PhD in Italian from the University of California at Berkeley, and 18 years of teaching film at Stony Brook University. In Fall 2011 she had the honor of being awarded a mid-career fellowship from the Howard Foundation at Brown University.

Her research interests include Film History, Star Studies, Italian Cinema, Italian American Cinema.
