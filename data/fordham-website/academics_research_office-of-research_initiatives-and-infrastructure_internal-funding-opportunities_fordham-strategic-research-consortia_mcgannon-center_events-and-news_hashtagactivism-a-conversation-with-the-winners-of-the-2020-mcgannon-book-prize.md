** About the Program**Last month, the McGannon Center for Communications Studies announced that

*#HashtagActivism*(MIT Press) had won its book prize for a manuscript published in 2020. Our reviewers unanimously felt that the book's rigorous interdisciplinary account of online viral phenomena distinguished it from other book projects in communications research published in the past year. It explains the ways in which networks of black and brown people, women, and other historically subordinated groups have "birthed and nourished" counterpublics on social media. In this way,

*#HashTagActivism*uncovers the lived social impacts of communications technologies in ways that this award means to recognize and celebrate.

On March 2 at 4:00pm, the Center featured the book's authors, [Sarah J.
