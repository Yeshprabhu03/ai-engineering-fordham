![Social Media, Disinformation, and Democracy with Phil Napoli](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/Social-Media,-Disinformation,-and-Democracy-with-Phil-Napoli.png)

**On May 7 at 2 p.m., we will host Phil Napoli of the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University. He will discuss his recent writing, including his excellent and prescient book **).

*Social Media and the Public Interest: Media Regulation in the Disinformation Age*(Columbia 2019

Professor Napoli is a highly regarded expert on media and communications policy in democracy. But, for us at the McGannon Center, he is especially notable because he was a transformational Director of the Center before he left for Rutgers in 2013 on his way to Duke. We are excited to see him again - even if it is over Zoom.

After Professor Napoli presents, Professors [John Carey](https://www.fordham.edu/info/22941/full-time_faculty/4680/john_carey) and [Bozena Mierzejewska](https://www.fordham.edu/info/22941/full-time_faculty/4811/bozena_i_mierzejewska) of the Gabelli School of Business at Fordham will join the conversation. Both have, in different ways, taken up the questions and problems that are at the heart of Professor Napoli's book. Current Center Director [Olivier Sylvain](https://www.fordham.edu/info/23185/olivier_sylvain) will moderate the discussion. The [DeWitt Wallace Center for Media & Democracy](https://dewitt.sanford.duke.edu/) will co-sponsor the event.
