Areas of Research:

Islamic Studies (premodern)

Dr. [Kathryn Kueny](/academics/departments/theology/faculty/kathryn-kueny/) is Professor of Theology at Fordham University, specializing in the area of Islamic Studies. She received her MA and PhD from the University of Chicago, and is the author of two books, The Rhetoric of Sobriety: Wine in Early Islam, and Conceiving Identities: Maternity in Medieval Muslim Discourse and Practice, both published by SUNY Press. Dr. Kueny is working on a new research project, titled Ecologies of Health and Disease: Mapping Somatic Landscapes in a Premodern Islamic Ethics of Care. This work adopts an ethical lens to explore how premodern Muslim societies cultivated therapeutic knowledge in concert with surrounding environments, pious duties, and ethical mandates to translate that knowledge into more tangible forms of care and public welfare.
