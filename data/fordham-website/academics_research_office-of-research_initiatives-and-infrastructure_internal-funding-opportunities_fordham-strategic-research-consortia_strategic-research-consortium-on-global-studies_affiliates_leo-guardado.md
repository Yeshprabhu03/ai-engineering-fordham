Dr. [Leo Guardado](/academics/departments/theology/faculty/leo-guardado/) is from Chalatenango, El Salvador. The civil war forced him and his mother to migrate to Los Angeles, California where he grew up after the age of nine. He has worked ecumenically in the Tucson, Arizona borderlands with churches, dioceses, and NGOs, collaborating strategically across theological and political differences with communities committed to providing a humanitarian and pastoral response to persons in the process of migration. His graduate education was carried out at the University of Notre Dame in an interdisciplinary PhD between the theology department and the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies in the School of Global Affairs. At Fordham he collaborates across departments and disciplines to further develop Fordham’s capacity to engage in accompaniment and research with migrant communities.
