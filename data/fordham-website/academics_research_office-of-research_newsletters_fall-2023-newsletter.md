As we worked on this current online issue of our newsletter, we in the Office of Research continue to be very impressed with the tremendous range of talent and drive of our faculty. Clearly, their research and scholarship inspires and motivates even deeper dives among their students and fellow scholars and researchers in their chosen disciplines. This collective power underscores the vitality and creativity of Fordham as the great research university it is. Here are some of the highlights of our busy past semester.

During this year’s [Research Day](/academics/research/office-of-research/newsletters/fall-2023-newsletter/research-events/),* *we once again presented awards to our Distinguished Research Awardees, and heard from 6 book authors who presented their latest published work. The keynote speaker, Dr. Jeannette Wing, discussed a subject very much on the minds of many of us – “Trustworthy AI.”

The [International Conference on Social and Environmental Justice](/academics/research/office-of-research/newsletters/fall-2023-newsletter/research-events/) held on May 1st and 2nd in our Law School was a great success, as well. Two days with four keynote speakers presenting on related topics, and 10 panels fell under the categories of disability, digital, immigration, and environmental justice. Special thanks to the directors of these four strategic research consortia for their tireless support in organizing this event.

This past semester some very significant personnel changes took place in the Office of Sponsored Programs. We are very excited to have Rebeca Franco join our staff as Director of the OSP. For more details, please see [Staff Updates](/academics/research/office-of-research/newsletters/fall-2023-newsletter/staff-update/). Also, the [OSP External Grants Award Report](/academics/research/office-of-research/newsletters/fall-2023-newsletter/osp-external-grant-awards-report/) for January – June 2023 is available.

Once again, I want to offer a big thank you to all of our faculty, administrators and staff who help foster the wonderful and supportive environment for Fordham’s research enterprise. We are very grateful to you all.

If you have any questions, please contact us.

Wishing you a restorative and healthy summer, and best wishes for a productive fall semester.
