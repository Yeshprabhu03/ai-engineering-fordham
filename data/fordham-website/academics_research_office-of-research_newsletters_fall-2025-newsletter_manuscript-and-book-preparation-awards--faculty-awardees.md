# Manuscript and Book Preparation Awards – Faculty Awardees

The Manuscript and Book Publication Award (MBPA) is designed to assist tenured and tenure-track faculty in publishing books and manuscripts. Applications for the MBPA will only be accepted after the completed manuscript has reached the successful conclusion of the peer review process and has been formally accepted by a publisher. Funding preference will be given to publications submitted to university press publishers.

The MBPA funds may be used for the author’s mandatory contribution to the cost of book and manuscript publication, such as professional indexing, editorial work, digital or interactive content, image and map reproduction, color plates and photos, permissions and cover art.

In Fiscal year 2024-2025, the Office of Research awarded 17 Manuscript and Book awards
