This issue of the OR newsletter is the second fully online edition, and we are very pleased to report on recent events and exciting ones to follow in this current semester.

In the Spring semester, we will hold Research Day 2023, featuring keynote speaker Dr. Jeanette Wing, Executive Vice President for Research, Columbia University. Dr. Wing’s speech is titled “Trustworthy AI.” In addition, Fordham will host the “International Conference on Social and Environmental Justice” at the Fordham School of Law on May 1-2, 2023. Please see details for both under Upcoming Events.

The past semester has been very busy for the Office of Research, and we especially appreciate the lively participation of our Fordham faculty in the events of the past semester. You can navigate to the [Research Events](/academics/research/office-of-research/newsletters/spring-2023-newsletter/research-events/) page for more information on this past Fall semester’s events. We are also pleased to report that 87 Fordham faculty members have been awarded Faculty Fellowships for Academic Year 2023-2024.

The departures from Fordham of our colleagues Kris Wolff and Celinett Rodriguez have placed the Office of Sponsored Programs in an important transitional phase. Searches are underway for both vacant positions. In the meantime, please address any sponsored programs issues to Ms. Beth Torres, Manager, Office of Sponsored Programs, at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4c233f3c0c2a233e28242d2162292839).

Thank you for all your support and your research, which is so central to Fordham’s mission. We look forward to seeing many of you at Research Day in March and the International Conference on Social and Environmental Justice in May.

Wishing you a productive and stimulating Spring 2023 semester.
