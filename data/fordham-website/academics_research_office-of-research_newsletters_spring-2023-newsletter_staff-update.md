# Research Spring 2023 Newsletter Staff Update

## Farewell to Kris Wolff

It is with mixed emotions that I inform you Kris Wolff, Director of the Office of Sponsored Programs, will be leaving Fordham this week. She has accepted a new position as Associate Director of Research Compliance at Columbia University.

Kris has served the Fordham faculty for more than 15 years in the Office of Sponsored Programs. With outstanding competence, great intelligence, and exceptional experience, Kris has provided faculty, staff, and students with extraordinary guidance in securing and managing external funding for their research.

Under her leadership as Director of the Office of Sponsored Program, Fordham has seen an unprecedented increase in many of the measures of the success of faculty sponsored research funding efforts for the University. The number of submitted grant proposals and the total dollars in external funding won by faculty during her time as Director has been remarkable. The support of Kris and her staff to the faculty has undoubtedly facilitated these impressive results, even during the recent challenging years of the global pandemic. I am very grateful for the collegiality, poise, and dedication that Kris has brought to her work. We will miss her very much. Her last day at Fordham was January 20.

A search committee has been formed to conduct a search for Kris’ replacement. In the meantime, please direct any sponsored program issues during this transition period to Ms. Beth Torres, Manager of the Office of Sponsored Programs, at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation for Kris’ contribution to Fordham’s sponsored programs and wish her much success in her future endeavors.
