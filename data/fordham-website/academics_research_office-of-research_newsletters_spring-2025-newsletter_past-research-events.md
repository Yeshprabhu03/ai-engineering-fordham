#### Fordham Faculty visit IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Lab – Oct 11, 2024

IBM hosted a delegation of Fordham faculty and staff this past fall in order to tour their facility and introduce their current and recent past research projects housed there. Some of the talks the delegation heard covered topics such as applications of generative AI in networks and distributed systems, AI ethics and governance, and hybrid cloud research. Artificial Intelligence was a central theme of the day's events. Fordham plans to join IBM and many other organizations in the AI Alliance which would include sharing resources to build a stronger and more robust deployment of AI for alliance members and other organizations.
