### Proposal Preparation Forms

If Fordham is a subawardee on a grant proposal, you may use this form letter to create the Letter of Intent to be included in the application:[Letter of Intent to Enter into a Consortium](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/pdfs/jadu-single-folder-pdfs/Consortium_Letter_of_Intent_Form___Fillable.pdf)

Fordham is a member of the Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) [Expanded Clearinghouse](https://fdpclearinghouse.org/).
