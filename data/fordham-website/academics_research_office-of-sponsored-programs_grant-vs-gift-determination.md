# Grant vs. Gift Determination

## Grant or Gift? How can you tell?

Sometimes it's unclear when you're looking at an award opportunity whether the award, if made, will be a grant handled by the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP), or a gift handled by [Institutional Giving](https://www.fordham.edu/info/26513/corporate_and_foundation_relations) (formerly, Corporate and Foundation Relations) (IG), an arm of Fordham's Development and University Relations (DAUR) area.

Many foundations, for example, use the word "grant" as a catch-all term -- at Fordham, that word has a specific meaning.

We use the Federal guidelines on grants vs. gifts. Below you will find a matrix adapted from those guidelines to help you understand what Fordham means when we say "grant" and "gift". (Note that an award does not have to fulfill 100% of the items on either side; hits on the majority of items under each award category would point us in the direction of determing an award to be in that category.)
