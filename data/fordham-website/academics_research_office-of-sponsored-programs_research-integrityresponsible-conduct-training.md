# Research Integrity/Responsible Conduct Training

As defined by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), research integrity is "the use of honest and verifiable methods in proposing, performing, and evaluating research and reporting research results with particular attention to adherence to rules, regulations, guidelines, and commonly accepted professional codes or norms." Conducting research with integrity will keep an institution safe from the specter of scientific misconduct.

One of the ways that researchers at Fordham can help maintain integrity is through training in the Responsible Conduct of Research (you might also think of it as training in ethics). We've gathered information about formal classroom training as well as online resources that are available to Fordham researchers.

The U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) has issued a regulation on the handling of misconduct in science. All institutions that accept funding from the PHS (which includes the NIH) must comply with these regulations.

Guided by the model policy of the Office of Research Integrity, Fordham has its own Policy for Responding to Allegations of Scientific Misconduct. Please use the link to the left to review our policy.
