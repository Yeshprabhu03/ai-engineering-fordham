# Public Health Service Regulation

## Subpart A--General

[Final rule: June 16, 2005]

**§ 93.100 General policy.**

- Research misconduct involving PHS support is contrary to the interests of the PHS and the Federal government and to the health and safety of the public, to the integrity of research, and to the conservation of public funds.
- The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and institutions that apply for or receive Public Health Service (PHS) support for biomedical or behavioral research, biomedical or behavioral research training, or activities related to that research or research training share responsibility for the integrity of the research process. HHS has ultimate oversight authority for PHS supported research, and for taking other actions as appropriate or necessary, including the right to assess allegations and perform inquiries or investigations at any time. Institutions and institutional members have an affirmative duty to protect PHS funds from misuse by ensuring the integrity of all PHS supported work, and primary responsibility for responding to and reporting allegations of research misconduct, as provided in this part.

**§ 93.101 Purpose.**

The purpose of this part is to--

- Establish the responsibilities of HHS, PHS, the Office of Research Integrity (ORI), and institutions in responding to research misconduct issues
- Define what constitutes misconduct in PHS supported research
- Define the general types of administrative actions HHS and the PHS may take in response to research misconduct and
- Require institutions to develop and implement policies and procedures for--
- Reporting and responding to allegations of research misconduct covered by this part
- Providing HHS with the assurances necessary to permit the institutions to participate in PHS supported research.
- Protect the health and safety of the public, promote the integrity of PHS supported research and the research process, and conserve public funds.

**§ 93.102 Applicability.**

- Each institution that applies for or receives PHS support for biomedical or behavioral research, research training or activities related to that research or research training must comply with this part.
- This part applies to allegations of research misconduct and research misconduct involving:
- Applications or proposals for PHS support for biomedical or behavioral extramural or intramural research, research training or activities related to that research or research training, such as the operation of tissue and data banks and the dissemination of research information
- PHS supported biomedical or behavioral extramural or intramural research
- PHS supported biomedical or behavioral extramural or intramural research training programs
- PHS supported extramural or intramural activities that are related to biomedical or behavioral research or research training, such as the operation of tissue and data banks or the dissemination of research information and
- Plagiarism of research records produced in the course of PHS supported research, research training or activities related to that research or research training.
- This includes any research proposed, performed, reviewed, or reported, or any research record generated from that research, regardless of whether an application or proposal for PHS funds resulted in a grant, contract, cooperative agreement, or other form of PHS support.
- This part does not supersede or establish an alternative to any existing regulations or procedures for handling fiscal improprieties, the ethical treatment of human or animal subjects, criminal matters, personnel actions against Federal employees, or actions taken under the HHS debarment and suspension regulations at 45 CFR part 76 and 48 CFR subparts 9.4 and 309.4.
- This part does not prohibit or otherwise limit how institutions handle allegations of misconduct that do not fall within this part's definition of research misconduct or that do not involve PHS support.

**§ 93.103 Research misconduct.**

Research misconduct means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results.

- Fabrication is making up data or results and recording or reporting them.
- Falsification is manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record.
- Plagiarism is the appropriation of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit.
- Research misconduct does not include honest error or differences of opinion.

**§ 93.104 Requirements for findings of research misconduct.**

A finding of research misconduct made under this part requires that--

- There be a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant research community and
- The misconduct be committed intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly and
- The allegation be proven by a preponderance of the evidence.

**§ 93.105 Time limitations.**

- Six-year limitation. This part applies only to research misconduct occurring within six years of the date HHS or an institution receives an allegation of research misconduct.
- Exceptions to the six-year limitation. Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply in the following instances:
- Subsequent use exception. The respondent continues or renews any incident of alleged research misconduct that occurred before the six-year limitation through the citation, republication or other use for the potential benefit of the respondent of the research record that is alleged to have been fabricated, falsified, or plagiarized.
- Health or safety of the public exception. If ORI or the institution, following consultation with ORI, determines that the alleged misconduct, if it occurred, would possibly have a substantial adverse effect on the health or safety of the public.
- "Grandfather'' exception. If HHS or an institution received the allegation of research misconduct before the effective date of this part.

**§ 93.106 Evidentiary standards.**

The following evidentiary standards apply to findings made under this part.

- Standard of proof. An institutional or HHS finding of research misconduct must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence.
- Burden of proof.
- The institution or HHS has the burden of proof for making a finding of research misconduct. The destruction, absence of, or respondent's failure to provide research records adequately documenting the questioned research is evidence of research misconduct where the institution or HHS establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the respondent intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly had research records and destroyed them, had the opportunity to maintain the records but did not do so, or maintained the records and failed to produce them in a timely manner and that the respondent's conduct constitutes a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant research community.
- The respondent has the burden of going forward with and the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, any and all affirmative defenses raised. In determining whether HHS or the institution has carried the burden of proof imposed by this part, the finder of fact shall give due consideration to admissible, credible evidence of honest error or difference of opinion presented by the respondent.
- The respondent has the burden of going forward with and proving by a preponderance of the evidence any mitigating factors that are relevant to a decision to impose administrative actions following a research misconduct proceeding.

**§ 93.107 Rule of interpretation.**

Any interpretation of this part must further the policy and purpose of the HHS and the Federal government to protect the health and safety of the public, to promote the integrity of research, and to conserve public funds.

**§ 93.108 Confidentiality.**

- Disclosure of the identity of respondents and complainants in research misconduct proceedings is limited, to the extent possible, to those who need to know, consistent with a thorough, competent, objective and fair research misconduct proceeding, and as allowed by law. Provided, however, that:
- The institution must disclose the identity of respondents and complainants to ORI pursuant to an ORI review of research misconduct proceedings under § 93.403.
- Under § 93.517(g), HHS administrative hearings must be open to the public.
- Except as may otherwise be prescribed by applicable law, confidentiality must be maintained for any records or evidence from which research subjects might be identified. Disclosure is limited to those who have a need to know to carry out a research misconduct proceeding.

**§ 93.109 Coordination with other agencies.**

- When more than one agency of the Federal government has jurisdiction of the subject misconduct allegation, HHS will cooperate in designating a lead agency to coordinate the response of the agencies to the allegation. Where HHS is not the lead agency, it may, in consultation with the lead agency, take appropriate action to protect the health and safety of the public, promote the integrity of the PHS supported research and research process and conserve public funds.
- In cases involving more than one agency, HHS may refer to evidence or reports developed by that agency if HHS determines that the evidence or reports will assist in resolving HHS issues. In appropriate cases, HHS will seek to resolve allegations jointly with the other agency or agencies.

- While not required by this part, if the institution's procedures provide for an appeal by the respondent that could result in a reversal or modification of the findings of research misconduct in the investigation report, the institution must complete any such appeal within 120 days of its filing. Appeals from personnel or similar actions that would not result in a reversal or modification of the findings of research misconduct are excluded from the 120-day limit.
- If unable to complete any appeals within 120 days, the institution must ask ORI for an extension in writing and provide an explanation for the request.
- ORI may grant requests for extension for good cause. If ORI grants an extension, it may direct the institution to file periodic progress reports.

**§ 93.315 Notice to ORI of institutional findings and actions.**

The institution must give ORI the following:

- Investigation Report. Include a copy of the report, all attachments, and any appeals.
- Final institutional action. State whether the institution found research misconduct, and if so, who committed the misconduct.
- Findings. State whether the institution accepts the investigation's findings.
- Institutional administrative actions. Describe any pending or completed administrative actions against the respondent.

**§ 93.316 Completing the research misconduct process.**

- ORI expects institutions to carry inquiries and investigations through to completion and to pursue diligently all significant issues. An institution must notify ORI in advance if the institution plans to close a case at the inquiry, investigation, or appeal stage on the basis that the respondent has admitted guilt, a settlement with the respondent has been reached, or for any other reason, except the closing of a case at the inquiry stage on the basis that an investigation is not warranted or a finding of no misconduct at the investigation stage, which must be reported to ORI under § 93.315.
- After consulting with the institution on its basis for closing a case under paragraph (a) of this section, ORI may conduct an oversight review of the institution's handling of the case and take appropriate action including:
- Approving or conditionally approving closure of the case
- Directing the institution to complete its process
- Referring the matter for further investigation by HHS or,
- Taking a compliance action.

### Other Institutional Responsibilities

**§ 93.317 Retention and custody of the research misconduct proceeding record.**

- Definition of records of research misconduct proceedings. As used in this section, the term "records of research misconduct proceedings" includes:
- The records that the institution secures for the proceeding pursuant to §§ 93.305, 93.307(b) and 93.310(d), except to the extent the institution subsequently determines and documents that those records are not relevant to the proceeding or that the records duplicate other records that are being retained
- The documentation of the determination of irrelevant or duplicate records
- The inquiry report and final documents (not drafts) produced in the course of preparing that report, including the documentation of any decision not to investigate as required by § 93.309(d)
- The investigation report and all records (other than drafts of the report) in support of that report, including the recordings or transcriptions of each interview conducted pursuant to § 93.310(g) and
- The complete record of any institutional appeal covered by § 93.314.

- Maintenance of record. Unless custody has been transferred to HHS under paragraph (c) of this section, or ORI has advised the institution in writing that it no longer needs to retain the records, an institution must maintain records of research misconduct proceedings in a secure manner for 7 years after completion of the proceeding or the completion of any PHS proceeding involving the research misconduct allegation under subparts D and E of this part, whichever is later.
- Provision for HHS custody. On request, institutions must transfer custody of or provide copies to HHS, of any institutional record relevant to a research misconduct allegation covered by this part, including the research records and evidence, to perform forensic or other analyses or as otherwise needed to conduct an HHS inquiry or investigation or for ORI to conduct its review or to present evidence in any proceeding under subparts D and E of this part.

**§ 93.318 Notifying ORI of special circumstances.**

At any time during a research misconduct proceeding, as defined in § 93.223, an institution must notify ORI immediately if it has reason to believe that any of the following conditions exist:

- Health or safety of the public is at risk, including an immediate need to protect human or animal subjects.
- HHS resources or interests are threatened.
- Research activities should be suspended.
- There is reasonable indication of possible violations of civil or criminal law.
- Federal action is required to protect the interests of those involved in the research misconduct proceeding.
- The research institution believes the research misconduct proceeding may be made public prematurely so that HHS may take appropriate steps to safeguard evidence and protect the rights of those involved.
- The research community or public should be informed.

**§ 93.319 Institutional standards.**

- Institutions may have internal standards of conduct different from the HHS standards for research misconduct under this part. Therefore, an institution may find conduct to be actionable under its standards even if the action does not meet this part's definition of research misconduct.
- An HHS finding or settlement does not affect institutional findings or administrative actions based on an institution's internal standards of conduct.

### Subpart D--Responsibilities of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services

General Information

**§ 93.400 General statement of ORI authority.**

### Research Misconduct Issues

**§ 93.402 ORI allegation assessments.**

- When ORI receives an allegation of research misconduct directly or becomes aware of an allegation or apparent instance of research misconduct, it may conduct an initial assessment or refer the matter to the relevant institution for an assessment, inquiry, or other appropriate actions.
- If ORI conducts an assessment, it considers whether the allegation of research misconduct appears to fall within the definition of research misconduct, appears to involve PHS supported biomedical or behavior research, research training or activities related to that research or research training, as provided in § 93.102, and whether it is sufficiently specific so that potential evidence may be identified and sufficiently substantive to warrant an inquiry. ORI may review all readily accessible, relevant information related to the allegation.
- If ORI decides that an inquiry is warranted, it forwards the matter to the appropriate institution or HHS component.
- If ORI decides that an inquiry is not warranted it will close the case and forward the allegation in accordance with paragraph(e) of this section.
- ORI may forward allegations that do not fall within the jurisdiction of this part to the appropriate HHS component, Federal or State agency, institution, or other appropriate entity.

**§ 93.403 ORI review of research misconduct proceedings.**

ORI may conduct reviews of research misconduct proceedings. In conducting its review, ORI may--

- Recommends that HHS seek to settle the case.

**§ 93.405 Notifying the respondent of findings of research misconduct and HHS administrative actions.**

- When the ORI makes a finding of research misconduct or seeks to impose or enforce HHS administrative actions, other than debarment or suspension, it notifies the respondent in a charge letter. In cases involving a debarment or suspension action, the HHS debarring official issues a notice of proposed debarment or suspension to the respondent as part of the charge letter. The charge letter includes the ORI findings of research misconduct and the basis for them and any HHS administrative actions. The letter also advises the respondent of the opportunity to contest the findings and administrative actions under Subpart E of this part.
- The ORI sends the charge letter by certified mail or a private delivery service to the last known address of the respondent or the last known principal place of business of the respondent's attorney.

**§ 93.406 Final HHS actions.**

Unless the respondent contests the charge letter within the 30-day period prescribed in § 93.501, the ORI finding of research misconduct is the final HHS action on the research misconduct issues and the HHS administrative actions become final and will be implemented, except that the debarring official's decision is the final HHS action on any debarment or suspension actions.

**§ 93.407 HHS administrative actions.**

- In response to a research misconduct proceeding, HHS may impose HHS administrative actions that include but are not limited to:
- Clarification, correction, or retraction of the research record.
- Letters of reprimand.
- Imposition of special certification or assurance requirements to ensure compliance with applicable regulations or terms of PHS grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements.
- Suspension or termination of a PHS grant, contract, or cooperative agreement.

- Any authorized HHS component may impose, administer, or enforce HHS administrative actions separately or in coordination with other HHS components, including, but not limited to ORI, the Office of Inspector General, the PHS funding component, and the debarring official.

**§ 93.408 Mitigating and aggravating factors in HHS administrative actions.**

The purpose of HHS administrative actions is remedial. The appropriate administrative action is commensurate with the seriousness of the misconduct, and the need to protect the health and safety of the public, promote the integrity of the PHS supported research and research process, and conserve public funds. HHS considers aggravating and mitigating factors in determining appropriate HHS administrative actions and their terms. HHS may consider other factors as appropriate in each case. The existence or nonexistence of any factor is not determinative:
