[Fordham University External Award Manual](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/office-of-sponsored-programs/pdfs/Fordham-External-Award-Manual-(6.15.2023)-.pdf)is an ever-evolving document that is updated periodically based on policy changes/creations, laws, and feedback from you. It contains a post-award contacts list as Appendix H which you may find especially helpful.

### Grants Training

The Offices of Sponsored Programs and Institutional Giving provide ad hoc training workshops during the year -- please keep an eye out for emails.

For formalized training on grant proposal development, you may take the CITI Training program "Essentials of Grant Proposal Development" which is available to all members of the Fordham community. This program has a quiz, which is used for Continuing Education credits. You may elect not to take the quiz if you'd like. General information on registering for CITI Training and adding courses can be [found here](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/pdfs/jadu-single-folder-pdfs/Instructions_for_Completing_Human_Subjects_Research_CITI_Training_UPDATED_2.28.17.pdf).
