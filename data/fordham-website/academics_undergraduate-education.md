# Undergraduate Education

[Campuses](/about/campuses/)

Each of our campuses has its own distinct personality, but each is also distinctly Fordham, the Jesuit University of New York, fueled by a unique spirit of passionate engagement.

Here, your education and your experiences outside the classroom will inform each other.

- Both our
[Lincoln Center campus](/about/campuses/lincoln-center-campus/)in the heart of**Manhattan**and our green and Gothic[Rose Hill campus](/about/campuses/rose-hill-campus/)in the**Bronx**give you the opportunity to live and study in an exciting environment, with all the opportunities of New York City at your fingertips. [Commuters](/student-life/commuter-student-services/)and[residents](/student-life/living-on-campus/)are both welcome and integral parts of each campus, helping to make it a unique and diverse community that helps every member broaden their perspective.

[Undergraduate Colleges and Schools](/academics/colleges-and-schools/undergraduate-schools/)

As an undergraduate student, you can choose from three undergraduate colleges across two New York City campuses, with all the resources and benefits of one research university.

- We have two liberal arts and sciences colleges—
[Fordham College at Lincoln Center](/fordham-college-at-lincoln-center/)and[Fordham College at Rose Hill](/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/)—one at each campus. - The
[Gabelli School of Business](/gabelli-school-of-business/)also has undergraduate programs on both the Rose Hill and Lincoln Center campuses, though the business majors offered are different at each campus. - Adult learners can learn more about the
[School of Professional and Continuing Studies](/school-of-professional-and-continuing-studies/).

[Core Curriculum](/academics/undergraduate-education/core-curriculum/)

At all three of our undergraduate colleges, the core curriculum is the foundation.

These liberal arts and sciences courses help you explore your passions, discover new interests, and broaden your perspective. You’ll also gain important skills you can take into any job, learning to synthesize information, articulate your point, make logical decisions, and adapt to an evolving world.

The Gabelli School of Business has an additional business core, which immerses you in every business discipline and gives you a strong grounding across accounting, finance, information technology, marketing, operations, and more.
