# Serving the City Internships

Fulfilling Fordham’s promise that New York is our campus, the Serving the City Internship Program provides Fordham College Rose Hill and Fordham College Lincoln Center students with access to paid internships with nonprofit organizations aligned with Fordham’s mission.

Through these internships, students gain valuable professional experience, broaden their networks, and put Fordham’s Jesuit mission into action by partnering with our local community in educational, cultural, anti-racist, or social justice-related endeavors.

## Advancing the Work of Nonprofits

Established during COVID to create remote internship opportunities for our students as well as bolster the city's arts and cultural organizations hard hit by pandemic closures, t**oday, Serving the City arranges paid internships with a growing number of institutions in the areas of arts and culture but also health, education, and social justice, advancing their missions while providing Fordham students with invaluable experiences.**

## Support Us

Serving the City internships are made possible by Fordham donors. The generosity of Fordham alumni allows us to offer stipends to students during these internships, making them a viable alternative to part-time employment that may not afford them the same relevant professional experience.

We have placed 150 students in internships.


We welcome you to consider a gift of any amount to help us continue to expand these opportunities for Fordham College at Rose Hill and Fordham College at Lincoln Center students.
