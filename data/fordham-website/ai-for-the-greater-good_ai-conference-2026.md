# Ignatian AI Conference

**October 1 - 3, 2026**

**Fordham University, New York**

**Lincoln Center Campus**

How can we explore the use and development of AI through a Jesuit lens? Our conference will bring together an international team of Jesuit scholars, AI experts, and industry professionals to explore answers to this question. Together, we hope to produce a framework that will aid reflection at Jesuit schools and institutions around the world.
