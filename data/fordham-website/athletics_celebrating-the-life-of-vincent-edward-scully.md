## Remembering Vin Scully

A Bronx native, Scully graduated from Fordham Preparatory School and served briefly in the U.S. Navy before enrolling at Fordham College at Rose Hill. He first learned the broadcasting trade at WFUV, the Fordham public media station founded during his undergraduate years. Faith was the bedrock of Vin Scully’s life. According to his family, “He never missed an opportunity to owe every blessing and success to the Grace of God.”
