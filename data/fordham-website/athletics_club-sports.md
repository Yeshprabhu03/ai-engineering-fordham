Fordham University's Department of Recreation aims to provide all students with the opportunity to pursue their interests in an athletic and competitive capacity through their Club and Intramural sport programs. We strive to offer a wide array of opportunities to keep our diverse student body engaged, while continually making new programs which promote an active and fun lifestyle for all students.

Goals of the Club Sports Program

- To develop and maintain mutually supportive programs of excellence in both academics and athletics in order to benefit the students, faculty, administrators, and alumni of Fordham University.
- To provide recreational opportunities for the students to fulfill their college needs.
- To employ coaches and other administrative staff members who are capable of performing as professionals in an educational community where high standards of integrity and ethical behavior, as well as sportsmanship, are expected of its members.
- To operate club sports programs at a high level of competition and to seek affiliation with institutions which demonstrate a similar commitment to academic excellence, institutional integrity, and athletic competitiveness.
- To promote character development in student-athletes, including cooperation, teamwork, leadership, and loyalty.
- To train student-athletes in legitimate means of displaying good sportsmanship and the will to win, thereby contributing to the development of institutional morale, loyalty, and school spirit.
