# Club Hockey

September 2025 - The 2025-26 season sees the Fordham University ice hockey program now entering its 55th campaign, one of the longest of any of the clubs at school. The team was created in the 1967-68 season playing and winning one game versus cross-town rival Manhattan College. The "Maroon Six" as they were known then, began playing a full slate of games during the 1970-71 season. The team joined the MIHL (Metropolitan Intercollegiate Hockey League), in the fall of 1970 and began playing such teams as Columbia, Fairfield and St. Johns. The team was originally created and funded by Fordham University athletics to become a varsity program. However, the team was relegated to its current club status in 1975 when the school chose to elevate its club football team back to varsity instead. After a league name change to the BSMIHL (Bi-State Metropolitan Intercollegiate Hockey League) for the 1975-76 season, the team held the longest tenure as a member of the MCHC (Metropolitan Collegiate Hockey Conference) (43 seasons) after the league changed its name at the start the of the 1976-77 season. During their time in the MCHC, the team captured 5 league championships.

The team is coached by Pete Genesi, who begins his 5th year with the team. Under Coach Genesi’s tenure, the team has qualified for three appearances in the AAU National Tournament. A USA Hockey Certified Level 5 Coach, he has 20 years of coaching experience, coaching at every level from ages 4 to 24.

The team's two assistant coaches returning this year are Dave Smith (11th year) and former Team Captain Anthony Demario (Gabelli ’23). Along with Genesi, they have been a big part of the reason why Fordham has such a well-rounded, experienced, and successful coaching staff.

Behind the scenes is Director of Hockey Operations, Andrew Mola CBA '86 (41st year) who handles the day-to-day team operations which can range from organizing transportation, finances, alumni relations, statistical analysis, scheduling, recruiting, and running game day operations. Mola also is in his 17th year serving as the President of the MCHC and has held prior MCHC Executive Board positions such as Director of Eligibility and Director of Structures.

Another person behind the scenes is our Webmaster and Social Media Lead, Michael Casserly CBA '99, GBA '05 (20th year). Mike is responsible for the operation and maintenance of our official team website fordhamramshockey.com, as well as maintaining the content for the hockey team pages on the Fordham University website fordham.edu.
