# Club Men's Lacrosse

Welcome to the Fordham University Men’s Club Lacrosse page. Founded in 1970, the Fordham Men’s Club Lacrosse program has been a proud part of the university’s club sports community for decades. Our team is made up of dedicated and driven student-athletes who share a passion for the game and a commitment to excellence both on and off the field.

We compete in the National College Lacrosse League (NCLL), facing programs across the tri-state area in a competitive and rewarding environment that values teamwork, discipline, and sportsmanship. Beyond athletics, our program emphasizes academic success and professional development, supported by strong mentorship from upperclassmen and alumni.

The Rams hold practices twice a week and play home games under the lights at historic Murphy Field, overlooking the New York Botanical Garden.
