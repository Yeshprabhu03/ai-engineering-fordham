# Men's Club Rugby Giving Tuesday

Dear Friends and Family,

The love and support from each of you has been nothing short of amazing. You are a vital part of our incredible Ramily!

As we continue to grow, we rely on the generosity of our supporters to help us achieve even more. This **Giving Tuesday **help us reach our goal of $15,000 to support the cost of our upcoming 7s and 15s season.

Every contribution—big or small—makes a difference, and we are grateful for whatever you can give. If you’re able, please consider making a donation today to help us reach our goal and continue building the strength and spirit of our Ramily.
