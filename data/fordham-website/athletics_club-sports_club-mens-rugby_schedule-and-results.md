### Match Reports:

3/8/14 (Columbia): Fordham Rugby fell to cross-town rival Columbia 22-15 on a downright balmy Saturday evening at Rose Hill. The Rams 1st XV (0-1) could not get in-sync offensively and could not cover the loss of leading point-scorer Rusty Gough, who sat out due to injury. FURFC's 2nd XV moved to 2-0 on the spring with a 26-18 victory over the Lions. Solid pace and energy through out saw the Rams wear down Columbia.

4/13/14 (Hofstra): This past weekend, Fordham Rugby hosted Hofstra for two matches at beautiful Rose Hill in the Bronx. FURFC's A-side (1-1-1) earned a 17-5 victory, paced by strong defense and Senior Fly Half Jack Kelleher's two tries. The "Killer B's" of FURFC'S 2nd XV, in a condensed match, earned a 7-0 victory and moved to 4-0 on the season.

4/19/14 (SUNY Albany): On Holy Saturday, Fordham Rugby defeated the Albany Great Danes 49-0 in an outstanding offensive and defensive performance. Playing in his final game for Fordham, Senior Captain Jack Kelleher opened up the scoring with a try, and the Rams (2-1-1) never looked back.

**FURFC versus SUNY Stony Brook: Home Loss 33-20**After going down 10-3 in the first half, the Rams used steady forward ball and mauls to pressure the Stony Brook defense. A great drive and maul off a lineout saw the Rams earn a try and take the lead around the 60th minute of the match. However, Stony Brook played an intelligent territory game and uneven defense by the Rams at the end of the match cost Fordham in the end. Stony Brook came out on top 33-20. FURFC's Second XV won its opening match by a final of 19-7. Excellent running and defense by Elias Gelpi and Dan Perrino should see them knocking on the door for First XV time soon.

**FURFC versus SUNY Binghamton: Away Victory 24-7**FURFC defeated Binghamton 24-7 to earn its first Empire Rugby Conference win. The Rams were led on attack by Sophomore #12 Jace Caufield, who paced the offense with 4 runs of over 20 meters and 2 tries. The Rams' Second XV came out swinging as well, earning a 38-0 victory. Athlete Dan Perrino led the way with strong defense and 3 tries. If he was knocking on the door for First XV time last week, he is standing on the threshold now.

**FURFC versus West Point**The Rams dropped their Empire season opener to a mixed West Point A/B side 40-5. The Rams held their own through the first 60 minutes, trailing 13-5 before a fitness deficit allowed West Point to wrap up the competition. Nevertheless, during the first 60 minutes, Fordham played strong efficient defense and had moments of brilliance on offense. The defensive play of the forwards around the rucks was supported by quality kicking from the Fordham backline. This performance matched closely the Northeast Rugby Union playoff match between West Point and Fordham when Fordham held the USMA at 10-5 for the first 60 minutes.

**FURFC versus Binghamton**Fordham dropped a hard fought nail-biter 8-7 to Binghamton on Sunday at Rose Hill. The Rams showed staunch defense, but will need to continue work on their attack structure. The Rams earned a bonus point for the close loss.

### Match Reports

**FURFC versus SUNY Stony Brook: Away Loss 36-0**A young, but scrappy Fordham side fell 36-0 on Friday Night to #23 ranked Stony Brook. Fordham was able to move the ball well through their initial phases, but could not break through on the fourth and fifth phase ball. Three intercept tries led to a successful night for the Seawolves.

**FURFC versus USMMA Kings Point: Away Loss 41-3**Fordham lost to King's Point 41-3 on Friday night in Great Neck. The Rams played the beginning of the match on the front foot, dominating territory in the first half. Unfortunately for the Rams, the Midshipmen's defense was up to the task. Despite the dominance in territory, the Rams were down at the half 17-3. The Rams opened the second half with some sloppy passing, costing them two tries. The Midshipmen piled on the points and were the more aggressive team in the end.

**FURFC versus Iona College: Away Loss 27-5****FURFC versus SUNY Stony Brook: Home Loss 27-5**Fordham fell to the Stony Brook Seawolves 27-5 on Friday night. Flat play and difficulties with the 9/10 exchange were problems through out. The lone bright spot for the Rams was their efforts in the scrum. The Rams won three of the Seawolves put-ins and popped up the opposing front row several times.

**FURFC versus USMMA at King's Point: Home Loss 34-26 (50th Anniversary Match)**The Fordham Ruggers fell to Kings Point 34-26 at rain-soaked Coffey Stadium. The Rams, playing under the bright lights of Coffey for the first time in their history, allowed 12 unanswered points in the first 10 minutes of play. After settling in, the Rams scored 2 overload tries to even the match at 12-12 at the end of the first half.

The second half, however, started out much like the first: the Rams played on the back foot and attempted to kick for territory instead of possession. Kings Point put on a solid offensive display to begin the second half. Despite a desperate, heart-filled rally, Fordham ran out of opportunities and time, falling 34-26 before the home crowd.

**FURFC versus Columbia University: Home Victory 50-8 (9/11 Memorial Match)**Fordham Rugby defeated its old rival, Columbia, on Sunday, September 11th, 50-8 at an emotional Murphy Field. Fordham University held a pre-game memorial ceremony featuring the Fordham ROTC Color Guard. Ram's Captain Nick Braun read the names of the fallen Fordham Ruggers and a moment of silence was held before the Ramblers sang the National Anthem. As for the match, #9 Jard Rozowsky slotted 15 points across 6 conversations and 1 penalty try. Center AJ Falco led all try scorers with 2 tries on two powerful break away runs.

Special Thanks to Dan Somma for attending the match, to Club Sports Director Mike Roberts who helped us secure the loud speaker systems, and to Father Tueth who gave a beautiful prayer before kickoff.

The Rams played loose but aggressive, capitalizing early with several strong runs from Centers Luke Shasha and Keith Reid. It was a full team effort and a great way to build momentum heading into next weekend's Beast of the East tournament in Rhode Island. Jared Rozowsky contributed 13 points on 1 penalty and 5 conversions.

**FURFC versus Albany: Home Victory 18-15**Fordham defeated the University of Albany 18-15 on its home turf at Murphy Field. Trailing at the half by 12-7 to a tough Albany side, the injury-depleted Rams settled in, effectively integrating their forward to gain territory. Number 9, Jared Rozowsky was man of the match, scoring 8 points through one conversion and two key penalty kicks from over 25 meters out. Those kicks put the Rams up for good in the second half.

**FURFC versus Columbia: Away Victory 19-12**Fordham defeated Columbia on Friday night, 19-12, in its first spring match. It was a very well contested match, and a strong opening to the team's spring campaign. Fordham's pack dominated in the scrums all night, and after going down 12-0 in the first half, the Rams dictated the pace of the game in the second half with 19 unanswered points. Try scorers were #13 Keith Reid, #11 Alex Kipel, and #15 Co-Captain Seth Houston, who scored the final try of the match with not time left on the clock.
