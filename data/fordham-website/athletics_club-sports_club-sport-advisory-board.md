# Club Sport Advisory Board

## 2022-2023 Club Sport Advisory Board



## Abbie Hobika - Club Squash


My name is Abbie Hobika and I am the president of the women's club squash team here at Fordham University. I am super excited to be a part of the Club sports advisory board this year and hope to balance it with my other clubs, including Rose Hill Society and Smart Woman Securities. I am a current senior pursuing a bachelor's degree with majors in Spanish and Philosophy, and a minor in Bioethics. And although I am super sad to graduate from Fordham this upcoming May, I am looking forward to applying to law schools in the New York area for the coming years.


## Bryce Vitale - Club Hockey


I am the president of the Club Ice Hockey team here at Fordham University. I am currently a sophomore and I am planning on majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Business Administration. Over the years, I practically grew up in a hockey rink, and I have been actively involved in competitive sports ever since. Hockey has been one of my main passions since the age of 2 and I have been lucky enough to continue my career at the collegiate level. Aside from my involvement in Fordham Hockey, I perform in the Jazz Ensemble and I am involved in the Residence Halls Association on the Rose Hill Campus, where I was recently elected as president of O'Hare. A fun fact about me is that I play the piano and sing! I am excited for the upcoming years at Fordham and most importantly excited to be a part of the Club Sports Advisory Board.
