# Club Volleyball

**About Club Volleyball:**

Fordham Club Volleyball is an established athletic club at Fordham University and consists of both a Men’s team and a Women’s team, which compete in the ECVA and NWVCL, respectively. The club consists of motivated, passionate individuals who are committed to self-improvement and building a positive community around themselves both on and off the court. The club emphasizes the promotion of a safe space for growth and continued instruction for volleyball throughout college.

**History:**

Fordham Club Volleyball was proposed in the Fall of 2021 by David Moran and Ariadna Wong. This proposal was later accepted in the Summer of 2022, and the club was established on campus prospectively, holding practices twice a week. After an academic year as a prospective team, Club Volleyball became an official Fordham Club Sport in the Fall of 2023, where they became members of the ECVA and NWVCL leagues.


The Club Volleyball team holds practices in the Lombardi Field House on the Fordham campus and travels to tournaments within its leagues.
