# Club Women's Soccer

The Women's Club Soccer team was created in the Fall of 2010 and has rapidly grown in the last several years. The team was established to provide an opportunity for those interested in playing soccer competitively in a more relaxed environment.

## Historical Performance

Women's Club Soccer has been extremely successful in the past few years. They have been champions of the Metro New York/New Jersey League every season since 2014, appeared at regionals each of these years, and were national semi-finalists in 2014. They pride themselves on being one of the top club teams in the Tri-State area!

## Prospective Athletes

Women's Club Soccer holds tryouts every August in preparation for the Fall season, and the team is always looking for new talent to add to the roster. This program is an excellent opportunity to continue playing soccer at a competitive level without the same pressures and requirements of a varsity team, meet new people, and stay in shape.
