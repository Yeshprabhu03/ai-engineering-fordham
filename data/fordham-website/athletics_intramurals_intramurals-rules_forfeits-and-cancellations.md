# Forfeits and Cancellations

## Intramural Sports Forfeit and Cancellation Policy

-
Teams are given a 5 minute grace period to begin their game. After that time, the Intramural Sports Supervisor will declare a forfiet towards any team that does not have the minimum number of players required to begin a game, any team that does not show up or any team that is not ready to begin a game. Teams who do not have the minimum number of players to play in the game will have five minutes to have enough players to field a team. Teams who attempt to cancel their game less than 24 business hours in advance of their game may be issued a forfeit for their game rather than a cancellation. The Intrmaural Sports program does not reschedule any games that teams forfeit. Teams are given a -2 rating if they forfeit a game. If a team reaches -3 points at any point in the semester, they will not be scheduled for another game for the remainder of the season.

If no team is found, the game will be outright removed from the schedule. The Intramural Sports program does not reschedule any games that teams cancel. Teams are given a -1 rating if they are approved for a cancellation. If a team reaches -3 points at any point in the semester, they will not be scheduled for another game for the remainder of the season.
