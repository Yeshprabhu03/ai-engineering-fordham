## Intramural Sports Participants Conduct and Sportsmanship Rating

-
Any player ejected from an Intramural contest is automatically suspended from that Intramural activity and must meet with the Intramural and Club Sport Manager before being reinstated. The Intramural Sports program reserves the right to impose additional suspensions from Intramural activities pending the result of the meeting. Any player or spectator making physical contact or threatening an Intramural staff member will be immediately suspended from all Intramural activity indefinitely and must meet with the Intrarmural and Club Sport Manager before being reinstated. That participant may also be referred to the Dean of Students. Any player playing under an assumed name, using someone else's ID or myFordham credentials to check in constitutes a blatant violation of the Honor Code. Alcoholic beverages, drugs, and tobacco products are strictly prohibited in any facility and any participant playing under the influence will be immediately ejected and reffered to the Intramural and Club Sport Manager. Captains are responsible for the behavior of their players, as well as their spectators.

Intramural Sports at Fordham University is committed to fostering a safe, healthy and fun atmosphere for all participants during Intramural Sports competition. To ensure this, a sportsmanship rating system is implemented for all regularly scheduled team sports. At the conclusion of each contest, the officials and scorekeeper will assign a score to each team based on behavior, actions and attitude exhibited during the course of play. Behavior before, during and after an Intrmaural contest will be factored into each team's rating. The sportsmanship of a team is the responsibility of the team's captain. Ratings will be given in whole numbers on a scale of 0-4. Teams must maintain a minimum 2.5 rating in order to become eligible for post-season competition. Teams must also maintain this rating during playoffs in order to advance. The rating system is based on, but not limited to, the following criteria:

4.0: Excellent Conduct and Sportsmanship

- Team members cooperate with and demonstrate good sportsmanship toward teammates, opponents, and all members of the staff
- Team captain exhibits control over their teammates and spectators
- Team members demonstrate proper respect for all equipment and the facility
- Team members accept judgement decisions made by the officials during the contest
- The mimimum number of team members needed to start the contest are present, checked in, and ready to play at least 5 minutes prior to game time. Teams who do not meet this standard are ineligible to receive a 4.0 rating

3.0: Good Conduct and Sportsmanship

- Teams begin at this level and, if no positive or negatie actions occur, the team will receive this score
- Team members exhibit good conduct and sportsmanship for the majority of the contest
- Team members verbally complain about some decisions and/or show minor dissension which does not merit a technical foul/unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. Teams who receive one technical foul/unsportsmanlike conduct penalty cannot receive higher than a 3.0 rating
- Team members do not show agressive dissent toward the staff or opposing team

2.0: Below Average Conduct and Sportsmanship

- Team shows verbal dissent toward officials and/or opposing team which may or may not result in a technical foul/unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. Teams who receive multiple technical fouls/unsportsmanlike conduct penalties may not receive higher than a 2.0 rating
- Team captain demonstrates minor control over teammates/spectators and/or does not actively promote good sportsmanship
- Team members occasionally use profanity, although it is not directed toward the staff or opponents
