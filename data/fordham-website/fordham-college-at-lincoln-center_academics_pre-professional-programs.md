Special programs collaborate with Fordham's graduate schools to offer eligible students the opportunity to start earning a professional degree (e.g. MA, MSW, MS) while still in undergraduate college. In addition, students who wish to prepare for specific professional careers can pursue select pre-professional programs at Fordham College at Lincoln Center. These programs provide the necessary grounding in a specific field to prepare the student to pursue further study. Each program has faculty advisers who provide counseling and guidance.

Pre-professional programs include:
