# Pre-Health Program for Fordham College at Lincoln Center Students

With the assistance of the Natural Sciences faculty and members of the PHPP, Fordham College at Lincoln Center has an excellent record of students gaining admission to medical and other health professional schools. To better prepare our students, the PHPP will often invite medical professionals, including Fordham alumni, to speak with students about opportunities in these fields. Additionally, the PHPP adviser meets with our students during the course of their tenure and oversees their development and their application preparation.

Students are strongly encouraged to meet with the pre-health advisor and their primary advisor at least once a year to check in on their academic progress and planning. The pre-health advisor is able to provide advice on clinical and volunteer activities in preparation for aspirant health programs. A successful pre-health experience hinges on frequent contact with advisors and to prepare a successful, robust application, early and consistent participation is extremely beneficial.
