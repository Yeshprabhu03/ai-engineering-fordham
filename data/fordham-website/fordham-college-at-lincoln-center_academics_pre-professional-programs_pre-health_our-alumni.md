## Jacqueline Manelis - 1st Year Dental Student at Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine

When I first came to Fordham, I understood what my major was going to be right off the bat, as I had wanted to pursue a career in healthcare. Not only did the natural science department help me in my academic rigor within the sciences, but the people there instilled the confidence within me to persist and to further question all of what I learned. The faculty not only fostered my determination for the sciences, but a greater interest in providing for the people that I will treat in the future.

## Milana Stein - 3rd Year Medical Student at NYITCOM

Having been a Natural Sciences major and in the Pre-Health track has proven invaluable in medical school. The foundation laid during my undergraduate years prepared me academically and fostered a sense of belonging within a close-knit community. The individualized guidance and mentorship I received continue to resonate as I tackle the rigorous demands of medical school and research. The friendships forged during those years have grown into lifelong bonds, providing support and camaraderie through the challenges of a medical career. I am deeply grateful for the comprehensive preparation and enduring relationships facilitated by the department.

## Michael Singer - Graduate Student Researcher at UC Berkeley

I am a graduate student pursuing a PhD in a field that did not exist 20 years ago. My studies focus on structural changes to bat genomes that have enabled them to evolve some of the most powerful immune mechanisms in nature. This exciting field has emerged from a confluence of innovations in genetic engineering, immunology, and sequencing technologies. I credit my education in the Natural Sciences Department at Fordham University with empowering me to believe graduate school could be right for me, and providing me with the skills to pursue a career in research.

## Andy Cuzco - 1st Year MD at Columbia Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons

I was thrilled to be admitted to Columbia, where I am attending on a full tuition scholarship. I’m so grateful for all the support I received from Fordham. I walked into my committee meeting nervous and unsure what to expect. Fortunately, I quickly realized I had nothing to worry about. I remember everyone being so kind, encouraging, and genuinely interested in getting to know me and my reasons for going into medicine. I left that meeting feeling much more confident about the application journey ahead of me. That meeting pretty much wraps up my experience with the Natural Science faculty during my four years at Fordham - always willing to get their students and committed to their success.
