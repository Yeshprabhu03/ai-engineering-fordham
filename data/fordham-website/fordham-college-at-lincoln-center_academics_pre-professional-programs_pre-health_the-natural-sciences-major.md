The Natural Sciences major at Fordham College at Lincoln Center (FCLC) offers a comprehensive and interdisciplinary education, emphasizing undergraduate training through rigorous coursework, lab experiences, and independent research. The department includes faculty members with expertise in chemistry, physics, data science, and biology who teach courses supporting a variety of majors and programs. Students can choose concentrations in chemical sciences, organismal biology, and cell and molecular biology within the Natural Sciences major. Beyond the needs of students in the PHPP, the department's courses also fulfill requirements for Integrative Neurosciences, Environmental Sciences, the FCLC Honors Program, the Biochemistry major/minor, and the core curriculum. With small class sizes and hands-on lab work, students benefit from personalized attention and mentorship, preparing them for successful careers in fields such as medicine, academia, and education.

The Natural Sciences Department plays a crucial role in the Pre-Health program at FCLC, offering required courses for students aspiring to enter health professions. Although students can major in any field, they can complete all their Pre-Health requirements through the Natural Sciences Department (NSCI), with the exception of Calculus or Applied Calculus, which is provided by the Mathematics Department at FCLC. The department's interdisciplinary approach and rigorous training ensure that Pre-Health students receive a solid foundation in the sciences. By following the recommended curriculum guidelines and engaging in independent research, students are well-prepared for medical school and other health-related graduate programs.
