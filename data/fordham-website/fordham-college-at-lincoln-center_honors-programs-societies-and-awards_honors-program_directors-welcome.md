# Director's Welcome

Welcome! And thanks for visiting our page. It’s been my pleasure to direct FCLC Honors since 2023.

I’ve been a college professor for over two decades and a Fordham faculty member for more than a dozen of those years, but directing FCLC Honors—and, in particular, working with our amazing students—has been easily the most rewarding part of my career.

FCLC Honors combines the full academic breadth of liberal arts and sciences education here at Fordham with access to the world-class resources of New York City. The program unites a broad foundation with a tailored educational experience.

We start broad: in their first and second years, our students are offered the dual foundation of a rigorous intellectual experience through the Honors core, and a strong sense of community through the small cohort and seminar classes.

The experience then becomes more tailored: with that dual foundation in place, students pursue a highly individualized journey through all the opportunities Fordham and New York can provide—including the full range of majors, room for a double major or major and minor, and opportunities to study abroad.

FCLC Honors is a place where students uncover new interests and questions, follow their dreams, and discover how education helps to make meaning out of life’s experiences.

Please explore our website, read through our frequently asked questions, and don’t hesitate to reach out if we can help you make decisions about whether FCLC Honors is right for you. If you’d like to meet with me or with some of our students when you visit campus, just inform the admissions office [when you make your arrangements](https://www.fordham.edu/undergraduate-admission/visit/).

Sincerely,

Jordan Alexander Stein

Director, FCLC Honors Program

Professor of English and Comparative Literature
