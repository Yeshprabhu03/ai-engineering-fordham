# Foreign Language Requirement

## Placement and Sequencing

Fordham's [Department of Languages and Cultures](/academics/departments/languages-and-cultures/) and [Department of Classics](/academics/departments/classics/) offer students numerous ways to fulfill the foreign language requirement. Depending on your major course of study, however, you may not be subject to this requirement. Where you are placed as an incoming student can affect your course schedule significantly, so it's vital to be informed about what's required of you.

-
### For BA Degrees

Completion of 2001 level ("exit level") is required. Sequence for absolute beginners is 1001, 1501, 1502, 2001.

### For BS Degrees (Except Psychology)

No language requirement.

### Psychology Majors

If you are pursuing the pre-health sequencing of Biology I & II, Chemistry I & II, Physics I & II, and Organic Chemistry I & II, you are exempt from the language requirement. Otherwise, you will need to complete the 2001 level course of a modern or classical language.

If you wish to continue studying:

### French, German, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, or Spanish

You must take an online placement test. Visit the

[Department of Languages and Cultures](/academics/departments/languages-and-cultures/)website for more information.### Arabic, Italian, or Japanese

You must enroll (or be placed) in the appropriate course level according to the following number of years that you have studied the foreign language. Visit the

[Department of Languages and Cultures](/academics/departments/languages-and-cultures/)website for more information.- 4 years of the language and a GPA >3.5 : enroll in 1502
- 4 years of the language and a GPA <3.5 : enroll 1501

### Ancient Greek or Latin

The Office of Academic Records, in consultation with the Department of Classics, will assess your high school coursework and performance therein and place you into the appropriate course. If you decide to continue studying Ancient Greek or Latin at a later time (i.e. after leaving a BS degree major or switching languages), contact the

[Associate Chair](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7303161a01101633151c01171b121e5d161706)of the Department of Classics. -
### Beginning a Modern Language

To begin a modern language, you should take (or will be placed) in the introductory intensive (5-credit) course, numbered 1001, of the language of your choice (i.e., ARAB 1001, GERM 1001, ITAL 1001, etc.).

You will then need to take Intermediate I (1501), Intermediate II (1502), and finally Literature (2001).

### Beginning a Classical Language

If you wish to begin Ancient Greek or Latin, you will begin by taking the 1001 level, then 1002, 1501, and 2001. There is neither a 5-credit intensive nor an "Intermediate II" (1502) course for these languages.
