**Title of Research:** The Impact of Dance Education in Post-conflict Communities: A Case Study of Quetzaltenango, Guatemala

**Mentor:** Dr. Ed Bristow**Abstract:** From 1960 to 1996 the Guatemalan Civil War, fought between the harsh military state and leftist guerilla forces, fostered a society characterized by brutal repression, state-sponsored campaigns of terror, and armed internal conflict. While the signing of the Peace Accords in 1996 began the country’s transition to democracy and gradual demilitarization of the state, there are still enduring effects of this violent period which are salient in present-day Guatemala. This research explores the implementation of a five-week dance and movement education in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala to foster social healing in this post-conflict community through the development of effective leadership and community building skills in young students. Additionally, this investigation draws attention to the lack of dance research in post-conflict communities and critiques the eurocentric nature of previous dance scholarship. My research demonstrates the potential of including dance and the arts in discussions about post-war community development and peace-building processes.
