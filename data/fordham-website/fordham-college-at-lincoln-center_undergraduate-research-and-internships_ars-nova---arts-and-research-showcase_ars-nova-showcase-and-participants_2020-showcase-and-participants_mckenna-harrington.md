**Major:** Theatre Performance**Bio: **McKenna was born in Washington, D.C. and moved to Mexico City with her family when she was five. Her love of acting began while performing in Spanish for her school plays. She continued to perform upon moving back to the U.S. to attend high school in Nashville, TN. McKenna is now an Equity NYC-based actor.**Title of Research: **Theatrical Producing Project at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival

**Mentor: **Professor Stefanie Bubnis**Abstract:** Last summer, thanks to receiving the Dean’s research grant, my classmates and I performed Dark Play or Stories For Boys by Carlos Murillo at the esteemed International Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland. Having just come off of a three-night run of Murillo’s play in one of our blackbox theatres at Lincoln Center, we wanted the chance to utilize our ‘theatrical toolkit’ outside the umbrella of Fordham by taking the production beyond the walls of Lowenstein. The show was a great success in Scotland. We had sold-out houses and were included in the “Top Ten LGBTQ shows at the Fringe.” I put together a short video to document our journey.
