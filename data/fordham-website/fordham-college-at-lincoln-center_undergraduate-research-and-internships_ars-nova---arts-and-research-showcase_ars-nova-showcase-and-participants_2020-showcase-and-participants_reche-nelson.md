**Title of Research:** 4:44

**Partners: **Kali Oliver, Samara Steele, and Rachel Yoo

**Mentor: **Emily Riehle**Abstract:** This piece entitled 4:44 is an exploration of grief. Grief is experienced in a very personal way flowing in and out of a 5 stage cycle Kubler-Ross has pinpointed: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. These 5 stages look and feel different for everyone and grappling with loss takes a lifetime. When someone has passed away, you not only grieve the physical entity of the loved one and the memories, but you also grieve the potential that has gone with that person. The potential to experience weddings, graduations, birthdays, laughs, hugs, breakdowns, and accomplishments also dies. This piece attempts to embody the complexities of experiencing lost potential. I would also like to dedicate this to my late grandmother Fredeva Nelson.
