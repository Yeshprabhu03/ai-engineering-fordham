**Title of Research:** Chitin Solubility in Salt Solutions**Partner: ** Nour Aborageh**Faculty Mentor:** Dr. Marie Thomas**Abstract:** Chitin is a cheap bio-renewable and bio-degradable resource that has the potential to decrease our reliance on petroleum feedstocks. Chitin is completely insoluble in most organic and inorganic solvents; however, it hits all the criteria in terms of diversified functionalities in applications. For our project, we used lithium chloride/dimethylacetamide (LiCl/DMA) as our solvent to dissolve chitin. LiCl/DMA is a solvent that other scientists have used to dissolve chitin bringing favorable results; chitin that was dissolved became more malleable and was regenerated into films, threads and microspheres. However, the parameters for dissolution were not clear in the literature. Dr. Thomas and I worked together over the summer to determine the best parameters for dissolution of chitin in LiCl/DMA, so that we could apply them to processes that will be developed using ionic liquids.
