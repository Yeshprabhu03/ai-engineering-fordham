**Title of Research:** The Antibacterial Activity of DABCO Salts

**Mentors: **Dr. Marie Thomas**Abstract:** We synthesized three quaternary ammonium salts (QAS), which may be ionic liquids, to test their antimicrobial abilities when incorporated into polymers. These QASs had a 1,4- diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) head, one or two alkyl chains, and one or two halide counterions. We hypothesized that salts with longer alkyl chains would have more of an antimicrobial effect than shorter chains. This is consistent with published reports regarding materials of this type, so we varied the length of the alkyl chain from seven to sixteen carbons. In addition to varying the chain, we also added a benzyl group to the other nitrogen, creating a dicationic structure. We tested the activity of three of these salts on two gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli and Escherichia aerogenes , and two gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus megaterium. The gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to the DABCO compounds than the gram-negative bacteria, but the dicationic compound was most effective against the bacteria.
