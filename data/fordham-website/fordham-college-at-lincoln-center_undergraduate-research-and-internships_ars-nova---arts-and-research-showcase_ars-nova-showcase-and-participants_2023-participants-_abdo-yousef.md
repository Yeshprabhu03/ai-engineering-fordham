**Project Title:** Algerian Political Expression & Folk Music

**Faculty Mentor:** Aseel Sawalha, Department of Anthropology

**Abstract:**

Taboo subjects, counter-cultural themes, and progressive attitudes are central tenants of the Algerian Raï music genre, yet its continued production has stagnated since the end of the civil war. Contextualizing a modern Algeria finds a conservative government and a history of repression towards an outlet that gave Algerians escape, resistance, and revolution throughout their struggle. In this paper, I explore how folk music serves the Algerian people in political affiliation and positions towards emerging world issues. With my travel to Algiers, I provide the sentiments Algerians have surrounding the lack of a modern Raï, struggles with a politically and economically stagnant country, and views on pressing global situations. This paper will shed light on the mode of expression music provides for revolutionary sentiments and highlight the consequences of a society lacking such an outlet.
