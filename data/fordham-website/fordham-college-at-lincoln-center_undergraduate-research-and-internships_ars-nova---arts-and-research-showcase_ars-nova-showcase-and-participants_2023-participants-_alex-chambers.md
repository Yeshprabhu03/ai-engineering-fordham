**Project Title:** Points of View

**Faculty Mentor:** Ross McLaren, Department of Visual Arts

**Abstract:** Points of View is an experimental film focused on exploring artistic mediums and visual communication. In order to understand the relationship between artistic medium and message, the film was shot entirely on 16mm and the stock was repurposed to create physical artworks based on the film. In using the same stock, Points of View asks if depicting the same story or themes across different mediums has the power to alter the way people perceive and understand a concept at a purely visual level. In order to emphasize the visual, Points of View is a silent film. The storyline similarly addresses how perspective shapes our lives, as it follows a person through a day in their life, opening with the mundane, exploding into a chaotic dream world, and concluding in a world that blends the two in order to explain how the most ideal state is one in which your reality and your inner mind are able to creatively coexist. This was largely achieved through production design, with an emphasis on exploring contrast and using sets to explain the psyche of an individual. Points of View functions as a film and art installation to create an immersive experience where one watches a film while surrounded by the physical material that created those images.
