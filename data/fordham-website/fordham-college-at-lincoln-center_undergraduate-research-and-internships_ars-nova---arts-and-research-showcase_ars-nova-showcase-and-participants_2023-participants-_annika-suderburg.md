**Major:** English and Art History

**Bio: **Originally from Los Angeles, Annika is pursuing a dual degree in Art History and English with a creative writing concentration. In her spare time, she enjoys painting and traveling.

**Title of Research:** Untitled Novel

**Faculty Mentor:** Mary Bly, English Department

**Abstract:** My untitled novel is about a family’s move from Sweden to New York. After receiving the Dean’s Creative Practice Grant, I was able to travel to Sweden to conduct research. Since the novel’s narrative is dependent on the effects of the midnight sun, I first traveled to the far northern town of Kiruna. To clarify, the midnight sun is the phenomenon that occurs above the arctic summer during summer months, when the sun shines during both day and night. During my stay in Kiruna, I focused on tracking the visual and psychological effects of extended light on sleep cycles and how the local population adjusted to this unusual sun schedule. In Stockholm and Gothenburg, I focused on analyzing mental health practices while learning about Swedish cultural practices. I devoted the rest of my time to writing the novel itself. I mostly wrote about setting and character while in Sweden and continued the writing process upon my return. Over the summer, I developed the narrative more fully and wrote a selection of excerpts. This is an ongoing project which I continue to work on independently.
