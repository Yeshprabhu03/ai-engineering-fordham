**Title of Research:** The Road to the White Coat: Investigating the Influence of Demographic and Psychosocial Factors on the Mental Health of Undergraduate Pre-medical Students

**Mentor: **Dr. Ann Higgins-D'Alessandro, Department of Psychology

**Abstract:** The formative years of undergraduate education are a critical period of development and self-discovery for college students as they transition into adulthood and embark upon their academic journeys. For pre-medical students, however, this period may be fraught with additional challenges, owing to the rigors of their educational pursuits. Despite the importance of this topic, research on the unique difficulties faced by undergraduate pre-medical students is limited. This present study aims to shed light on the potential factors that may contribute to mental health issues among this population and to provide a foundation for future research and interventions aimed at promoting their well-being. A cross-sectional survey was conducted online among a sample of 333 undergraduate pre-medical students in America, consisting of demographic questions and several measures to identify depression, anxiety, and stress. Binary logistic regressions revealed that racial/ethnic minorities and upperclassmen were particularly at risk for mental health challenges. Furthermore, various psychosocial factors such as inadequate academic advising and academic workload and difficulty were found to be risk factors for mental health problems in pre-med students. However, SES was not found to be a significant predictor. These findings have important implications for more specialized institutional support for pre-medical students, including academic advising and potential improvements to the pre-med curriculum. The study highlights the need for future research to explore the connections between academic performance and mental health, as well as protective factors for pre-med mental health, in order to develop more effective interventions both within and outside the academic setting.
