**Project Title:** Framework for Corruption and Poverty with Special Application to Sri Lanka

**Faculty Mentor:** Janis Barry, Department of Economics

**Abstract:** The impact of poverty and corruption on growing countries raises the question of how certain countries can flourish while debt and minimal development tie down others. Multiple scholarly works on poverty and corruption have bridged the gap for this discrepancy in economic development. I use Sri Lanka as a case study of a third-world country experiencing high levels of corruption to showcase its role in rising poverty levels while posing limitations on the country’s maximum potential for growth. My research explores bribery in the judicial system (Wu 2009), misdirected aid intended for humanitarian organizations (Stirrat 2006), and corruption in policing (Lindberg & Orjuela 2011). Through this, I explore the factors that foster a more productive economy in Sri Lanka.
