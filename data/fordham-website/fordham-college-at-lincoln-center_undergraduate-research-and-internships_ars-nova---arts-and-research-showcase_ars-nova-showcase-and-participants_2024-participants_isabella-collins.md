**MAJOR: **Psychology (Pre-Health Program)

**BIO:** Isabella R. Collins is a senior at Fordham College at Lincoln Center studying Psychology on the Pre-Health track. In her tenure at Fordham she has worked with Dr. Guy Robinson in his Paleoecology lab and has presented data from their findings at both the Mary G. Hamilton Symposium as well as the Eastern Colleges Science Conference. The Art of Anatomy will be published in FURJ this spring. Collins anticipates attending medial school to establish her career as a forensic pathologist.

**PROJECT TITLE:** The Art of Anatomy

**MENTOR:** Guy Robinson, Department of Natural Sciences

**ABSTRACT: **This paper examines the interdisciplinary relationship between art and anatomy formed during the Italian Renaissance and pioneered by Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo Buonarroti, and Andreas Vesalias. In examining this culturally significant period in history, I explain how the aforementioned artist-anatomists each merged the separate subjects in their own ways, how this connection continued on throughout history, as well as how it enhanced the fields of both art and anatomy in separate ways. My research was conducted through literary analysis of academic papers as well as published books such as biographies of the artist subjects. I compiled the information from the literature review and referred to it as evidence to support my above-mentioned argument. This paper reminds its readers that the disciplines of art and science are not as isolated from one another as can be inferred. By pioneering the marriage of art and anatomy, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Andreas Vesalias changed the disciplines and how they are taught forever. The Art of Anatomy was accepted to the Fordham Undergraduate Research Journal and is expected to be published this upcoming spring (2024). I would like to thank Dr. Guy Robinson of Fordham's Natural Sciences Department for agreeing to mentor my personal research project as well as as working with me on his Paleoecology research.
