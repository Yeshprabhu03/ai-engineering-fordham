**MAJOR: **Psychology

**BIO:** Sarah Shahin is a senior at FCLC majoring in Psychology. She joined the Critical Health + Social Ecology lab under PI Dr. Shellae Versey in the Fall of 2023. There, she conducted a secondary data analysis on the 2017 Health and Activism study, investigating mental distress variations between white and ethnic minoritized undergraduates due to increased role demand. Post-graduation, she aims for a career in clinical research to continue exploring mental health gaps among diverse populations.

**PROJECT TITLE:** Balancing Act: Exploring the Link Between Role Demand and Mental Distress Among Ethnic Minority Undergraduates

**MENTOR:** Dr. Shellae Versey, Department of Psychology

**ABSTRACT: **Role demand refers to the social, academic and personal responsibilities and expectations individuals must simultaneously manage within their daily lives. For undergraduate students, role demands can become overwhelming due to the increased pressure to excel academically, participate in extracurricular activities, and maintain a social life, leading to heightened levels of stress and burnout. Current research has shown that in ethnic minorities, this load may be exacerbated by additional systemic challenges and discrimination, further intensifying the impact on their well-being. The secondary analysis utilized data from the 2017 Health and Activism study to determine the relationship between role demand and mental distress levels among undergraduate students. The present study aimed to explore the variability of this relationship between white young adults and racial-ethnic minoritized adults, as well as how its impact might vary across different income levels. The findings of the study indicated that ethnic minority students experience a higher level of role demand compared to their white peers, which correlates to heightened levels of mental distress. However, socioeconomic status was not found to be a significant factor in moderating this relationship. Implications for future research may elucidate strategies for mitigating role demand and promoting mental well-being, particularly tailored to ethnic minoritized students and the unique stressors they face throughout their college careers.
