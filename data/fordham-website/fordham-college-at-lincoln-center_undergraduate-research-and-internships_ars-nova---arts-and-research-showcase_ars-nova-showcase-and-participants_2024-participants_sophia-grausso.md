**PROJECT TITLE:** Flâneuse: A Walk Alongside The Wolves

**MENTOR:** Anne Fernald, Department of English and Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies

**ABSTRACT: **“Flâneuse” is a creative research project which explores the literary tradition of Virginia Woolf and Sylvia Plath to develop a pedagogy further stimulating my own writing and self-revision. Plath and Woolf were chosen specifically for their emphasis on walking in their writing practice as well as their dedication to keeping writing notebooks and continually revising and rewriting their work, and therefore the self. Over the course of Summer 2023, I was able to conduct archival research at Smith College Special Collections, home to Plath’s archives, and The New York Public Library Berg Collection, home to a wide array of Woolf’s papers, to better understand their writing process before embarking on a literary lineage journey to London, Paris, and Edinburgh. Through my travels I was not only able to connect deeper with Plath and Woolf’s surroundings, but channel a distinct defamiliarization to better inform my writing in specific reference to a novel I have been working on since 2021. I plan to cultivate a literary collection of personal essays, fiction, and academic analysis of Plath and Woolf available for viewing at Ars Nova.

I would like to recognize Anne Fernald for serving as my summer research advisor, and Dr. Mary Bly who has advised the curation of “Flâneuse” as a literary collection in the months since.
