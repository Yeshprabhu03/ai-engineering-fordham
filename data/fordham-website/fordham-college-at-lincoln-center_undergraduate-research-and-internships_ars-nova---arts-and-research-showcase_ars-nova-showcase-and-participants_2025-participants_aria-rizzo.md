**Title of Research:** The Formylation of Primary and Secondary Amine Hydrochloride Salts with Triethyl Orthoformate

**Mentor(s):** Martin J. Di Grandi, Ph.D., Natural Sciences

**Abstract:** Previous research demonstrated that primary and secondary amines could be converted to amides by reacting amine hydrochlorides with orthoesters. It is understood from previous research that the synthesis of formamides is possible, but usually requires harsh conditions or exotic reagents. The purpose of this project was to determine whether or not microwave conditions and triethyl orthoformate were suitable for converting the amine salts to their corresponding formamide. There are many purposes for synthesizing these formamides, including forming protected amines and for use as intermediates for heterocycles, and as intermediates for various drugs. A total of ten different amine salts were reacted with a combination of triethyl orthoformate and a solvent in determined amounts and placed under microwave radiation, after which, the resulting solid was isolated by methods such as rotary evaporation and vacuum filtration. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance was used to confirm whether the resultant products were the appropriate formamide products. Primary amines resulted in secondary formamides, and secondary amines resulted in tertiary formamides. Conclusions of the research determined that microwave radiation resulted in appropriate products, substantially lowered reaction times, and comparable yields compared to conventional heating, making the research project successful.
