**Title of Research:** The Dynamics of Social Stratification in Beach Recreation: The Case of Robert Moses State Park

**Mentor: **Aseel Sawalha, Ph.D., Sociology and Anthropology

**Abstract:** This research was conducted with the support of the Fordham College at Lincoln Center Dean's Undergraduate Research and Creative Practice Grant, which provided funding for transportation, research materials, and, when appropriate, food for participants during interviews or shared visits to Robert Moses Beach. The methodology was designed to integrate qualitative and ethnographic techniques to explore the cultural, social, and historical dynamics of Robert Moses Beach. To gain insights into personal experiences and perceptions of Robert Moses Beach, I conducted open-ended interviews with individuals from my personal network and individuals I met at Robert Moses Beach who had varying relationships with the site. This research investigates the existence of social stratification in beach recreation and questions how a space should be designed for accessibility. As time goes on, a space may or may not change over time to meet the needs of its population. Many spaces exist that are kept as more separated and inaccessible. The findings of this research will demonstrate observations of how Robert Moses State Park operates and exists. The observations will include elements from the beach’s infrastructure, political economy, and its users of space. This is significant because it will allow for assessing how recreational spaces are used and who has access to them.
