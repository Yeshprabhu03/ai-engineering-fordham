**Major:** Integrative Neuroscience Concentrating in Cellular Molecular Studies

**Bio:** Hi, I am Isabella Pelosi, a junior Integrative Neuroscience student concentrating in Cellular Molecular studies, and minoring in Biological Ethics at Fordham University Lincoln Center. I am passionate about all things science-related, including; environmental studies, neurology, medicine, and chemistry. I am originally from Downingtown, Pennsylvania. Some of my main interests outside of my studies are dance, coffee, and cats.

**Title of Research:** A Comparative Analysis of Nitrogen Dioxide and Particulate Matter Levels in Urban and Suburban Pennsylvania, and the Rocky Mountain National Park

**Research Partner: **Amalia Trujillo

**Mentor:** Marie Thomas, Ph.D., Natural Science

**Abstract:** The objective of this study was to compare the levels of nitrogen dioxide [NO2 ] and particulate matter [PM] found in the Rocky Mountains (RMNP) to that of suburban and metropolitan areas in Pennsylvania. We hope to identify whether the millions of tourists visiting the RMNP are causing car pollutant levels to mimic an urban city. We used air quality monitors to analyze the level of NO2 and PM at one of the entrances to the park. This data could encourage parks to charge a premium for combustion engine cars so that tourists either opt to carpool, rent an EV, or simply take the shuttle bus during their trip.
