**Title of Research:** Where Time Does Not Go By

**Mentor:** Patricia Belen, Visual Arts/New Media and Digital Design

**Abstract:** "Where Time Does Not Go By” is a children’s book about a young boy named Sola who goes on a journey to find a place where time does not go by. He encounters his friends along the way and experiences their own versions of this place.

Each of the characters are based on personal discussions with four of my closest friends on their perceptions of time. I asked them, “When/where in your life does time slow down?” From this, we discussed topics of loneliness and stress in our busy, fast-paced lives. Sola’s story showcases the uniqueness in others’ experiences of this very common yet abstract feeling.

The conversations I had with my friends were based on our experiences as college students in our twenties. However, I chose to explore this topic in the form of a children’s book because I believe the emotions it brings are applicable and valuable for children. The purpose of this book was to demonstrate the nuisances that children’s media can have while still appealing to a wide range of audiences. In writing and illustrating my book, I took heavy inspiration from iconic children’s stories such as “The Little Prince” and “The Giving Tree” which cover themes of love, friendship, and loss. I examined their impact on readers who look back and experience the story differently later in life. In addition, I researched how and why some children’s media can appeal to adult audiences, using shows such as “Steven Universe” and “The Powerpuff Girls.”
