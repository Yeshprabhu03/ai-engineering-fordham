**Title of Research:** Immigrants’ Inhumanity to Immigrants: The Failings of Modern US Immigration Policies through the Lens of Mauritanian Asylum Seekers

**Mentor: **Isaie Dougnon, Ph.D., French and Francophone Studies & International Humanitarian Affairs

**Abstract: **By analyzing firsthand accounts of Mauritanian migrants gathered at The Migrant Center of St. Francis Church of Assisi, this paper explores the systemic inequities of U.S. immigration law and enforcement, particularly its impact on African migrants. The research argues that these lived experiences expose the disconnect between official narratives of welcoming migrants and the harsh realities of the immigration system, making a case for a more humane and equitable framework. This will be accomplished by first setting the scene on Mauritania and the culture and history that backs up how the migrants act and why they chose America to emigrate. Their journey is perilous and highlighted throughout the paper, making sure it is understood that leaving one’s home country is no easy feat. Through these examinations, this paper will explore the systemic inequities of US Immigration law and enforcement, highlighting the racialized context they exist in despite aiming to be “race-neutral.” This paper will conclude with how to make US Immigration law and enforcement more humane and welcoming.
