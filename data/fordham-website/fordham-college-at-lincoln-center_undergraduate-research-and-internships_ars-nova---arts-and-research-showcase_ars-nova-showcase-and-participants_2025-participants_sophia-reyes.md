# Sophia Reyes, FCLC 2025

**Major:** Natural Science

**Bio:** Sophia Reyes is a senior majoring in Natural Sciences on the pre-dental track. After graduation, she plans to attend dental school to obtain her D.D.S.. At Fordham University, she worked under the mentorship of Dr. Jason Morris, and outside of school, she currently works as a dental assistant for a general dentist. In her free time, Sophia enjoys playing tennis and lifting weights as well as restaurant hopping around the city.

**Title of Research:** Constructing TRPM Gain-of-Function Alleles in Drosophila melanogaster

**Mentor:** Jason Morris, Natural Sciences

**Abstract:** In Drosophila melanogaster, egg activation is activated by TRPM channels, which are mechanosensitive ion channels. When mature eggs are released from the ovaries, they travel through the oviduct, where they encounter mechanical pressure. This mechanical pressure activates the TRPM ion channels in the egg membrane, allowing a significant influx of calcium ions into the cytoplasm. The rise in intracellular calcium levels triggers egg activation.

Constructing a TRPM gain of function allele in Drosophila melanogaster can be used as a model to identify the effect the overexpressed TRPM gene will have on the calcium levels that trigger egg activation. Since humans and Drosophila melanogaster share a significant genetic similarity, the TRPM allele in humans is used as a model organism to construct this modified allele. Many molecular biological techniques are utilized to construct a TRPM gain of function allele. From producing cDNA with reverse transcription to designing primers and utilizing polymerase chain reactions to inserting our gene of interest into a vector using Gibson assembly to combine all our fragments into our construct. Results of this study were not applicable as the study was incomplete to obtain results.
