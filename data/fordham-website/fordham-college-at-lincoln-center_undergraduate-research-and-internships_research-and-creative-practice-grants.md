- If the project works with human subjects (i.e., interviews, capturing people's identifying images or information), speak with your faculty mentor about IRB and visit the
[Institutional Review Board](/academics/research/institutional-review-board/). You will likely need to do[an IRB training](/academics/research/institutional-review-board/submission-and-review-process/)before you begin research, which should be listed in your schedule. - The schedule should indicate meetings with the faculty mentor before, during, and after the research/project period.

- A budget for the project, including housing, commuting expenses, living expenses, travel expenses if research requires a trip outside of New York City, and any other costs associated with research (e.g., materials; photocopying or printing; library, archive or museum entrance fees, etc.), up to a maximum of $4,000.
- There is a book and journal budget cap of $100. If more is needed, provide evidence that these materials are unavailable via the Fordham Library, Interlibrary Loan, or NY Public Libraries, and include details in the budget.

**Note on budget expenditures for equipment:**

**For those planning to use and/or buy audio-visual technology such as cameras, recorders, microphones, etc.,**** there are two options to either**:

- Rent equipment, in which case include the expected rates in the budget, or:
- Identify equipment to be purchased by Fordham for your project’s use.

For both options, you must schedule a consultation with the Educational Technologist, Christopher Vicari - [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), at least **three weeks before the application due date**. If there is already adequate equipment, the Educational Technologist will help you reserve it for the project duration. If it is found that additional equipment is needed, you can outline what is needed in the application budget, and upon approval, it will be purchased and managed by the Education Technologist. All equipment must be returned to the Fordham Communication and Media Studies department at the end of the project.

**The application deadline for the 2026 FCLC Dean’s Undergraduate Research and Creative Practice grants is March 6, 2026.**

An informational and grant application-writing workshop will be held **Thursday, February 12, 2026, from 12 - 1:30 p.m. in the South Lounge in the Lowenstein building. **Students applying for grant funding for independent projects are advised to attend.
