# Message from the Dean at Fordham College at Rose Hill

## Welcome to Fordham College at Rose Hill

Established over 170 years ago and deeply rooted in the Jesuit tradition, the College has educated generations of men and women committed to academic excellence and to serving the wider world in which they live.

We are an outstanding liberal arts college, benefiting from the resources of a major research university and centered in one of the world’s greatest cities. Our first-rate faculty of dedicated teachers and scholars provides an [exciting, challenging curriculum](/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/academics/core-curriculum/). New York City offers countless cultural excursions, internships, and service opportunities.

**The Student Experience**

When students enter Fordham College at Rose Hill, they join a thriving intellectual community. Across the humanities, the social sciences, and the sciences our students pursue a remarkably diverse array of majors and develop the critical, analytical abilities to excel in a wide range of fields. With an enrollment of approximately 3,900, our classes are small, and our faculty provides in-depth advising, giving individual students exceptional opportunities to engage in undergraduate research and share in the excitement of creating new knowledge.

Fordham College at Rose Hill also encourages its students to consider broader questions of social justice and personal responsibility. As they discern and prepare for their own professional and personal callings, our students seek to enrich the lives of others, at home and abroad.

We invite you to come visit us at Rose Hill.
