We encourage you to discuss your interests with your advisor and schedule meetings with the department associate chair or program director to learn more. Please consult this [list](https://www.fordham.edu/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/student-resources/academic-resources/contacts-for-majors-and-minors/) of departmental/program contacts for FCRH students.

When you are ready to declare, you will complete a "Major/Minor/Concentration Form" available under "Student Electronic Forms" on your Fordham portal.

## Deadlines and Suggestions

Sophomores, Major Declaration Day is on Thursday, March 6th! Some majors and minors require that you meet with the Department or Program first, so it is important that you meet with your advisor and know what steps you need to take. When you come and declare your major, there will be advisors on hand to answer any questions you may have, and you will receive a small gift celebrating this step in your college career. If you have already declared your major, we hope you’ll still stop by to collect your gift!

**Sophomores, Major Declaration Day is the deadline to declare your major**.

Your Advisor Hold for Fall 2025 registration will not be lifted until you declare your major.

### Major Declaration Day:

**Rose Hill - March 6, 2025**11 a.m.-2 p.m.

Location TBD
