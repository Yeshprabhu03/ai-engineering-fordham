# Graduate School: What to Expect

## Research in Graduate School

As a graduate student, the bulk of your time will be spent learning how to conduct different types of research; as a professor or researcher, you will be required to conduct intensive research as part of your professional obligations. If you enjoy conducting research, then the pursuit of a graduate degree is probably for you. If not, then you should seriously reconsider your motivation for attending graduate school.

## Graduate Student Life

The pursuit of a graduate degree also requires a significant commitment of time on your part. You will be in school for a number of years - a master's degree typically takes 2 years to complete, and a doctorate can take anywhere from 5 to 8 years. During this time, your social life will most likely revolve around other people in your graduate program, you may have very little free time, and you will have very little extra money. Most of your energies and life decisions will be structured by your role as a graduate student. Thus, you need to ask yourself:

- Do you need an advanced degree to attain your career goals?

- Do you need an advanced degree now? Can you afford to go to graduate school full time?

- Have you met the academic prerequisites to pursue your desired course of study?

- If you have answered these questions in the affirmative, then you have probably made the correct decision to pursue a graduate degree.
