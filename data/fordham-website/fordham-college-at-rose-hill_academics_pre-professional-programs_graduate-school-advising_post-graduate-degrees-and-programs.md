# Post-Graduate Degrees and Programs

Professional programs offer academic and professional preparation for a particular profession (e.g., Law, Social Work, Medicine, etc.). Graduate schools in the arts and sciences, on the other hand, offer academic degrees in particular disciplines, the goal of which is to prepare students to pursue careers in research or academia.

### Should I Pursue a Master's or Doctoral Degree?

You should pursue a masters degree if you are uncertain about your career path, as a first step if you are changing fields, in preparation for a terminal degree, or as a means of advancing in your current field.

You should pursue a doctoral degree if you are certain that you intend to pursue a career in university-level teaching and/or advanced research. Be aware, however, that if you do not have a strong academic background, you may need to pursue a master’s degree first in order to prove that you are capable of doctoral-level work.
