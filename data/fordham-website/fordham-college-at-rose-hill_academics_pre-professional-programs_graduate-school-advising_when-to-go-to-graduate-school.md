## When To Go To Graduate School

You should seriously consider going to graduate school directly after completing your undergraduate degree if you plan on entering a field that requires an advanced degree in order to obtain an entry-level position.

If, however, you plan to enter a field that values work experience as well as an advanced degree, then you should consider taking some time off after completing your undergraduate degree before applying to graduate school. In many instances, employers will want you to have some initial work experience, so make certain that you ask your major professors and others in your field to determine how and when they recommend furthering your education. Also, take into consideration how you intend to pay for graduate school. Some industries will pay or help defray the costs of graduate education for their employees. If this is the case in your intended field, then it might benefit you to take some time off of school and work for a few years before pursuing a graduate degree.

You should also consider taking some time off after completing your undergraduate degree if you feel burnt out after college or if you are unsure of your career goals. In this case, it may be best to take some time and reflect on your goals before making such a significant commitment.
