# 3-3 Law Program for FCRH Students

The 3-3 Program enables students to move on to Fordham's School of Law after three years of study at Fordham. The BA or BS is awarded following the completion of the first year of law school.

Participation requires that students:

- Complete all core and major requirements and at least 92 credits before beginning law school.
- Maintain a superior grade point average (3.67 or above), including transfer credits.
- Have a very strong LSAT score (93rd percentile or above). It is preferable that your LSAT score be available by December of the academic year in which the application is being made. Note that this means that you may have to take the LSAT during your sophomore year.
- Students who meet these criteria become eligible to be considered for application to the Fordham School of Law during their junior year. Interested students should meet with their academic advisors early on to make sure they complete all necessary undergraduate courses and credits.

Students who intend to participate in the 3-3 program must have an interview with a Pre-Law Advisor, who may then forward your name to the Director of Admissions at Fordham's School of Law. Admission is not guaranteed and is very competitive. You should meet Fordham University School of Law's criteria for admissions which can vary from year to year.

Because of the condensed nature of the undergraduate program, students who intend to apply to the 3-3 Program are strongly discouraged from seeking out study abroad options.
