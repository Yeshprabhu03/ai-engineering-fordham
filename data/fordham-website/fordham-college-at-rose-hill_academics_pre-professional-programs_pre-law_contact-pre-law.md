# Pre-Law Contact Information for FCRH students

## Who We Are

### Pre-Law at Fordham at a Glance

The Pre-Law Advising Program at Fordham College at Rose Hill and Fordham College at Lincoln Center is a multi-campus office, designed to assist Fordham students with information about applying to law school, and the legal profession. We feature individual pre-law advising as well as group meetings, assistance with selecting a major, admissions strategies for applying to law school, and information about the LSAT, the Law School Admissions Council, and other information relating to applying to law school and legal careers.

### Pre-Law Advising Team

The Arts & Sciences leadership team oversees pre-law advising for all FCRH and FCLC students. We are staffed by the Vice Dean for Undergraduate Education, Dr. Rachel Annunziato, the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education, Dr. Robert Moniot, and coming soon a dedicated Assistant Dean for Pre-Professional Advising! Our team is so happy to connect you to dedicated pre-law advisors as well, lead by [Star Jimenez,](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6b180102060e050e115a522b0d04190f030a06450e0f1e) a lawyer, who also serves in the dean's offices as one of our directors.
