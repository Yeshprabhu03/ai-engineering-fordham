# Information for Transfer Students

**Transfer Student Guide**

Founded in 1841, Fordham College at Rose Hill (FCRH) is a prestigious college of liberal arts and sciences and is the oldest and largest of the ten schools of Fordham University. Grounded in the Jesuit tradition of education, FCRH is a community in which students work closely with an outstanding faculty, prepare for leadership in a wide range of careers, and realize their full intellectual and personal potential.

All FCRH students complete a liberal arts [core curriculum](/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/academics/core-curriculum/) that is designed to develop critical thinking, clear expression, scientific understanding, an awareness of historical perspective and contemporary challenges, and an appreciation of religious, philosophical, and moral values. Students have the opportunity to select from more than 50 [majors](/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/academics/majors-and-minors/) across the humanities, the sciences, and the social sciences.

Below you will find some important information for prospective and incoming transfer students. We also encourage you to consult our Core Advising "[Essential Resources](/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/student-resources/academic-resources/)," either as a glimpse of what your Fordham education will look like, or for helpful guidance on your specific questions here and now.
