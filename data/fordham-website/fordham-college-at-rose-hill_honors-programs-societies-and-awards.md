Students at Fordham College Rose Hill who excel within our rigorous curriculum are recognized for their performance throughout their academic career. Our mission is to produce and promote a community of scholars for justice. We achieve our mission through a curriculum that in some substantive way focuses on the concerns of diversity and justice in each of its courses, regardless of discipline or subject matter.

In addition to academics, Honors students engage in extracurricular events and activities that foster leadership and community engagement.
