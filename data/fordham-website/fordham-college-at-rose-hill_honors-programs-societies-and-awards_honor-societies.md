Honor societies are organizations for students of high academic achievement and are intended to bring together like-minded individuals with high scholastic standards and similar interests.

Many honor societies invite students to become members based on scholastic rank and grade point averages, either overall, or for classes taken within the discipline for which the honor society provides recognition. In cases where academic achievement is not an exclusively appropriate criterion for membership, it is common for honor societies to add a criterion relating to the character of the student.

Some honor societies are joined by invitation only, while others allow unsolicited applications. Contact each honor society for specifics on membership requirements.
