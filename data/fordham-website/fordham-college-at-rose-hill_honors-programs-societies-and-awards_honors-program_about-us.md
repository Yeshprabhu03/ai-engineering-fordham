# About the Rose Hill Honors Program

![Rose Hill Honors Programs](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/RoseHillHonors_02.jpg)

Since its founding in 1950, the Fordham College at Rose Hill Honors Program has provided exceptional students with the opportunity to pursue their core studies in greater depth, breadth, and intensity. Drawn from every major, Honors students share a passion not just for learning, but for thinking about what they learn. They are drawn to our mission of building a community of scholars for justice.

In small, seminar-style classes, Honors professors foster lively discussions, provoke critical analysis of texts and ideas, and provide students with an ideal opportunity to grow personally and intellectually.

"Here's my favorite Honors story: It's the second day of the semester, and the 12 students enrolled in my class have just read The Tempest in preparation for the day's discussion. We all sit down around the seminar table. I open by saying, 'So, The Tempest.' And 12 students immediately raise their hands. That's Honors at Rose Hill: Engaged students, eager to get at it. And professors in love with their work."

- Eve Keller, Ph.D. Professor of English, Honors Program Director
