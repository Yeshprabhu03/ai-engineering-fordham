# Rose Hill Honors Program Student Activities Council

I enjoyed my experience in SAC so much because students are able to be actively involved in choosing and planning the kinds of events that we want most to take part in. Through SAC, our ideas for making the program the best it can be are realized.

Through the Student Activities Council (SAC), Honors students give shape to the program of which they are a part. Students join, lead, and even create new committees, working with the director and program administrator to develop programming that matters to them.
