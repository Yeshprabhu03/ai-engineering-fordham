Before school begins, each first-year student is assigned an upper-level student mentor in the program. Students meet their peer mentors in person at our annual Mentorship Reception in early September, when they join multi-year mentor families of Honors students across all four years.

Students are matched based on intended major, high school, hometown, and extracurricular interests. Student mentors provide information, offer advice, and help first-year students navigate their way through the program and the college.

The Honors Student Mentorship Program …

- gives new students the chance to get the inside scoop on their professors and intended majors from an experienced peer
- helps Honors students from different years to get to know each other
- fosters long-lasting relationships between students through Honors-sponsored events, starting virtually over the summer and in-person at the kickoff Mentorship Reception in September
