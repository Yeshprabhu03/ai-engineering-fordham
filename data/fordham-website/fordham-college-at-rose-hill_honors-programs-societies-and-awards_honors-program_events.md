## Rose Hill Honors Events Calendar

### Fall

**Van Cortlandt Park Scavenger Hunt**

This Honors orientation event takes place the first weekend after classes start for first- year students to bond with their new cohort. Honors upperclassmen take first years to Van Cortlandt Park for a morning scavenger hunt, where students learn about Bronx history and explore the third largest park in NYC, often ending with a slice of cake at the infamous Llyod’s Carrot Cake Shop.

**Ramily Sunday**

The last of the Honors Orientation events, Ramily Sunday, is a chance for first years to meet their sophomore mentors and their entire mentor family. Students are introduced to SAC and other Honors-specific opportunities and curriculum details, and the day ends with lunch, where the new cohort meets the rest of the Honors community.

**Fall Fest**

This event takes place mid-semester in the fall and serves as a chance to unwind from midterm stress with food and friends. Professors and alumni are invited to attend this event, and connections, both new and old, are often kindled over pie and yard games.

**Honors Holiday Party**

An annual tradition to close out the fall semester, the Honors holiday party is a time for students and faculty to celebrate the spirit of the season with local Bronx treats and hot chocolate. Crafts, cookie decorating competitions, and holiday movies are often enjoyed at this party.

### Spring

**Honors Last Lecture**

Honors seniors choose a faculty member they deem to have been most influential in their Honors experience. In the spring, that faculty member gives the lecture they would give if it were their last university lecture ever. Alumni are also invited to attend the Honors Last Lecture. This event is usually held in late March or early April.
