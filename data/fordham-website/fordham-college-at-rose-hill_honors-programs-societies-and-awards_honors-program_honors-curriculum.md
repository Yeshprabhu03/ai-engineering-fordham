## A Community of Scholars for Justice

![Fall Fountain with Female Student](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/Fall_Fountain_Girl_Med.jpg)

The mission of the Fordham College at Rose Hill Honors Program is to produce and promote a community of scholars for justice. We achieve our mission through a curriculum that in some substantive way focuses on the concerns of diversity and justice in each of its courses, regardless of discipline or subject matter. In addition to academics, Honors students engage in extracurricular events and activities that foster leadership and community engagement. Learn more about the [Honors community](/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/honors-programs-societies-and-awards/honors-program/community/) and unique Honors opportunities.

"The themes we engage within Honors classes stretch into the social, political, and economic climates we find ourselves in today. This focus on the liberal arts has contributed to my personal activism, both at Fordham and beyond."

*Note: This curriculum is in effect for students entering in fall 2019 and beyond. Students entering in fall 2018 or earlier follow a different curriculum.*

The Honors curriculum takes the place of the regular Fordham College at Rose Hill core curriculum, with the exception of the language requirement. AP and IB courses can earn students college credit toward graduation; they do not, however, replace any courses in the Honors Program. Most students enter the program at the beginning of their first year, though occasionally it is possible for a few students with strong academic records to join after the first or second semester.

Members of the program are expected to maintain a grade point average of 3.5 or above. Successful completion of the program entitles the student to the designation *in **cursu* *honorum* on their diploma and transcript.

At Fordham College Rose Hill, students take five courses each semester in the first two years and four courses each semester in junior and senior year. With the Honors curriculum, our students take a sequence of foundational and focused study courses alongside their major courses, electives, and language requirement to complete a full schedule.
