The first year of the Honors Program offers an integrated study of foundational texts and topics in diverse Western intellectual and cultural traditions, including theology and classics, literature, philosophy, history, art, and music. The first-year curriculum also includes a two-semester interdisciplinary STEM sequence and a one-credit seminar focused on our home borough called Bronx Exploration: History, Economy, Culture.
