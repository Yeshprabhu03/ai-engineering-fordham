# FCRH Honors Program Undergraduate Research

Honors students excel in undergraduate research across all disciplines. From Biological Sciences and Integrative Neuroscience to History and Political Science, our students have presented their research at undergraduate symposiums and national conferences.

## Honors Program Opportunities

### Ambassadorial Grants

The FCRH Honors Program offers a limited number of grants, up to $500 each, for Honors students presenting their research at national conferences or engaging in creative projects. The grantees act as ambassadors for both the FCRH Honors Program and for Fordham College at Rose Hill as they advance scholarship in their discipline and showcase their research potential. For further information, please contact us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9ff7f0f1f0edecefedf0f8edf7dff9f0edfbf7fef2b1fafbea).

### FCRH Research Grants

Fordham Rose Hill College offers a variety of competitive research grants for all undergraduate students, including travel grants for presenting at conferences and research grants for conducting original research. Many Honors students are awarded the Summer Research Grants, providing an opportunity for students to pursue on-campus research. For details, please visit the [Research Opportunities](/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/undergraduate-research-and-internships/research-opportunities-and-support/) page.

### FCRH Undergraduate Research Symposium

This event takes place at the end of the spring semester and celebrates original research in all fields. Students submit an abstract to present their work. Either in poster or oral format, this symposium allows students to present their research to the Fordham community. For guidelines, visit the [Undergraduate Research Symposium](/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/undergraduate-research-and-internships/undergraduate-research-symposium/).

### Fordham Undergraduate Research Journal (FURJ)

FURJ is a student-run journal that features high-quality, peer-reviewed, original research conducted by undergraduate students. The journal is published annually—in print and online—in the spring semester. It is an interdisciplinary journal, accepting submissions in the arts, humanities, social sciences and STEM. For submission guidelines, visit the [FURJ website](https://tfurj.com/submission-%20guidelines/).

### National Conference on Undergraduate Research

The National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR) is dedicated to promoting undergraduate research, scholarship, and creative activity in all fields of study by sponsoring an annual conference for students. Usually, the call for abstracts is issued in September, and the conference is held at an institution of higher learning in April. For details, visit the [NCUR website](https://www.cur.org/events-services/ncur/).

**Hannah Darnell** (FCRH ‘26, Sociology) curated an exhibit about a Puerto Rican lacemaking process called *mundillo* at the NYPL **Bronx Library Center’s Latinx and Puerto Rican Heritage Center**. This collection of photographs, interview excerpts, and lace products was sourced during an ethnographic research trip Hannah completed last summer in the San Juan and Moca areas of Puerto Rico. This exhibition, *Little World*, honors the work and perspectives of the lace artisans she interviewed while in Puerto Rico, uniting bilingual text and visual art in a private room inside the library.

**Amy Herd** (FCRH ’25, International Studies and History) made an oral presentation, titled “Dumy and the Nation: How Folk Songs Helped Compose a Distinct Ukrainian Narrative,” at the **National Conference on Undergraduate Research**, held at the University of Pittsburgh in April 2025. Specifically, Amy’s project explores the resurgence of the popularity of folk songs in light of Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, illustrating how folk music has taken on new life in Ukraine and the Ukrainian diaspora. For a description of her research, read the [Dumy and the Nation article](https://ncur.secure-platform.com/2025/gallery/rounds/30/details/28604).

**Alexander Kim** (FCRH’26, English) participated in a poster session and presented his work on framing and counterframing economic policy in the Republic of Ireland at the 2025 **annual meeting of the Midwest Political Science Association** in Chicago. This study contributes to comparative politics literature by demonstrating the significance of framing in shaping policy outcomes and affecting the capacity of social movements to campaign for poverty reduction.

**Sarah Rancic **(FCRH ’25, Integrative Neuroscience) presented her research on the molecular determinants of clamp binding in *Bacillus subtilis*at the 2025 Spring Conference of the American Chemical Society in San Diego. Her research provides insight into mechanisms related to a novel class of antibiotic drugs, known as DnaN inhibitors, which can be used to combat the rising prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
