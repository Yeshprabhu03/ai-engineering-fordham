Scholarships may be limited to:

- Activities or

- Talent or specific skills
- Financial need

Please read the descriptions carefully for all requirements and contact the program providing the scholarship with specific questions.

The terms "scholarship" and "fellowship" are often used interchangeably to describe a grant or another type of funding for academic achievement.

Any funds awarded from organizations other than Fordham University are typically referred to as "outside scholarships." Scholarships usually do not need to be repaid.

In addition to Fordham-administered merit-based scholarships, FCRH students are also eligible for these scholarships.
