The **FCRH STEM Honors Program** is a selective, research-intensive academic experience for outstanding undergraduate students majoring in the sciences, mathematics, and computer science. Rooted in Fordham’s Jesuit tradition, the program combines rigorous STEM training with Fordham’s liberal arts core curriculum, close faculty mentorship, and early engagement in research—using New York City as an extended classroom.

## Who are our students?

Launching in the 2026-2027 academic year, the STEM Honors Program is designed for students who:

- Are excited by scientific discovery and interdisciplinary problem-solving
- Want early access to faculty-mentored research
- Are curious about how science intersects with ethics, society, and innovation

**Note:** The program’s strong emphasis on research makes it an excellent fit for research-oriented students, while it may be less aligned with a purely pre-health–focused curriculum.

## Curriculum

- Honors-designated lecture and laboratory sections in multiple introductory STEM disciplines, encouraging both depth in a chosen major and breadth across fields. These honors sections focus on problem solving, interdisciplinary connections, and research-based skills beyond the typical coursework.
- Honors seminars focusing on: scientific writing and public communication; data analytics and visualization; ethics and the business of science; graduate school, fellowships, and career preparation
- Completion of a major in Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Computer Science, Environmental Science, Mathematics, Neuroscience, or Physics
- Upper-level interdisciplinary course outside their major
- Capstone research project / thesis
- Fordham’s holistic liberal arts core curriculum in the humanities, social sciences, philosophy, and theology

## Community

- Individual faculty mentors (distinct from research advisors)
- Funded summer research internship at Fordham, and support for identifying internships at external community partners in NYC
- A community of like-minded scholars-in-training
- Student-led social and academic events
