# Internal Transfer

## Policies and Procedures

-
Acceptance of courses toward the requirements of the new college/major are contingent upon the approval of the department chairperson of the new college. Your Academic Advisor will assist you with this process.

All previously graded Fordham coursework remains calculated into the student's GPA and earned credits.

Once an internal transfer has been approved, the student is a student of the new college. All remaining core and major courses must meet the requirements of the new college.

The recommended internal transfer application deadline for the spring semester is December 15th.

The recommended deadline for the fall semester is May 15.

If internally transferring to or from Fordham School of Professional and Continuing Studies (PCS), be advised that tuition is billed differently than at FCRH, FCLC, and GABELLI. Students should contact 718-817-3800 with tuition questions.

-
First, you should schedule a meeting with your Academic Advisor to discuss a possible transfer. Upon approval, you fill out an

[internal transfer application](https://www.fordham.edu/my-pages/students/electronic-forms/).Next, you receive an email to make an appointment with a new Academic Advisor at your requested campus to discuss your academic schedule for the upcoming semester.

**If you are seeking transfer admission to the Gabelli School of Business, the process is slightly different:**- You must first attend a required internal transfer information session, hosted by Dean Megan Decker (
[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a2cfc6c7c1c9c7d09393e2c4cdd0c6cac3cf8cc7c6d7)).

Fall sessions will be held on Thursdays at 1 p.m. from mid-October through mid-November;

Spring sessions will be held mid-February through mid-March. - After the session, meet with your current academic advisor to discuss your interest in transferring.
