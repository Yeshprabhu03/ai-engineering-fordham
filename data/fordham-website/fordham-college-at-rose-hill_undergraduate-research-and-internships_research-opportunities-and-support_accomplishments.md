# FCRH Undergraduate Research Accomplishments

### Students for Others: Cura Personalis Drives Fordham's Successful Reopening

In fall 2020, Fordham reopened and our students kept the campus safe with their incredible adherence to recommended health behaviors. Students in our pediatric psychology and health behaviors lab had a feeling this had everything to do with cura personalis and they set out to test this in a study that was published in the [Journal of American College Health](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07448481.2022.2095514) and featured in the [Fordham News](https://news.fordham.edu/university-news/students-for-others-helped-contain-covid-at-fordham/) as well.

### Dissemination Near and Far

Our students are published scholars and global presenters! Each year, dozens of FCRH students present at national and even international venues. Pictured are Brigid Cruser (FCRH '19) and Isabel Velarde (FCRH '21) presented their work at the UNIV Congress in Rome. Their project was mentored by the late, beloved Father Joseph Koterski.

### The Fordham Undergraduate Research Journal turned 10!

In spring 2020, showing that the pandemic couldn't slow it down, our FURJ team completed their 10th edition, available [here](https://tfurj.com/), along with the most recent editions.

### Research that Influences Policy

In 2018, a FCRH student, Natalie Wodniak (FCRH '18), was one of only 60 students in the country selected to present at the CUR Posters on the Hill event where she shared her research with congress and her hometown congressman.
