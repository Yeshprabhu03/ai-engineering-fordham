FURJ is an interdisciplinary journal, accepting submissions conducted by undergraduate students in the arts, humanities, social sciences and STEM. Submissions are welcome from current Fordham students and recent graduates as well as students from other universities who conducted research at Fordham.

The journal also includes scholarly book reviews, review essays, and feature articles. All research articles undergo a rigorous double-blind peer and faculty mentor approval process.
