Getting a college degree is a feat that requires focus, resilience, and time-management skills. Doing so while being a parent takes next-level compartmentalizing. For those graduates, the annual commencement ceremony is not only their moment but a time to celebrate the people who inspired them and “whose support made this day possible,” said Fordham President Tania Tetlow—whose own father [earned his Ph.D. from the University when she was a young child](https://now.fordham.edu/fordham-magazine/introducing-tania-tetlow-33-things-to-know-about-fordhams-history-making-new-president/#three).

We caught up with several grads who told us about their communities of support and what their Fordham education means to them and their families.

“There were many challenges, mostly balancing being present with getting the necessary work done. I chose a remote program so I could have flexibility, but even that proved difficult. I made it work by letting go of perfection, asking for help, and remembering that rest is part of resistance.

“My kids didn’t just watch me write this dissertation—they lived it with me. My youngest especially started with me on this when he just turned 3, and so most of my classes were with him on my lap. I didn’t have time to waste, so I made it count. It also reminded me why this work matters, because our kids are watching, and because systems need to change for them. That kept me focused. My entire dissertation is on equity-driven math practices. This work matters and my kids know it!”

Children: Micah, 14; Ella-Mae, 10; Evangeline, 9 months

“My spouse, mother, sisters, and friends stepped in to make sure my home was functioning, and I got really good at delegating and saying no at work. I also had to get better at prioritizing what matters most and not necessarily what screamed the loudest. I had to make peace with what I couldn’t do and find the best ways to move us all forward each day.

“I’d like to thank Dr. Margaret Terry Orr for being such a supportive mentor. I had my third child last year and just hearing her say that the program would accommodate my needs regardless of how I decided to move forward was huge to me. She was patient and direct, which is what I needed in order to finish this.

“I’d also like to thank my ‘write sis’ crew, members of my cohort that I met with regularly to give advice, help revise, and vent with through the dissertation writing period. I could not have done it without their support.”

[B.A. in Social Work](https://www.fordham.edu/school-of-professional-and-continuing-studies/academics/undergraduate-degree-programs/social-work/)

Children: Keaton, 7; Jayce, 2; Sutton, 8 months

“I had my two youngest kids while I was in college. It’s a lot of work juggling, between work, family—being a father, being a husband—and trying to be a student on top of it. Having my family and support behind me was really what kept me going. There was a lot of pushing through barriers that I honestly didn’t think I could do mentally. Going into the service [as a Military Police soldier in the Army] was one thing, because that was the physical aspect. But I never thought in a million years I’d walk across the stage to get my degree. The flexibility I was able to have by taking my courses at night was great, and having the G.I. Bill help pay and provide for me to go to school was such a benefit.

“My wife just got her bachelor’s two weeks ago. Every single night, she stayed up after taking care of our kids all day when I was at my internship and at work. The kids would go to bed, and she’d get right to her school work. I could not have gotten to where I’m at without her.”

[Ph.D. in Theology](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/departments/theology/prospective-graduate-students/phd-in-theology/)

Children: Ivan, 16; Evelyn, 4

“My kids have been an incredible source of inspiration for finishing the doctorate. As an Eastern Orthodox Christian, [I want them to] see me using my gifts to help the church [and to] know that being faithful sometimes means challenging traditions, practices, and entrenched biases.

“A large part of what has made this degree possible is my husband, Ben, who was three years ahead of me in the grad school process and so understood the particular demands. I would not have been able to write this dissertation without his love and support.”

Child: Camryn, 3

“Being a parent, student, and teacher is all extremely rewarding. My daughter is the reason I was able to stay sane throughout the entire process. She got me through the hardest times while I was studying. Providing her with positive experiences I never had is my motivation.

“Also, motherhood has given me more perspective as a student. I applied much of my classroom knowledge to parenting, especially Kevin Spinale’s literacy course. I’m a first-generation college student, so I already defied odds for my immediate family, but it also feels so good because it has increased my self-awareness and confidence. I know I can accomplish anything I put my mind to.”

“It’s been a lot of work—going to class while being pregnant—but it’s been really rewarding. It’s a huge moment, so I wanted to make sure everyone was here to celebrate. My mom has helped while I’ve been finishing assignments, and my husband has been my number one supporter.”

Child: Lilly, 15

“Balancing doctoral studies and parenting has been incredibly difficult. A year ago, I lost my husband, which forced me to pause my dissertation to grieve and restructure life with my daughter. She was transitioning from middle to high school while we faced immense emotional and financial hardship. We lost not only a husband and father but also income and housing stability.

“The support from Fordham, especially from Dr. Fuhua Zhai and Dr. Larry Farmer, and the parent network at my daughter’s school made a significant difference. My dissertation examines social support and self-efficacy in relation to depression among low-income women in Vietnam. I applied those very principles in my own life, seeking emotional, informational, and tangible support from close friends.”

Children: Christopher, 24; Christina, 22; Victoria, 13

“It’s been a little challenging since I have a younger one who’s still in middle school. My husband has been my main support. To me, this demonstrates to my children that no matter the struggles, the challenges, if you put your energy into it and you’re really motivated, you can do whatever you want.”

Child: Lidia, 2

“I took off six days between giving birth and coming back to teaching. As part of my dissertation, I was writing about [Lamentations](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/lamentations/0), and there’s imagery of mothers, so being a new mother really changed my perspective and impacted my writing. Also, having a child, you want to make the world a better place. I’m dealing with ancient texts, but at the same time, it was really important for me to find things in my work that were relevant to today. She keeps me forward-looking.” *(Photo provided by subject)*

B.A. in [Economics](https://www.fordham.edu/school-of-professional-and-continuing-studies/academics/undergraduate-degree-programs/economics/) and [Organizational Leadership](https://www.fordham.edu/school-of-professional-and-continuing-studies/academics/undergraduate-degree-programs/organizational-leadership/)

Child: Lucas, 16

“Between working full time, being a mom, and going to school, I’ve had to juggle a lot. I don’t have family around to help, but I’ve been lucky to have an amazing husband and great friends who supported me every step of the way. I also learned that I needed to be patient and kind with myself—some days were messy, and that’s okay. My son and I sometimes did homework together, which helped us both stay motivated.

“This isn’t just my achievement—it’s for my parents, who passed away recently and sacrificed so much for me. It’s for my husband and son, who have been my biggest cheerleaders. And for all the friends and professors who believed in me.”

[M.S. in Construction Management](https://www.fordham.edu/school-of-professional-and-continuing-studies/academics/real-estate-institute/academics/graduate-programs/master-of-science-in-construction-management/)

Children: Amari, 10; Zuri, 4

“It’s been juggling a lot of roles. It was definitely different than undergraduate, which was 26 years ago. I’ve also been working—I work for Tishman Speyer at Rockefeller Center. At my job, I see a lot of construction and building happening, so it’s exciting to get into that and start managing some projects. I can set an example for my kids while they’re young—work hard and you can accomplish anything. You just try to instill education in them early. My son is really into architecture now. It feels great to have them here at my graduation.”
