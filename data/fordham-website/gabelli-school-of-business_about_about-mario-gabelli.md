**A Commitment to Philanthropy and Education**

Gabelli serves on the boards of Boston College, Roger Williams University, Columbia Graduate School of Business, the American-Italian Cancer Foundation, and the Foundation for Italian Art & Culture. He is a trustee of the Winston Churchill Foundation of the United States and of the E.L. Wiegand Foundation, and is a member of the Fordham University President’s Council.

**The Birth of the Gabelli School of Business**

In addition to his passion for investing, Gabelli holds an inviolate belief in education as the great equalizer, the heart and soul of the great American experiment.** It is this belief that inspired his transformative 2010 and 2020 gifts to Fordham University, the largest in the University’s history, gifts that revolutionized business education at Fordham. ** Gabelli also funded the Gabelli School Ph.D. program, which welcomed its first students in fall 2016.

In gratitude, the University renamed the undergraduate business college the Gabelli School of Business in 2010; five years later, the undergraduate and graduate business schools were unified under the Gabelli name. Gabelli's generosity, coupled with his work on the President’s Council, positions Fordham at the forefront in today’s business world.

Education is the great leveler, the engine of America’s meritocracy, and it must remain so for the country to compete in the global economy.
