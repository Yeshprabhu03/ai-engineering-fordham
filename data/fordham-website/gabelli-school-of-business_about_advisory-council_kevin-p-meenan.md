Kevin P. Meenan has been the founder and CEO (chief empowerment officer) for CityDroneZ since January 2017.

Meenan has over 43 years of experience leveraging technology to process data, including over 37 years on Wall Street, mainly focused on the credit markets, including mortgages, syndicated loans, and consumer assets.

He was also a founder of two other startups, Meenan, McDevitt, and Compufit—both sold after 7-10 years at a significant profit.

CityDroneZ captures geographic information systems (GIS) data using drones equipped with various types of sensors to inspect real estate and infrastructure assets. This raw data is then processed into valuable information for our clients. In some instances, we can create virtual “Digital Twins” of assets in GIS databases. CityDroneZ also intends to deliver medical packages using drones with its DroneMDSM business in Westchester County as our first target market.

Meenan also serves as a board member for his alma mater, Cardinal Hayes High School, which is located in the Bronx. In 2000, he was inducted into their Hall of Fame.

Meenan and his wife, Marianne, both grew up in the Bronx and came from families of five siblings. Meenan attended Fordham College at Rose Hill, earning a B.A. in medieval studies and an M.B.A. from Fordham (Lincoln Center) at night.

The couple was thrilled to marry at the Rose Hill Chapel in June 1981 and then visited The New York Botanical Gardens across the street for some of their wedding photos.

Their three sons were born and raised in Chappaqua, New York, before they all attended Boston College, where two of them met their wives. One son was wise to earn his M.B.A. from Fordham Lincoln Center.

Kevin has proudly served on the Fordham University Gabelli School of Business Advisory Council for 15 years.
