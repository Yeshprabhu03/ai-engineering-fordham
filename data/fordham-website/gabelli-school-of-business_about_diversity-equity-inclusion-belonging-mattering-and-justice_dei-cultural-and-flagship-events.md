# DEI Cultural and Flagship Events

![GSB-DEI Event Calendar](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/gsb_dei_students_events2.jpg)


The Gabelli School DEI Board provides inclusive industry and cultural programming throughout the academic school year. In the fall, we focus mainly on recruiting and speaker events to introduce students to various professional careers such as accounting, finance, and consulting. In the spring, our focus shifts toward speaker panels and fireside chats with industry professionals during cultural months.

**Finance Diversity & Inclusion Night**

Finance Diversity & Inclusion Night is the DEI Board’s annual fall capstone event. This application-only event takes place at Fordham’s Lincoln Center Campus, and it is an opportunity for diverse undergraduate students to meet and speak with Fordham alumni and employers within the fields of finance and accounting. Traditionally, it begins with a young alumni panel and is followed by a networking session where refreshments are served.

Notable alumni and employers who have attended have come from firms such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citi, Credit Suisse, PwC, EY, KPMG, Mizuho, Deutsche Bank, and TD Bank.

**Black History Month Fireside Chat**

Black History Month is a time to celebrate the achievements of notable African American Gabelli alumni or staff and invite them to discuss their experiences within the corporate world. Typically hosted as a fireside chat with the Dean, this BHM event focuses on shedding light on the experiences of alumni and staff at the Gabelli School, their career journeys, and what BHM means to them.

**Women’s History Month Podcast and Blog**

Women’s History Month is a time to highlight the experiences of the Gabelli School’s female students, alumni, and staff and learn from their successes in various fields of business. During WHM, the DEI Board typically hosts an alumni panel and produces podcasts that feature both graduate and undergraduate students. From these, students can learn about different career paths and experiences while also hearing about women’s initiatives in the workplace.

**Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month**

While Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month is typically celebrated in May, relevant programming occurs in April, as Pride Month programming occurs a month early as well. The DEI Board collaborates with and supports the programming efforts of cultural affinity groups on campus such as ASCEND, the Asian Cultural Exchange, and the AAPI Committee under the Office of Multicultural Affairs.

**Pride Month Event**

The DEI Board typically collaborates with the LGBTQIA+ organizations and OMA on campus to help plan or promote their events, which are hosted a month before June as the semester ends in May. It is a time to celebrate queer representation within the Fordham community and to highlight the impact of those present at the Stonewall Riots many years ago.

**Achievement in Belonging Awards Ceremony**

The Gabelli School is proud to host the annual Belonging Awards Ceremony where we celebrate the achievements of the entire Gabelli School community in diversity, equity and inclusion. Everyone in the Gabelli School community is hard at work upholding our Jesuit principles and Ignatian values, so every year our community members nominate alumni, students, faculty, staff, corporate and community partners, and University stakeholders to acknowledge their commitment to our mission.

**Hispanic/Latinx Heritage Month**

The Gabelli School and the DEI Board celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month to recognize the achievements and contributions of Latinx American champions who have inspired others to achieve success. Please join our community during this time of celebration to honor the richness of Latin culture, and the vast achievements of Latinx professionals in business and in all fields of human endeavor.

**CCP Final Showcase**

The CCP Final Showcase is the Gabelli School's flagship event for our high school pipeline program. This pitch proposal scholarship competition highlights the CCP Program's capstone project concerning the DEI output of Fortune 500 companies and potential equity solutions. Many of the high school seniors in the program will join us as college freshmen in the fall.
