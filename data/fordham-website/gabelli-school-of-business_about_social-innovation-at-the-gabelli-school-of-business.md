# Social Innovation at the Gabelli School of Business

Around the world, expectations are rising.

Young people are demanding that governments and businesses act now to slow the warming of the planet. The wealth inequality gap is becoming impossible to ignore. Consumers want to patronize businesses that make products of value *and* contribute to society. CEOs worldwide are calling to redefine the purpose of a corporation.

There is a pressing need to inspire and equip future leaders with the values and vision to help business move society forward. This is what the Gabelli School of Business offers uniquely to the world.

Why the Gabelli School of Business?

While social innovation—applying creative, practical, sustainable, business approaches to solve social and environmental problems, especially to benefit vulnerable or marginalized populations—is a relatively new focus for many corporations and business schools, it has been a special focus of intellectual investment at the Gabelli School for many years.

This values-driven head start at Fordham has afforded us the opportunity to build a comprehensive platform to incubate social innovation. This infrastructure features a group of experts who hold the title of Gabelli Fellows. It includes a global network of social entrepreneurs and business innovators that connects almost every key actor in the sector. It encompasses courses for undergraduate and graduate students, and it houses a Social Innovation Collaboratory where passionate individuals can workshop and execute their ideas while benefitting from the wisdom of their peers, expertise of faculty and local business advisors.

The Gabelli School has built the strong foundation required to converge cutting edge research and professional practice that will allow companies, social sector organizations, and nations to rise to the level of the world’s expectations.

Social Innovation is for Everyone

We at the Gabelli School are, first and foremost, global educators. We seek to develop the mindsets and capabilities in the next generation of business leaders who instinctively wake up every morning wondering how they can do better for those around them.

Some of our students do this by becoming **social entrepreneurs**: people who start new businesses that are grounded in the mission of advancing society. Social entrepreneurs develop products and services that meet market demand, but they do so in ways that bring about broad positive outcomes and address pressing social issues.

We recognize, however, that many young people will get involved with business in ways outside entrepreneurship. So, in addition to supporting our socially-minded entrepreneurs, we teach **social innovation and intrapreneurship**: the idea that any business in any sector can be infused with values-driven impact – embodying the principles and mastering the tools and approaches that yield benefits for all.

Our Network Model

What we are talking about here is large-scale, systems-level change—something that no business, government, or organization can accomplish alone.

The Gabelli School leads in social innovation by linking three groups that play a crucial role in answering today’s global challenges: **academics**, who conduct research that serves as a cornerstone for social awareness, meaningful discussion, and deliberate action; **practitioners**, the businesses and government leaders who put socially innovative methods into action; and **students**, whose energy and new ideas are defining the direction of social innovation sooner and faster than many realize.
