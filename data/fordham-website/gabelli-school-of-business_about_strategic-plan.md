On behalf of the Strategic Planning Steering Group and Project Team, it is my pleasure to share our [ Strategic Plan: Shaping Our Future and Embracing Change](https://digital.gabelli.fordham.edu/initiatives/).

As part of the comprehensive strategic planning process, and throughout the many stakeholder engagements we conducted in 2024, we listened to and incorporated ideas from faculty, staff, administrators, advisory board members, alumni, learners, and industry partners.

It’s clear that, collectively, we have bold and courageous ambitions for the future of the Gabelli School of Business. While our commitment to our Jesuit values and responsible business leadership remains unchanged, it is apparent that we are at a pivotal turning point in our history—one that requires us to implement transformational changes to meet the needs of the learners we serve, the University we call home, and our community, while addressing seismic shifts in the marketplace and in society at large.

As the Jesuit business school of New York City, we are called upon to seize this moment and use it to propel the School forward. Through our work together during the past year, we have come to realize how essential it is to boldly innovate our educational content and delivery, while exploring new business models. As we strive to become increasingly agile and adaptable, we also will focus on improving educational access, enhancing institutional sustainability, and amplifying our impact. In alignment with Fordham University’s Strategic Plan, we will continue to cultivate transformative Jesuit education, while building communities of belonging, and forging local, national, and global partnerships—all critical to ensuring our success.

As we implement the School’s Strategic Plan, we will incorporate new ideas while expanding upon decades of growth, innovation, and success. We will be living our deeply rooted Jesuit values while embracing the future and all that is to come. We will welcome change with the courage, commitment, and conviction that is the hallmark of the transformational Gabelli School of Business education we provide.
