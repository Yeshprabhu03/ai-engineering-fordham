# Why the Gabelli School?

## Three Ways we Stand Apart

### Jesuit Education

The Gabelli School is part of a distinct network of Jesuit educational institutions around the world that educate the *whole *person – mind, body, and soul – and prepare students to create a more just, humane, and sustainable world. Jesuit schools welcome students of all faiths and cultures and embrace a humanistic, interdisciplinary approach to gaining knowledge. But what you do with that knowledge is just as important. At the Gabelli School, students are encouraged to grow personally and spiritually, to test their values, and develop a sense of responsibility for themselves and their community while making ethical choices both in their lives and in their careers.

### Social Innovation

As a flagship institution for responsible business strategy, the Gabelli School integrates business connections, environmental, social and governance (ESG) research, and curricula to develop leaders who are change agents and critical thinkers willing to take responsible action for the greater good.

Social innovation – applying creative, practical, sustainable business approaches to solve social and environmental problems, especially to benefit vulnerable or marginalized populations – is deeply woven into the fabric of the Gabelli School experience, whether students drive social good as a direct career path or utilize a mindset that helps them recognize the potential for business to serve societal needs. As both an Ashoka Changemaker Campus and champion institution in the U.N.’s Principles of Responsible Management Education initiative, our network extends to other global institutions and thought leaders who are on the forefront of using business, education, and technology to meet the needs of humanity.

### Industry Connectivity

You’ll gain insight into business fields long before your first internship. At the Gabelli School, renowned faculty experts, a curriculum that continually anticipates the needs of tomorrow’s businesses, and an alumni network with uncommonly loyal bonds combine to make industry connectivity a key part of the Gabelli School’s DNA. Dynamic partnerships with companies such as EY, PVH Corp., the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, and many others internationally enrich the classroom experience. Access to events that feature global thought leaders at the highest levels of business will give you a 360-degree view of the marketplace.
