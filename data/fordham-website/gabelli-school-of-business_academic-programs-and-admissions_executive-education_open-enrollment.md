Keeping current with changing industry practices is crucial in business. Fordham offers open-enrollment executive programs to meet that need.

We provide a maximum amount of knowledge with minimum time investment. Programs typically run from two to five days.

Current and recent open-enrollment programs include:

Finance and Accounting

** Corporate Compliance Institute**

The Gabelli School of Business Summer Compliance Institute offers a one-week intensive training on the fundamentals of an effective Compliance Function within financial services firms, the evolving role and skill sets of the compliance officer, and the interconnectivity between compliance, risk, governance and other lines of defense.

** ESG Courses**

Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns are becoming part of mainstream business discussions. They require that companies consider more than just profit but create value for all stakeholders, including society. Our ESG courses curriculum is available in several formats and is eligible for CPE credit to help professionals navigate the ESG landscape.

** M&A Dealmaking Course**

Middle-market companies may not sound as exciting as the biggest firms that bring in billions at a time or the flashy startups that thrill and awe, but the strength of the overall economy depends on the health of the middle market. It’s also where you can find great deals.

General Management

** Developing and Implementing a Sustainable Business Plan**

This eight-week course looks at the key ethical, economic, and scientific principles needed to manage “triple bottom line” enterprises. Participants learn to manage for the planet, people, profit and longevity simultaneously, and the program culminates in a personalized, actionable strategic plan for your organization – big or small.

** Fordham Leadership Accelerator**

Leadership is defined by an unrelenting commitment to improvement and change—which is why leaders in any organization or business field can benefit from the Fordham Leadership Accelerator.
