# M&A Dealmaking

## Understanding the Private Equity Middle-Market Ecosystem

Middle-market companies may not sound as exciting as the biggest firms that bring in billions at a time or the flashy startups that thrill and awe.

But the strength of the overall economy depends on the health of the middle market.

It’s also where you can find great deals.

Offered in partnership with the Association for Corporate Growth (ACG New York), this eight-week course immerses ACG New York members and non-members alike into the middle-market ecosystem and operating dynamics of middle-market companies.

Up-and-coming M&A dealmakers will learn the skills and knowledge needed to navigate the middle market with ease and make the most of this growing world.
