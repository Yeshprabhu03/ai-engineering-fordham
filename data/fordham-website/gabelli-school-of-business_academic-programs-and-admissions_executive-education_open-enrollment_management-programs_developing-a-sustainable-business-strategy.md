Focus on the Bottom Line

*Westchester County Association & Gabelli School of Business Partnership*

**Upcoming Dates: **November 8-10, 2023**Location: **Online

We will look at the key ethical, economic, and scientific principles needed to manage “triple bottom line” enterprises: entities that are both profitable and responsible (socially and environmentally).

Participants learn to manage for the planet, people, profit and longevity simultaneously.

The main questions we will explore are:

- How can businesses large and small cope with the environmental and social challenges to “business as usual?”
- How can profitable and viable businesses protect the environment and reduce social injustice while dissipating society’s trust and confidence in private enterprise?

We will use as a backdrop the latest admonition by Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, to repurpose business and produce long term value for society. Participants will analyze a company of their choice in terms of its future viability and in turn develop strategies and product/service innovations that can help the company to succeed in a sustainability oriented world.

Program includes 8 weeks of mixed live classes and recorded lessons, cases, and exercises. Class will formally come together three times during the course (beginning, middle, and end) for 90-minute classes.

The program culminates in a personalized, actionable strategic plan for your organization big or small.
