Fordham has a reputation for excellence. I wanted to go to a school where many of the professors have practical business experience that can be applied to real world situations.

Additionally, the proximity to my job and access to all the city has to offer were clear benefits.

I really enjoyed working with my classmates on case studies and projects. They are some of the smartest and driven people I have come into contact with. We are all like-minded in that we want to learn from others and enhance our skillsets. I found that the cases cultivated creative problem solving that can be readily applied to my business.

**Where are you working now?**

I’m the chief financial officer for National Distribution Alliance.

**Why did you choose the Gabelli School?**

I began my career in an IT and operations role and transitioned to finance later in my career. I felt it was essential to add a finance degree from a top university to my credentials. The Gabelli School’s Executive MBA program gave me the flexibility to handle my responsibilities at work, home, and school. I live in Manhattan, and Lincoln Center is a convenient location to quickly get to and from classes, which allowed me to take additional courses on top of the EMBA program in order to earn a degree in finance.

**Which part of the EMBA program did you find most engaging?**

Apart from honing my skillset at a technical level, we spent a lot of time focusing on strengths and opportunities for improvement in our careers. I learned a lot about myself and used that knowledge to become a better leader and mentor at my company.

**What was the best part of your experience at the Gabelli School overall?**

The people I met throughout the program. Our cohort members all came from different backgrounds, and it was great to learn about them and the successes and challenges they have faced throughout their careers. Also, the professors were always available and willing to share their experiences in their careers to help us understand the course material.

**What's the biggest advantage of the Gabelli School's EMBA program?**

The most significant advantage is the network of alumni throughout New York City. Along with the people I met in my time at the Gabelli School, I have made other contacts that are willing to connect based on our common affiliation to Fordham.

**Where are you working now?**

I am the deputy director and chief operating officer of the Frick Collection museum in New York City. I have been in this position for five years. Prior to my work at the Frick, I was senior manager for strategy and capital projects at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

**Why did you choose the Gabelli School?**

The Executive MBA program at the Gabelli School afforded me the opportunity to earn my MBA while maintaining my career and income. The program offered the general business management program and skills that I needed to advance, and the format was perfect for me as a professional with a full personal and family life.

**Which part of the EMBA program did you find most engaging?**

Courses on topics such as negotiation, which included heavy doses of case studies and collaborative group work, were most impactful to me. Through my negotiation coursework, I began to learn about all that is going on beneath the surface in the world of work and business. I also took tremendous value from the personal analysis of my own strengths and weaknesses. This work gave me a clearer sense of how to apply my skills to the greatest benefit.

**What's the biggest advantage of the Gabelli School's EMBA program?**

As a general manager, the program opened my eyes to the range of expertise that business leaders need to effectively employ. I often find myself using the knowledge I gained at Fordham, but I am also keenly aware that no one can be an expert at everything, and the role of a good manager is to allow each individual to contribute and add as much value as possible.

**Where are you working now?**

I am currently senior vice president of specialty and pharmacy benefit management product leader at CVS Health.

**Why did you choose the Gabelli School?**

The most important reason I chose to go to the Gabelli School was the exceptional educational value of a top-ranked university in New York City, and the flexibility of the Executive MBA program. The curriculum the school offered really appealed to me and aligned with my interest in international business management. In addition, the ability to take weekend classes helped me balance my pursuit of a business management degree with having a family and working full-time.

**Which part of the EMBA program did you find most engaging?**

I found the most engaging aspect of the EMBA program to be the business cases, and the accounting and finance curriculum because they gave me a broader perspective and skills that were valuable in advancing my career.

I was able to build on the foundational learnings at Fordham to continue to expand my skills and experience, going on to expand my role and being promoted to a vice president position abroad, living in the Netherlands and broadly developing and managing pharmaceutical health care programs in the Netherlands, Germany, and the United Kingdom. I also had the privilege to work closely with tremendous colleagues from South America, Europe, Emerging Markets, South Africa, Asia – all built on the competencies I developed based on my education at Fordham.

**What was the best part of your experience at the Gabelli School overall?**

My peers in the Class of 2010 – a great group of colleagues from all over the industry. The program gave me the opportunity to work with and learn from teams with a wide range of expertise and experience in different leadership roles. We also had exceptional professors who brought industry best practices into the classroom. Working in China on our final team project was an incredible capstone to my time at Fordham. My time there helped me build on what I learned about the value of different cultures, hone my skills on creating a business case, and taught me how to manage a new business model.
