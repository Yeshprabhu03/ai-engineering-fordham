The Full-Time MBA consists of a streamlined 60 credits, completed full-time in two years.

Year 1 provides all core business courses up front, giving you an advantage as you interview for internships. Year 2 gives you the freedom to choose courses based on your interests and career goals.

Throughout the Full-Time MBA program, comprehensive self-assessments will help you to:

- Identify strengths and areas for growth
- Choose electives
- Focus your career planning
