# M.B.A. Internships and Job Placements

![MBA Internships](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/gsb_mba_intern.jpg)


Every Full-Time MBA student begins the program with previous work experience. It is a requirement for admission, and it's what makes your Fordham classmates so interesting. Each person contributes to class discussions based on his or her own unique work history.

It may sound strange to think about holding an internship after you've already held a job.

But MBA-caliber internships are a crucial step toward the career you are planning post-graduation.

## Landing Your Dream Internship

To aid in your MBA internships search, you will have access to the full slate of resources provided by the Gabelli School's Career Development Center, staffed by full-time career advisors who specialize in graduate students' needs and are based full-time at the Lincoln Center campus.

High-ranking alumni on the Gabelli School's Advisory Board also take an active role in helping Full-Time MBA students find internships.
