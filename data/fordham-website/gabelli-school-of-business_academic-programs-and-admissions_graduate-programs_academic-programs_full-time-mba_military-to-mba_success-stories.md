# Success Stories

![Nicolas Fassieux](/media/home/schools/gabelli-school-of-business/Nicolas_Fassieux.jpg)


*What did you do before starting at the Gabelli School?*

I was an aeromedical evacuation officer in the U.S. Army for eight years. I was a helicopter pilot with the specific mission of evacuating wounded service members with life-threatening injuries to hospitals. It was a very rewarding job, especially during my deployment to Afghanistan, where I flew combat missions and helped save the lives of coalition soldiers as well as Afghan citizens.

*How has your experience in the military helped you through classroom experiences so far?*

Much of my military experience was based around critical thinking and teamwork. Though the subject material is different, that high level of critical thinking that I’m accustomed to has paid dividends in the classroom. Team-based activities in class came naturally as well, and it’s been very rewarding to work with such a diverse cohort.

*How do you spend your time outside of class?*

Exploring the city! The Gabelli School is in a fantastic location and there is so much to do and see in Manhattan and the surrounding areas.

*What did you do before starting at the Gabelli School?*

I actually went straight from Fordham undergrad into the MBA program. I’ve been balancing a full-time course load and career since leaving the Marine Corps in December 2015.

*How has your experience in the military helped you through classroom experiences so far?*

The MBA program has been very team-focused thus far. Coming from an extremely team-oriented environment like the military has made the group work and collaboration an easy and enjoyable experience.

*What do you hope to do after you graduate?*

I’m really interested in exploring opportunities around blockchain technology, including how it's going to transform the financial markets and what roles regulation and compliance will play in the future.


Joshua Roden, MBA ’19

*What did you do before starting at the Gabelli School?*

I was a Chinese-Mandarin military linguist for the United States Navy before attending the Gabelli School of Business.

*Why did you decide to get an MBA?*

For the last year-and-a-half of my military contract, I functioned in a technical lead role and I enjoyed being able to work with developers and users to create new and improved tools. I decided to dig deeper and learn more about it in a business context and picked up on the product-management term particularly in the software industry. Ultimately, I feel like I can effect change the greatest from my current position by pursuing the private sector and working from within business.

*Why Fordham?*

I selected Fordham because of my interactions with members representing Fordham, the staff, and the veterans association. Coupled with the fact that Fordham University is known for being extremely veteran-friendly, I know that I can trust Fordham to get me to where I need to go. Along with that, I also appreciated its emphasis on doing business and creating value with real purpose and not for the sake of just making money or profiting. My values are pretty much aligned with Fordham's.

*What did you do before starting at the Gabelli School? *

Prior to Gabelli, I worked as a behavioral health specialist in the United States Army for four years.

*Why did you decide to get an MBA? *

I wanted to further my business knowledge and become a well-rounded business professional.

*How has your experience in the military helped you through classroom experiences so far? *

My military experience has enabled me to appreciate freedom. It has allowed me to further develop patience and perseverance in myself.

*How do you spend your time outside of class? *

Outside of class, I participate in community work. I am a member of the United Sherpa Association.


Michael Tanner, MBA ’19

*What did you do before starting at the Gabelli School?*

I served for 14 years in the United States Marine Corps as a KC-130 Loadmaster as my primary military occupational specialty (MOS) and retired in June of 2014. After retiring from the Marine Corps I planned to utilize my post-September 11 GI Bill benefits to the utmost and immediately began an internship at Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings in White Plains, NY as procurement analyst to gain civilian workplace experience while I finished my undergraduate degree at the Gabelli School. I realized that to be accepted to an MBA program I would need this experience.

*Why Fordham?*

The reason I chose Fordham for both my undergraduate and graduate studies was due to the incredible veteran-friendly reputation that Fordham carries. Other factors that influenced my decision were Fordham’s strong ethical approach to its teaching, the fact that it was a Jesuit institution, the location, and that most classes were of a small class size which ranged from 20 to 40 students.

*How has your experience in the military helped you through classroom experiences so far?*

In the Marine Corps a great emphasis was placed on being professional at all times. This professionalism extends beyond just courtesy towards others and goes into being prepared, effective time management, taking initiative, communication, and being able to effectively work together with other classmates on team projects.

*How do you spend your time outside of class?*

My time spent outside the classroom is a balance between being a new father, networking with Fordham alumni, and being an active member of the Fordham Veterans Association.
