# International Programs

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Fordham University made [the difficult decision](https://news.fordham.edu/university-news/study-abroad-fall-2020/?_ga=2.106407619.1900211239.1597001892-1933748999.1567776297&_gac=1.175369494.1594911387.EAIaIQobChMI-rXUzoPS6gIVwgiICR06sgj_EAAYASAAEgI3ovD_BwE) of suspending all study abroad programs through the end of the fall 2020 semester, in the interest of the health and safety of our students. Still, a multitude of class experiences and co-curricular activities aimed at industry connectivity, cultural awareness and establishing a global mindset are set to take place virtually. Some examples include: [International Business Week](https://www.gabelliconnect.com/featured-events/covid-19-is-focus-of-gabelli-schools-2020-international-business-week/).
