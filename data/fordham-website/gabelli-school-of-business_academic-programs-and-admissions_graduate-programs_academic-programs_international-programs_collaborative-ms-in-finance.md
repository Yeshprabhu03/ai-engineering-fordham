# Collaborative MS in Finance

The collaborative Master of Science in Finance (MSF) program is made possible by global partnerships between Fordham University and several select international schools.

This unique program dates from 2010, when Fordham launched it in collaboration with Peking University’s Beijing International MBA (BiMBA). It has since expanded worldwide.

Students from these partner schools complete some of their coursework at their home institutions, taught by faculty drawn from Fordham and its collaborating partners.

As part of the program, they then spend several weeks in New York. In addition to taking classes, the program includes on-site meetings. In the past, these have included Nasdaq, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Morgan Stanley, Bloomberg HQ, and the United Nations.

Students can only apply to the collaborative MSF through their home institution.
