# Dual Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.)/Master of Studies in Law (M.S.L.)

## A Hybrid Approach – A Competitive Advantage

Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business and Fordham Law School have joined together to offer a 52-credit Dual Master of Business Administration/Master of Studies in Law (M.B.A./M.S.L.) degree, which will provide new options for individuals who are interested in acquiring a graduate-level credential that combines a comprehensive business education from a nationally ranked business school with a specialized concentration in legal compliance from a nationally ranked law school.

The only one of its kind in the country, this dual-degree program affords working professionals with the advantage of being able to **complete their studies part time within as little as two years**. The business courses offer convenient in-person and online study options during evenings and weekends, while many of the law courses that comprise the corporate compliance degree are offered at the University's Lincoln Center campus in Manhattan during the second year or third year of study, depending upon the student's enrollment levels.

### Learn to Work Across the Business and Compliance Functions

The unique value proposition of the M.B.A./M.S.L. is its ability to provide a top-tier business education combined with in-demand knowledge in the increasingly evolving and growing area of legal compliance. It’s an immersive educational experience that meets the rising need for companies and organizations—in complex and rapidly changing industries—to attract and employ business and legal professionals who can work across business and compliance functions to achieve greater efficiency, productivity, and growth. It supports the emergent trend of embedding compliance into day-to-day business operations and the corporate culture for a more strategic, agile, and resilient approach.
