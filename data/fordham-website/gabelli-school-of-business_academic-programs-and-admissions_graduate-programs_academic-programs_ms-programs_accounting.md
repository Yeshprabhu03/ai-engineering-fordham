## Study at your own pace

The Master of Science in Professional Accounting was designed for those with or without accounting backgrounds, as well as working professionals. Our students may choose to pursue courses on either a full-time or part-time basis—allowing them to enroll in as little as one day of classes per week.

## CPA eligibility

The M.S. in Professional Accounting does not meet the educational requirements for Certified Public Accountant (CPA) licensure alone in any State, but may supplement an undergraduate degree in public accounting to meet the CPA licensure educational requirements of your licensure State of interest. Requirements for the CPA license are subject to State-specific requirements and typically require more than successful completion of educational requirements. Because undergraduate accounting programs vary, please visit [nasba.org](https://nasba.org/) to make certain this holds true for your specific bachelor’s degree.
