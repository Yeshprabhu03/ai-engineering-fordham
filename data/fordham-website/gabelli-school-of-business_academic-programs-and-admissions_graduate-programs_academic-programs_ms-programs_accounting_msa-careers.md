# M.S.A. Careers

When we designed the Gabelli School’s Master of Science in Accounting (M.S.A.) program, we didn’t follow what other schools were already doing. We tailored our degree to the needs of major firms. Our graduates are the candidates the Big Four and other companies are looking for—because that is who our program is designed to produce.

Your Gabelli School professors will include accounting professionals who teach based on the most current laws and best practices. They’ve even been known to hire their own students after graduation.
