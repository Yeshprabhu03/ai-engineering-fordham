**M.S.A. ’18**

*Where are you working now?*

I am an assistant vice president at The Blackstone Group.

*Why Fordham?*

Simple—as an institution it shared the same values I had as a person and its curriculum aligned with my personal schedule.

*What was the best part of the M.S.A. program?*

The best part of the M.S.A. program was really having the opportunity to understand real-life scenarios and implications from the instructors and not just problems from the books.

*What was the best part of your experience at the Gabelli School?*

There really isn’t just one best part. It was a culmination of the learning experience along with the available resources and the attention that was given to our performance.

**M.S.A. ’18**

*Where are you working now?*

I am an investment management associate at PwC.

*Why Fordham?*

I chose Fordham because of the great and rigorous Jesuit education. Fordham offers not only a traditional campus but also a campus in New York City. I knew I would value its strong alumni network as well.

*Were you involved in any activities while at Fordham?*

Yes, I was a member of Beta Alpha Psi, Omicron Delta Epsilon, the Finance and Economics Societies, and the Alternative Investments Club.

*What was your favorite class at Fordham? Why was this your favorite class?*

My favorite class at Fordham was value investing. It was one of the most challenging classes I took with some of the brightest students at Fordham. My professor kept the class engaged and challenged us with a project, which provided me with tools that I use at work today.

**M.S.A. ’17**

*Where are you working now?*

I am an experienced associate with PwC in their Risk Assurance Practice.

*What was your most meaningful learning experience at Fordham?*

The most valuable thing I learned at Fordham is: If you want something, ask for it! Be it knowledge or guidance, everyone at Fordham showed me a sense of possibility and helped me reach where I am today.

*How has this program been helpful in your current job?*

I started my work in core audit where my M.S.A. degree directly provided me support in applying whatever I learned. Now, I work in Risk Assurance that still involves a lot of accounting knowledge to accomplish my work.
