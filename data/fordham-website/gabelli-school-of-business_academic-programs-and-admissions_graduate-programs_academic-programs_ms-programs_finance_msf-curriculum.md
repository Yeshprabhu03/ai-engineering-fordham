![GSB MSGF Curriculum](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/gsb_MSGF_Curriculum.jpg)


**An intensive curriculum, with flexibility built in.**

The Master of Science in Finance (M.S.F.) is designed for students who want to specialize in finance.

Located in the heart of New York City, the program provides many opportunities to interact with and learn from industry practitioners and world-class professors. Class sizes are small to facilitate effective instructor-student interactions.

The intensive curriculum is based on corporate finance and investment courses complemented by relevant electives such as Financial Modeling and Programming Language (R/Python), Machine Learning in Finance, and Data Mining and Economic Data.
