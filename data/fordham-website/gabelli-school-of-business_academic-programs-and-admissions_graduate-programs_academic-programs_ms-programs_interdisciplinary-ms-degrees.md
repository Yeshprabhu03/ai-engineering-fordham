# Interdisciplinary MS Degrees

In partnership with other Fordham graduate schools, the Gabelli School of Business offers MS programs that can prepare you for a management career in one of two specific fields: nonprofits or healthcare.

The one-year MS in Health Administration leads to a degree from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

The sections below will provide you with the links you need to learn more about these interdisciplinary MS options.

## Health Administration

Develop the background you need to become an innovator in healthcare administration: in hospitals, private practice, public health, healthcare unions, insurance companies, and many other settings.

**Admissions:** Admission to the MS in Health Administration is overseen by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, not the business school. Visit the GSAS admissions page for more information.

**Program details:** This page provides an overview of the health administration program, which is overseen by a [Gabelli School professor of management](/gabelli-school-of-business/faculty/full-time-faculty/falguni-sen/). Please note that health administration students earn their MS directly from the arts and sciences school.
