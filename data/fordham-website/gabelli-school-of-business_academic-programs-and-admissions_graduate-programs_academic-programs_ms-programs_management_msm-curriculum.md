# M.S.M. Curriculum

## A focus on global sustainability and innovation

The M.S.M. curriculum examines the full range of management topics through this lens, covering strategy, sustainability, organizational behavior, global business analysis, leadership, negotiation, operations, entrepreneurial thinking, decision-making, teamwork, and co-creation. This is where responsible business gets its start.

The global immersion tour is an intensive course that provides students with insights into the context of business innovation. Students visit an international city and gain exposure to the community, politics, and economy through course work, and company and cultural visits.
