You will accomplish this by learning both the analytical/technical skills as well as the marketing and consumer insights. In addition, our program offers you the flexibility to create your path leaning toward the analytical or the creative and consumer insights directions.

We help you develop the competitive edge, the critical thinking, and the marketing intelligence that will make you attractive to employers.
