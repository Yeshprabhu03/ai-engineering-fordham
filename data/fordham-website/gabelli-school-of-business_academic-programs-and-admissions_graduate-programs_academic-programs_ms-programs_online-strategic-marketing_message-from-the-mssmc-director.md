# Message From the Director

Welcome,

The Gabelli School’s online Strategic Marketing Communications master’s degree is a unique program designed for both early and busy career professionals who seek to advance their careers in marketing, corporate communications, and advertising-related fields, and who need the flexibility of online study. Combining the best from the fields of marketing and media communications, this program offers marketing courses such as Integrated Marketing Communications, Marketing Strategy, and Research Methodswith communication courses like Crisis Communication and Corporate Sponsorship. Students are immersed in these related fields to equip them to stay ahead of the vast changes, disruptions, and the rapid blurring of media and marketing that is currently occurring.

Unlike other online programs, the M.S. in Strategic Marketing Communications fosters a sense of community, through a blend of live, online classes during which you interact directly with faculty members and fellow classmates. We pride ourselves on the high level of collaboration and personalized attention we provide to our students, as well as the same quality of education they would receive if pursuing a degree that was delivered in-person.

M.S. in Strategic Marketing Communications faculty members are highly experienced professionals who have worked in industry and/or have founded and led their own companies. You benefit from their first-hand knowledge and practical experience in engaging today’s consumers and building their trust and loyalty.

In addition to the stellar education we provide, students in the program benefit from networking with fellow classmates and program alumni, as well as with alumni from across the Gabelli School (47,000+) and Fordham University (203,000+), who are successful business leaders, innovators, entrepreneurs, and changemakers. We offer numerous networking events—on campus and virtually—that will connect you locally, nationally, and globally.

To deepen your experience and to provide opportunities to bond with your classmates, we have developed an [intensive optional residency](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/graduate-programs/academic-programs/ms-programs/online-strategic-marketing/mssmc-optional-residency/) for those desiring a New York City immersion experience. It includes attending [Advertising Week New York](https://advertisingweek.com/event/awnewyork-2025/)—one of the premier marketing events in the world—a chance to network, visit a top ad agency, and meet with leading marketing, communication, and media executives from major companies and organizations. It's a great opportunity to gain an insider's view of these industries while forging critical professional connections.

As the director of the program and an experienced advertising professional, I welcome you and look forward to learning about your professional goals and objectives. It is a thrill for me to witness the ways in which our students grow personally and professionally, and how the comprehensive business knowledge and skills we provide advances their careers as client service managers, senior account executives, strategy and planning specialists, film and television publicists, news producers, and more.

If you have questions about the course of study, please feel free to reach out to: **Academic Advisor, Lynn Garrity, [email protected]**. Our faculty members are also more than willing to chat with you about this very special learning experience and the ways it can help to advance your career.

Sincerely,

**Timothy de Waal Malefyt, Ph.D.**
