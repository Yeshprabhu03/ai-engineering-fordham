"The MSSMC program delivered way above my expectation, amazing professors, impressive course syllabus I still use some of my class notes and asynchronous class PowerPoint often when preparing RFP or before clients meeting."

"After working at Tommy Hilfiger for 8 years, I recently accepted a great opportunity to join the marketing team at Coach! Today was my first day in my new position as the Global Marketing Manager. I'm extremely proud of this professional advancement and I believe that Fordham was a huge factor in landing this role."

"I can’t thank you and the Gabelli School of Business enough for taking a chance on me in admission to the Strategic Marketing & Communications Masters program. I am honored to conclude this journey among truly brilliant minds and under the careful instruction of wonderful professors and faculty."

I just wanted to take this moment to thank you for everything! The guidance, the support, the shared knowledge. Everything. I knew I wanted to be a part of this program, and I was convinced I would benefit tremendously from it but Fordham totally surpassed my expectations. I gained so much more than I expected and I couldn't possibly thank you and the rest of the faculty enough.

I wanted to say thank you for a great Crisis Communication & Leadership class last semester. Your class was one of those grad school clicking moments where I was genuinely interested in what we were learning and it opened up my mind to things I may be interested in pursuing further. A true “I’m definitely in the right program here at Fordham!” moment.

I wanted to let you know that I just accepted a position as a Project Manager on the creative team at the NFL. I'll be responsible for managing creative & activations at events for the NFL brand team and its sponsors. They made it pretty clear that my education was a big part of the decision to make me this offer.
