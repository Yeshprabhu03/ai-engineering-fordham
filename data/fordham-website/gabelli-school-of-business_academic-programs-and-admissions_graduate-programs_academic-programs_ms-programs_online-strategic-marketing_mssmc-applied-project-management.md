# Applied Project Management

## From Classroom Concepts to Practical Solutions

The Applied Project provides students with the opportunity to take what they have learned in class and apply it to an actual problem a real company is having. Just like in a marketing communications firm or ad agency, team members are assigned management responsibility as well as individual deliverables. The applied project is an opportunity for students to gain real world business experience in designing, developing, and delivering an analytical assignment. It provides tangible takeaways that serve to enhance their résumé and to demonstrate the knowledge they have acquired.

Buzz Knight, the CEO of Buzz Knight Media, has been a strategist and media executive for decades in leadership roles for audio brands. Over 30 years his career has evolved from being a top afternoon drive radio show host and broadcast pioneer in NYC, to heading programming for WLVQ in Columbus Ohio, WKQQ in Lexington, Kentucky, and WMMR in Philadelphia. Today he produces a growing portfolio of podcasts—including "Takin’ A Walk" (which he also hosts), "Music Saved Me," "Comedy Saved Me," and an upcoming Nashville-focused show.

During the summer of 2025, MSSMC students in Professor Janet Gallent's Applied Project Management course partnered with Knight to help grow "Music Saved Me’s" visibility, building a sustainable multi-platform content plan, and expanding the reach of Buzz Knight Media Productions.

**The content plan included:**

- A comprehensive social media calendar and content strategy
- Custom posting templates
- A branding and hashtag campaign supported by research, competitive analysis, and social media best practices

Students gained a deeper understanding of the podcast industry, often meeting with Knight via zoom on the weekends. They worked as a team to produce a plan that would promote a podcast that focuses on the ways in which music, from either side of the speaker can be a healing device for the mental health crisis going on globally.

The students learned a lot and had a great time working with Knight. The feeling was mutual, with him singing the praises of these young professionals and their hard work. This hands-on learning experience illustrates the immersive nature of the MSSMC program and the invaluable industry exposure it provides.

“Every aspect of the Applied Project Management course can be applied to both my personal and professional pursuits. I never did client work before this class -- the practical experience and knowledge gained has made me a stronger and more confident marketing professional. Personally, this class helped me build confidence in articulating ideas and presenting them to others while showing me the value of preparation to reduce stress and produce stronger results. Professionally, I now feel more prepared to manage clients, anticipate their needs, and deliver solutions that create value.”Laura Driscoll ‘25, Social Media Associate, Photographer, NJ Transit

“Professionally, serving as the project manager in this class helped me gain confidence in preparing for my next role hopefully as a Manager on the Content+ Team at Mindshare. It taught me what it means to be a respected manager, including qualities like clear communication, accountability, and supporting team members while maintaining high standards. I also gained practical insights into team management, project organization, and balancing collaboration with deadlines.

Personally, this experience reinforced the importance of listening, empathy, and fostering a positive team environment. I learned that strong leadership isn’t just about directing work, but it's about enabling others to succeed while keeping the team aligned and motivated. I definitely think these lessons will guide how I approach both professional and personal collaborations moving forward”Sophie Lampl ‘24, Senior Associate, Content+, Mindshare

“This class was incredibly useful! While many courses discuss theories, this class actually put marketing communications practices to work. Working with an actual client and creating actual deliverables made this class incredibly "real."

While I had worked on teams before, I had never worked on one quiet like this. For example, I had never developed a project or team charter, nor had I delivered specific deliverables to a client.

I enjoyed the collaborative nature and found the entire process quite interesting. I know feel infinitely more prepared to "go out" into the world and succeed on upcoming projects. This type of experience is truly invaluable. I know that it will stick with me! I look forward to applying this to my current and future roles.”Nicholas Stampone ‘26, Communications/Public Relations Officer, West Essex Regional School District (Part-time)
