# Learning Experience

## A Closeknit Community of Professionals

Unlike online programs that are taught entirely asynchronously, the **M.S. in Strategic Marketing Communications** was designed to ensure maximum interactivity between students, faculty members, and industry professionals from top advertising agencies and marketing and communication firms.

The student learning experience is highly engaging—you will be encouraged to problem solve and think creatively and strategically at every turn. Class time involves students interacting with online materials and answering questions on their own time, followed by deep discussions with the entire cohort through live classes each week. You’ll get to share your ideas, work on team projects, expand your professional network, and build a sense of camaraderie with fellow students and professors.
