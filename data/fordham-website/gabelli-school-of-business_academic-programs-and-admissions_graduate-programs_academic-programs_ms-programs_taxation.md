![FindMBA 2017](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/findmba_2017_badge.jpg)


The **Master of Science in Taxation** **(MST)** offered by the **Fordham University Gabelli School of Business** not only focuses on teaching finely honed technical skills that allow students to stay on top of this ever-changing field, it also provides the guidance, support, and lessons to allow them to seize leadership opportunities in and outside the classroom. Our students also cultivate creative problem-solving techniques and a clear-eyed view of business ethics and social responsibility.

## Flexible scheduling and online modality

**Beginning in** **Fall 2023**, **all tax courses in the MST will be offered online (live “synchronous” courses), allowing students to obtain their MST fully remotely**. Students may choose to pursue their degree on either a part-time or full-time basis, with part-time students having the option of taking classes only one day per week. This scheduling, along with online courses, makes the program ideal for working professional accountants, attorneys, and business executives. However, for those who would also benefit from an in-person experience, electives in accounting will be available in courses that are taught fully in-person. *For example, aside from the six required tax courses, the MST student could take four accounting courses*.

## Faculty of working professionals

Classes emphasize up-to-the-minute tax law and trends; giving students experience solving real-world problems. Our full-time faculty members and adjunct instructors are industry experts who teach from their own experiences as top professionals within New York City’s financial sector.

## Connections with taxation experts

Students interact with leading tax professionals in the classroom, as well as during networking opportunities and events featuring guest speakers for those able to attend in person; learning about developments and trends in numerous areas of tax law and the tax profession.

## All undergraduate backgrounds welcome

The M.S. in Taxation program does not require an undergraduate accounting degree. The program enrolls working professionals and recent undergraduates from a variety of liberal arts and business backgrounds. (Students who need to take certain prerequisites, such as introductory tax or introductory accounting, should be aware that those courses are generally offered only in person).

## CPA licensure

For those students who have an undergraduate background in business, the program may also help meet the credit criteria in order to sit for the CPA exam, while also offering an edge over less-specialized peers. Our courses also will help those taking the tax discipline part of the CPA exam after 2023.
