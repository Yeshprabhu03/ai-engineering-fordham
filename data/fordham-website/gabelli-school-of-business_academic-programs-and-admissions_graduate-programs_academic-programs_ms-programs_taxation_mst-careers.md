As society evolves, so does the tax code, in response to such developments as the legalization of same-sex marriage or changes in the regulation of mergers and acquisitions. Because the Gabelli School M.S.T. faculty is made up of working professionals, our program keeps up with those changes in real time. That means you’ll graduate with the most current technical know-how combined with a rich background in communication and business skills.
