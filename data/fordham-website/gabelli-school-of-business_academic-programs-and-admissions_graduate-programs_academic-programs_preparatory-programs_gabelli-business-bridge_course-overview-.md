**Introductory Statistics (3 credits)**

Statistical analysis is vital and everywhere. Facts and figures can be found throughout all areas of society. It is essential to learn how statistics are generated and what the data mean. This is true from quantitative researchers to consumers. In introductory statistics, students learn the underlying theory of statistics, hypothesis testing, z-tests and t-tests, ANOVA, linear regression, and other methods. You will learn how to execute these statistical functions and use data from existing sources to develop their ability to engage with and critique statistical data. The class examines data from many different sources. Students develop an understanding of how statistics are used on a daily basis to regulate and guide our decisions. This course satisfies application requirements for a master’s degree at the Gabelli School by awarding three applicable and transferrable credits.

**Group Project**

As a student of the Gabelli Business Bridge, you will leverage your learning, and work with your team to analyze a business case study. This work will give you a demonstrable example of your business skills that you have learned throughout the program. At the end of the program, you will also have hands-on experience delivering a business presentation to your colleagues. Students will be guided throughout the process.

**Course Format**

This program utilizes a virtual format. You will be instructed by live faculty, and you will be able to ask questions and participate in classes along with your peers. You will also have the opportunity to engage with faculty during virtual live office hours throughout the program.

The curriculum for the Gabelli Business Bridge will be following a learning model where approximately 75 percent will be live (synchronous) with the remainder being recorded videos, readings, assignments, quizzes and exams. Each morning will contain three hours of synchronous sessions with breaks.
