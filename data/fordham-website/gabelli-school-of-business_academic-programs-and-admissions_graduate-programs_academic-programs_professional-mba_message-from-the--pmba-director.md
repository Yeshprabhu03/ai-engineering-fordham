# Message From the Director

Greetings,

![Sertan Kabadayi PMBA Director](/media/home/schools/gabelli-school-of-business/Sertan_Kabadayi_PMBA_Director.jpeg)

Our Professional M.B.A. (PMBA) program is designed with working professionals in mind—ambitious, hard-working individuals who want to advance their careers while seeking deeper knowledge, broader perspectives, and stronger leadership skills needed to thrive in today’s fast-changing business world.

At the core of our program is a commitment to excellence—reflected in our world-class faculty, cutting-edge curriculum, caring administrators, global alumni network, and prime New York City location. But more than anything, what truly defines our program is our students.

Gabelli School PMBA students represent a wide array of industries, career stages, and backgrounds. They bring a wealth of real-world experience to every classroom, enriching discussion and fostering a dynamic, collaborative learning environment. This diversity drives powerful peer-to-peer learning that complements faculty insight and academic rigor.

Our students are more than professionals—they are changemakers. Motivated by purpose, they lead with integrity, embrace innovation, and drive sustainable impact across sectors. They value our program’s commitment to responsible leadership, global awareness, and ethical decision-making.

The Gabelli School PMBA program is structured to meet the needs of busy professionals. With a flexible yet predictable format, students can balance career, personal life, and education without compromise.

Beyond the classroom, we offer a wide range of enriching experiences that build connections and expand horizons. From orientation activities to networking events with alumni and peers across all Gabelli M.B.A. programs, students are welcomed into a vibrant, supportive community. Furthermore, Global Immersion Programs expose them to international busi-ness practices and cultures, while dedicated career advisors and executive coaches provide personalized guidance for career advancement or a pivot into new opportunities.

As program director, I am continually inspired by our students—their resilience, intellectual curiosity, and generosity of spirit. They graduate not only with advanced business acumen but with a renewed sense of purpose, ready to make a meaningful impact in their organizations and beyond.

Thank you for your interest in the Gabelli School Professional M.B.A. I invite you to learn more about the program and see how it can help you to shape your future, while becoming a valued member of this truly unique teaching and learning community.
