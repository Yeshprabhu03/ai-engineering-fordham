# One-Week Global Immersion Program

## Expand Your Knowledge, Broaden Your Horizons

In today’s global business environment, with so many multinational companies driving economic growth, it is critical for business leaders to have an international perspective. The Gabelli School PMBA is one of only a few part time M.B.A. programs that provide students with the opportunity to visit the world’s leading business capitals and emerging financial hubs.

PMBA one-week Global Immersions include company visits, presentations by business professionals/executives, and cultural and social activities. From large corporations across the finance, banking, marketing and advertising, manufacturing, fashion, and retail sectors to government agencies and start-ups, students gain a holistic understanding of business culture and practice. Best of all, Global Immersions are included in your activity fee!

“From the beginning to the very end of the trip in Berlin I found it both fascinating and very different from what I thought it would be like. The economic facts, their infrastructure, and society/culture were all so interesting and eye-opening to the issues they face and the solutions they are taking.”
