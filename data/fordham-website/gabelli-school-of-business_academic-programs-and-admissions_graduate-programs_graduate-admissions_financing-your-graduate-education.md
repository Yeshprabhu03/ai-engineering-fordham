Ben Kaufman completed an undergraduate degree in economics and had worked for a number of years in the digital marketing space before applying to the Gabelli School’s Full-time M.B.A. program. Once admitted, he was fortunate enough to receive a **Dean’s Premier Scholarship** and was deeply grateful for the financial support it provided. “It helped to reduce my cost of living expenses and earning a graduate degree, as did the income I received from being a graduate assistant.” Kaufman was a research GA assigned to Professor Hooman Estelami, Ph.D., and developed a relationship with him that extended well beyond his time at the Gabelli School. “While earning my degree, I helped edit his books and took on general responsibilities to support his research,” Kaufman noted. “Once I graduated, we remained in touch, and he has been incredibly supportive in helping me to address challenges as they arose in my career. He also helped me to explore my options and offered guidance as I was searching for my current role.” The mentoring Kaufman received, combined with the opportunity to lower the cost of earning his M.B.A., illustrate the deep commitment the Gabelli School has in providing an outstanding, affordable graduate education.
