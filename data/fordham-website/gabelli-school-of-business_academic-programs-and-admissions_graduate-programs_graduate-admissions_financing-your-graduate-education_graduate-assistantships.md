### How it works

-
To be included in the pool of students shared with faculty members and administrative offices, students MUST submit the Graduate Assistant Application by the term deadline outlined in the invitation email.

**No exceptions will be made to include students who do not submit an application by the deadline**.The Graduate Assistant Application opens for students, nearly two months prior to the beginning of each term. Application submission closes for students about a month into the term.


Staff and faculty members review the applications as they are received. They have until the end of the second month of the term to reach out to applicants to offer graduate assistant positions. Once a supervisor and student agree to work together, an approval form is submitted by the supervisor. Graduate assistants are paid by tuition remission within 7-10 business days of having the approval form submitted.Students may be hired as graduate assistants for a maximum of 20 hours per week in any given term. The 20 hours may be split among more than one faculty member or administrator.

Graduate assistantships are only posted for the current term, and it is up to your supervisor if they will be hiring you for the following term. Students may submit another application for the following term once it becomes available.
