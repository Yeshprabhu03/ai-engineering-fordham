### A Successful Admissions Story and So Much More!

#### Qing Chen, GABELLI’19

**Data Engineer - Energy Service Engineering, Tesla**

![Qing Chen](/media/home/schools/gabelli-school-of-business/Qing_Chen_headshot.jpg)

When Qing Chen contemplated moving to the U.S. from China to earn a degree in business analytics, she recognized, in addition to excelling academically, she would need to build the communication and networking skills to ensure hersuccess. Little did she know, the Gabelli School Admissions team would play an instrumental role in making this possible.

As part of her application process, Chen was interviewed in Shanghai by members of the admissions team, who made her feel comfortable and kept in touch with her even after she accepted their offer to enroll in the M.S. in Business Analytics. Encouraging her to apply for a graduate assistantship within the Admissions Office, they opened the doors for her to network, enhance her communication skills, and build relationships with students who had professional experience in her field of study.

“The Admissions team members were great! They not only provided guidance during the admissions process, but also persuaded me to become a GA, which broadened my horizons, helped me to meet other students, and shaped my career path.”
