# Core Curriculum - Gabelli School of Business

## Teamwork. Creative problem-solving. Sharp. Polished.

What is Gabelli's integrated business core curriculum? It’s our delivery system for a nationally renowned grounding in business fundamentals.

This four-year sequence of courses covers the subjects in depth that all employers want their job candidates to know: marketing, finance, strategy, accounting, information technology, and business communication.

But there’s more. Because of the unique way the integrated core is taught—using hands-on scenarios that replicate the challenges of the real business world—it cultivates characteristics that will distinguish you as a business leader.

## How does the integrated core work?



The integrated core is organized into building blocks. You progress through them as you move from freshman through senior year.
