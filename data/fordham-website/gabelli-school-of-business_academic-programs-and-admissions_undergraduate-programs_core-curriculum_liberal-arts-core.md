# Liberal Arts Core

## What’s philosophy got to do with business?

In short, everything.

You can work in business if you know how to analyze a Form 10-K or write a marketing plan. You can lead in business if you know how to think critically, frame questions, and see alternative perspectives.

This is what the Gabelli School’s liberal arts core teaches you.

### Thirteen courses to unlock the world.

At Fordham, business students take a robust 13-course liberal arts core curriculum that complements the integrated business core. This dual education sets you apart.

You will be a businessperson. But you will also be a writer. A thinker. A historian. And a very interesting human being.
