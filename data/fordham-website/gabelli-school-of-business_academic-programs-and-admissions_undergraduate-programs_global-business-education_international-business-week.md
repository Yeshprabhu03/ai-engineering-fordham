# International Business Week

The Gabelli School of Business International Business Week (IBW), is a five-day series of lectures, panels, and executive lunches on the topic of global business. It presents a variety of events geared toward learning more about international business, economics, politics and culture.

The week begins with a global showcase fair, staffed by Gabelli’s international and study abroad students. The Kickoff Event highlights various countries' unique cultures and global business opportunities.

During the week Gabelli students enjoy international themed activities such as global video competitions and visiting international organizations in New York City. Previous visits included the United Nations and the French American Chamber of Commerce.

IBW takes place annually in March on both the Rose Hill and the Lincoln Center campus.
