# Boyle Scholars

Membership in the Father William Emmett Boyle Society is a privilege that the Gabelli School created for its students.

At its core are two Jesuit principles that lie at the heart of a Fordham education:

**Magis, which means “more”—doing more and achieving more in everything we pursue**. Boyle Society members are encouraged to promote a sense of excellence and accomplishment in their lives and the lives around them.**Homines pro aliis, which means “men and women for others.”**Members take a special interest in promoting the concept of community and supporting their fellow students, especially in academic areas where they can offer others their strength.

How does all of this play out in Boyle Society members’ daily lives?

Members have the privilege of assisting faculty in their research, an experience that will set them apart when they are applying for graduate school and jobs. They also receive special attention in preparing for prestigious national and international scholarships, such as Rhodes, Marshall, and Fulbright Scholarships; regional scholarship programs; internal Fordham University awards; and fellowships and assistantships.

They contribute to the greater good by tutoring classmates and younger students who may need extra help in academic subjects they have mastered.

Who was Father Boyle?

Father William Boyle, SJ, (1914-2000) was a true leader at the Gabelli School of Business. As a dean, professor, student adviser, and Jesuit, he was a positive thinker who stressed the importance of academic excellence and living life to the fullest. To him, this meant being a leader who gave back to the community. In 1999, through the support of many grateful students, the Boyle Society was founded to honor his memory and continue his legacy of outstanding scholarship, leadership, and community service.
