Imagine having the chance to become an expert in a specific area of business—making discoveries that no one else has made—before leaving college. That chance is available to Gabelli School students through our undergraduate research programs. New investigations lead to innovations in business. As a result, research gets attention. University professors around the country take notice. Industry leaders do, too. An amazing undergraduate research project could lead to an amazing job.

## How can you do your own original research?

[Global Business Honors Program](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/undergraduate-programs/honors-programs/global-business-honors-program/): Students in this selective program devise an independent research project and work one-on-one with a faculty adviser.[Honors Thesis Program](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/undergraduate-programs/honors-programs/undergraduate-research/honors-thesis-program/): High-achieving juniors are invited in the fall of their junior year to participate in this special three-course sequence, in which they learn about research methodology and complete an original investigation with guidance of Fordham faculty.

Did you know? The Gabelli School publishes its own [Business Student Research Journal](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/undergraduate-programs/honors-programs/undergraduate-research/research-journal/). Projects from the programs above may be chosen for publication.

## How can you help leading faculty with their research?

[Boyle Society](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/undergraduate-programs/honors-programs/honor-societies/boyle-scholars/): Members who want to contribute to Fordham business faculty research are assigned a research assistantship with a specific professor, based on common interests.- Research Center Fellowships: Undergraduates can win fellowships with the
