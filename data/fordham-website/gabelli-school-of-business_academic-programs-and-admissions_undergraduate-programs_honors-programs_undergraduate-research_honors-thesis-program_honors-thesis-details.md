# Honors Thesis Details

Superior Gabelli School of Business students have the opportunity to distinguish themselves by participating in the **Honors Thesis Program**. This three-course sequence enables them to conduct **original business research** of publishable quality.

[proposals](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/undergraduate-programs/honors-programs/undergraduate-research/honors-thesis-program/thesis-proposal/), are aimed to help current juniors who are invited to apply to the program to understand it and their potential role in it.

The Honors Thesis Program begins in the spring semester of a student’s junior year. During that first term, each participant (1) learns research methodology, (2) identifies a thesis topic and, by the end of the term or shortly thereafter, chooses a thesis advisor, and (3) with the advisor’s help, begins to refine a specific thesis topic and related research methodology. The outcome of this first semester is a proposal that includes a comprehensive literature review and a “roadmap” for a theory-based study. At the conclusion of this first semester, students present their proposals for approval, delivering an oral presentation before final exam week and a formal written proposal soon afterward.

The thesis program continues in fall of a student’s senior year. During this second semester, each student learns more about research, refines the specific proposal, and, if an empirical study, gathers relevant data and begins to analyze the data. Students with strong proposals are encouraged to apply to showcase their work at the [National Conference on Undergraduate Research](http://www.cur.org/conferences_and_events/student_events/ncur/).

The third and final term, spring of a student’s senior year, encompasses final data analysis, writing a first draft, and editing it—under the advisor’s and Honors Thesis Program director’s supervision—into the final draft. Honors thesis students present their research findings at the annual Gabelli Undergraduate Business Research Conference in April. Students who complete an honors thesis earn a medal at Awards Night during the week before graduation. The thesis voted “best” each year earns a special award.
