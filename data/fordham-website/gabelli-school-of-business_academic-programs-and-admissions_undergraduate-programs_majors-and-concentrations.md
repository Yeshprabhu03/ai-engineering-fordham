No matter what your business interest, start your education here.

We are a cohesive, unified school that offers the advantages of two locations—we’ve simply made either the [Rose Hill](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/undergraduate-programs/which-campus/rose-hill/) or [Lincoln Center](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/undergraduate-programs/which-campus/lincoln-center/) campus the home base for each of our specialized business programs.

Where can a Fordham business degree take you? Check out your options.

## Majors

Students choose a major or concentration in their sophomore year, which represents their main academic focus.

**Lincoln Center:**

## Primary Concentrations

If your major is business administration at Rose Hill, or Digital Media and Technology at Lincoln Center, you will add depth in a field of your choice through a primary concentration, which requires three to five courses. Certain students may pursue more than one of these.

**Lincoln Center:**

## Secondary Concentrations

No matter what your chosen major, you can add a secondary concentration as an overlay. It's an additional layer of specificity that sets your business degree apart. These are open to students on both campuses.
