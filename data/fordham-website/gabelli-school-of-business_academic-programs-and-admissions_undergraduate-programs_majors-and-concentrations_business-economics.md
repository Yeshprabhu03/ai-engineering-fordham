# Business Economics Concentration

Understanding economics is essential for everyone in business. If you do not comprehend how the world economy works, you cannot pass "go."

Business economics ensures that every Gabelli School student has a strong handle on the forces that push, pull, and shape the economies of the United States and other nations.

It differs from standard economics in that it emphasizes practical applications in the world of commerce, but the courses are still drawn from Fordham's [economics department](/undergraduate-admission/majors-and-minors/economics/).
