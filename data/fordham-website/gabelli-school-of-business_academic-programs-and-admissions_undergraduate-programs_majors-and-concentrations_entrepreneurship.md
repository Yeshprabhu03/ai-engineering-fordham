Entrepreneurship: Not just a field, but a mindset.

The Gabelli School of Business prepares its students to tackle real business problems with an arsenal of knowledge, skills, and experiences. Our entrepreneurship program turns students into change agents and disruptors to seize countless opportunities in front of them. We do this by re-calibrating how students think about money, failure, what a career is, what kind of lifestyle they want, and what kind of impact they want to have in the world.

Entrepreneurship is not easy. It is not for the faint of heart. But it is a door to opportunity for students who are intrigued by the path less traveled – for students who value freedom and independence and creativity, who don’t like being pigeon-holed in the typical career path, or who are looking for an exciting, non-traditional lifestyle.

The entrepreneurship concentration was developed to deliver a forward-thinking, skills-based curriculum driven by experiential learning to change the way students think. Regardless of one’s career trajectory (the startup world, corporate America, nonprofits, etc.), students learn how to vet opportunities, pitch ideas, become innovators, and confidently change the world for the better.
