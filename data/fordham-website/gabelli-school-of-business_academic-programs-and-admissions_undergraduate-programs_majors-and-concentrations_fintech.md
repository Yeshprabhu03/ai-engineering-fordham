# Fintech

The Gabelli School of Business offers a three-course secondary concentration in fintech, co-designed by the finance and information systems faculty.

The role of technology in the business world in general, and the finance profession in particular, is exploding. The term “fintech” refers to a range of disruptive applications ranging from Bitcoin to high-speed trading to mobile banking. This concentration is ideal for students who have an interest in these areas and who sense the inherent value in the point where finance and information systems meet.

## Extracurricular activities

The Fordham Fintech Network provides out-of-class professional development opportunities and leadership positions for both undergraduate and graduate students. This student organization puts together a fintech conference in the spring semester that is attended by alumni and fintech professionals from around New York City.

Current students who seek more information about this concentration should see their class dean, who can provide details on prerequisites and course registration.
