# Global Finance and Business Economics Concentration

Financial decisions have effects that touch every corner of the world.

The Gabelli School at Lincoln Center’s global finance and business economics program prepares you to make choices that have a far-reaching positive impact.

In our society, financial services professionals are sometimes nicknamed “masters of the universe.” A Fordham finance career will help you to use that mastery for good, increasing prosperity and economic participation on a global scale.

## We will teach you to:

Conduct financial analyses

Sell and trade securities

Manage investments

Manage risk

You will tap into the resources of Fordham University’s liberal arts faculty, in subjects such as [economics](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/departments/economics/), [history](https://www.fordham.edu/undergraduate-admission/majors-and-minors/art-history/), and [political science](/undergraduate-admission/majors-and-minors/political-science/), to support and round out your financial expertise.
