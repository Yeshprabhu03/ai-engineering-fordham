# Global Marketing with Consumer Insights Concentration

Companies need marketers who can explain people. Unravel the mysteries behind why people buy what they buy, and you will be immeasurably valuable.

By drawing together knowledge from [marketing](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/undergraduate-programs/majors-and-concentrations/marketing/), psychology, [sociology](/undergraduate-admission/majors-and-minors/sociology/), and [anthropology](/undergraduate-admission/majors-and-minors/anthropology/), you will be able to develop creative new approaches.
