# Sports Business Concentration

Major League Baseball.

The NBA.

Athlete management and licensing.

ESPN, *Sports Illustrated*, NBC Sports.

The range of employers and careers in the sports world is vast, and the Gabelli School has established a secondary concentration to prepare students for them. A secondary concentration is an "overlay" that can be pursued on top of any major, from marketing to finance to business administration.

To complete the secondary concentration, Lincoln Center and Rose Hill students take three courses:

- Sports Marketing
- Business of Sports Media
- Sports Law

They also do a “capstone project,” which can involve holding an internship in the sports world, completing a sports-related travel experience and writing about it, or presenting a research paper at a sports-focused conference.

Other sports-related courses are offered, too, and while they don't count toward the sports business concentration, they are a great addition to students' academic portfolio. Current examples include:

- Business and Ethics of Sports
- Sports Analytics

If you're interested in the area where business and sports meet, you'll find tons of like-minded classmates at Fordham. There's a club called the
[Business of Sports Society](/gabelli-school-of-business/student-and-career-resources/undergraduate-student-resources/student-organizations/business-of-sports-society-at-fordham/) that brings in speakers from the New York Yankees to sports media giant IMG.

Sports-related internships are everywhere in New York City, which is home to 11 professional teams, all major networks, media powerhouses, and agencies that represent athletes across sports.

Start thinking about what yours will be.
