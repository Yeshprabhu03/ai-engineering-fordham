# Student Managed Investment Fund

This is no mere "stock-market game." Each semester, 24 junior and senior finance students work together to invest a million dollars of Fordham University’s actual endowment. The result — in addition to a proud track record of above-the-benchmark performance — is a hands-on learning experience like no other.

**Gabelli's Student Managed Fund is a Unique Opportunity**

Lots of schools have programs like this one. What makes Gabelli’s Student Managed Investment Fund different?

- Our fund is larger than most: $1 million, compared with funds at other schools that hover between $150,000 and $200,000.
- Ours is a multi-asset-class, internationally invested fund. While other universities’ students are restricted to investing in domestic stock, Fordham undergraduates have the freedom to experiment with international and domestic securities, bonds, commodities, and foreign exchanges.
