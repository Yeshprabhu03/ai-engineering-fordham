*Sustainability has increasingly been regarded as standard business practice for corporations. Yet, many firms still struggle to integrate sustainability. In this course, we will take a strategic approach to understanding and creating solutions to corporate sustainability issues, such as climate change, that managers face at present. By applying strategy tools and frameworks, this course will illustrate how firms may cope with sustainability pressure and transition towards a more sustainable way of conducting their business, while providing further insights into how sustainability challenges may be considered opportunities rather than obstacles. We will also consider sustainability-oriented value creation and business models where firms more explicitly seek sustainability as their primary goals rather than as a secondary objective. This course should be of value to students keen on developing critical thinking skills and analytical skills surrounding corporate sustainability.*
