# Careers in the City

Fordham students have a massive advantage over their peers at other business schools when it comes to careers.

That advantage lies in internships.

Consider this:

- Most Gabelli School students have four or five internships on their résumés by the time they graduate—97 percent of students do at least one, and nearly 70 percent of students hold two or more.
- 94 percent of Gabelli School undergraduates are in full-time jobs or master’s degree programs within six months of finishing school.
- 75 percent of seniors who get job offers before graduation report that an internship led directly to a full-time position.
