# Alumni Lifelong Learning - Audit a Course

As a member of the Fordham University alumni community, the Gabelli School of Business offers you an invaluable opportunity to audit classes each semester. No matter what your interest or career trajectory, our courses can help to increase your knowledge in a specific business-related area, provide information on trends across industries, and enhance your résumé.

Special pricing is available at just $450 per class—substantially less than what you would pay if you were taking the course as part of a degree program. Auditing a course affords exposure to top industry experts who impart their knowledge and provide you with immediately applicable skills.
