Dear Gabelli School Alumni,

We are excited to introduce our new alumni website—a dedicated space designed to celebrate the Gabelli School experience. This platform strengthens connections among our alumni, fosters meaningful engagement with the School, and links you to the broader Fordham alumni community.

As a Gabelli School alumna/nus, you are part of a 45,000+ global network of professionals who have built highly successful careers at some of the top companies and organizations in the world. Individually, each of you has contributed to your field, utilizing the knowledge and skills you’ve acquired at the Gabelli School and during your own unique professional journey. Imagine the power and the possibilities of combining your deep industry expertise, expansive networks, and enduring loyalty to Fordham and the Gabelli School to help us help those who will follow in your footsteps.

This site will provide you with the latest updates on what’s happening at the Gabelli School—from increases in our rankings and the global expansion of our brand, to the launch of innovative academic programs and the integration of AI into our curriculum. It will also showcase your many successes and highlight ways for you to get involved.

As part of our recently launched [Five-Year Strategic Plan](/gabelli-school-of-business/about/strategic-plan/), we seek to leverage the talent, leadership, and connections of our alumni to move the School forward, while enhancing our ability to place our students in internships and jobs, increase their opportunities for networking, and make a Gabelli School education accessible.

We hope you will join us! Learn more about [how you can get involved](/gabelli-school-of-business/alumni/get-involved/). I look forward to learning about your success and working together to build an alumni community that serves our students and graduates alike.

With gratitude and best wishes,
