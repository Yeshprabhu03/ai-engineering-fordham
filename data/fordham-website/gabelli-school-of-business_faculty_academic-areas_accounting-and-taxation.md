Accounting is the language of business, and Fordham professors help their students to become fluent in that language. Core-level accounting classes give students the basic skills to interpret and analyze financial statements, while upper-level and special-topics courses—such as corporate taxation and ethics in financial reporting—help them specialize their knowledge. Fordham's accounting faculty works with highly motivated students through the university's chapter of [Beta Alpha Psi](/gabelli-school-of-business/student-and-career-resources/undergraduate-student-resources/student-organizations/beta-alpha-psi/) and routinely coaches teams in prestigious accounting competitions organized by multinational accounting firms. Fordham is also on the cutting edge of teaching sustainability reporting.
