# Ethics in Business Seminar Series

Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business is one of the world’s academic leaders in normative business ethics, providing critical insights into the most pressing ethical issues in business, both perennial and emergent. The Ethics in Business Seminar Series convenes thought leaders in the field to initiate critical inquiry and discussion in the New York City area and beyond. In the best Jesuit tradition in business ethics, the Series seeks to understand the normative underpinnings of business practice, the social function and the ethics of markets, the nature of professional roles and their responsibilities, and the purpose of business firms and their executives.

We moderns tend to focus on numerous reasons for ethical failure—so-called moral luck, moral dilemmas, moral tragedy, perverse incentives—that Aristotle largely ignores. Aristotle focuses instead on ethical success at the species level. However, ethical success may not be as achievable as Aristotle assumes. This paper considers numerous reasons for thinking that Aristotle’s theory of virtue ethics, a theory centered on human excellences realized through practices inextricably bound to the larger world of politics, would need to be revised substantially to be applicable in modern corporate life and work. Modifying the theory is itself problematic on numerous scores.

Is Competition Inherently Sleazy?

-
Joseph Heath presents his market failures approach to business ethics as a happy medium between cynicism and the idealism of traditional moral theories such as Kantian ethics, which Heath believes to be incompatible with important forms of competition. The market failures approach defends some real ethical limits in business, beyond following the law, but it condones certain deviations from the norms of everyday morality in the interest of economic efficiency. On this view, a certain level of sleaziness in business is permissible and inevitable, even if it is regrettable. Robert Hughes argues that Kantian ethics provides a better account of the ethics of competition than the market failures approach does. Kantian ethics is in fact compatible with competition, both on the market and in the workplace. On some key issues, notably including the issue of truthfulness and disclosure, Kantian ethics permits competitive strategies that the market failures approach forbids. Moreover, when Kantian ethics deems the reasoning behind a competitive strategy morally acceptable, it endorses the strategy without any ethical reservations. There is no reason to regard justified business practices as regrettable or sleazy.

The Messy Ethics of Business Organization

-
Underlying some of the most influential normative theories of business ethics is the assumption that there is an asymmetry between the moral responsibilities of managers and those of subordinates, arising in virtue of the control managers have over organizational decision-making. Empirical research on business organizations casts doubts on this assumption. While organizational decisions are routinely attributed to managers, the decisions themselves are the product of collective action processes over which managers have little control. Managers may be able to influence the outcome of these processes, but so can subordinates. In some cases, subordinates may have more influence than managers. This suggests that the primary domain of business ethics is not managerial decision-making, but instead the various behaviors by which people (managers or otherwise) exert influence on organizations. I end by discussing how a theory of business ethics that focuses on these behaviors would differ from standard theories.

Consent in the Digital Age

-
This paper analyzes consent in the digital realm, arguing that this context reveals the limitations of existing theories and expands our understanding of morally transformative consent. By developing a taxonomy of consent's morally transformative features and applying it to the digital realm, the paper aims to correct the failures of digital consent while highlighting the limitations of current philosophical understanding. It argues that for consent to be morally meaningful for individuals, strong communal protections for rights must exist in the background, suggesting the need to integrate insights from political philosophy into traditional consent theory.

Virtues and Values in Professional Ethics

-
Reflection about professional values and principles has taken center stage in contemporary discussions on professional ethics. In this paper, I argue that a full-fledged ethics of the profession needs to incorporate virtues as a core element within the theory. First, I provide some reasons in support of giving virtue—alongside values and principles—a central role in the ethics of the professions. Virtues, I will argue, are not reducible to values, which are related in complex ways. Next, I will develop a skill model of professional virtue, with a focus on the creative professions and will examine some of the key character traits that are needed to excel in these professions. Last, I will point out some advantages of the virtue approach to professional ethics. The paper concludes by suggesting some implications of this approach for professional education and institutional design.

Hussain on the Market: Critique or Kvetch?

-
In order to qualify as such, a critique of capitalism should take issue with features that are specific to that economic system, which is to say, features that would not be present after some feasible reorganization of the economy. Otherwise the critique is not really a critique of capitalism, but rather of the human condition. I refer to this as a kvetch. Waheed Hussain's book,

*Living with the Invisible Hand*, is intended as a critique of the market economy. I analyze Hussain's argument in order to determine whether it counts as a critique or a kvetch.

From Business-as-Usual to Suddenly-Unacceptable: Lessons for Ethical Business Today from the “Whiteface” Marketing of Black Music by the American Recording Industry, c. 1956-68

-
One of the most striking features of our contemporary social world is how quickly something can go from “business-as-usual” to “unacceptable” to “retrospectively unbelievable.” Current undergrads might find it surprising that it was “normal,” not so long ago, for students and professors to smoke during classes; and, more recently, for liberal arts colleges to demand that applicants for admission or employment identify themselves as either male or female. Were either thing to happen today, it would be considered outrageously inappropriate. This gives rise to two questions for business ethicists:

- How is it that practices, which we will soon come to see as unacceptable, are able to hide in plain sight for so long without many critiques? And,
- Can conscientious individuals and managers get reliably “ahead of the curve”? That is, how can we identify and reform problematic practices that are still widely tolerated… without going “too far” in our reforming zeal and inviting ridicule?

This seminar, led by Wayne Norman. Ph.D., explores the first of these very general questions through the vivid presentation of a very concrete marketing practice that was employed by virtually all record labels in the 1950s and 1960s. We can call this practice the “whitefacing” of Black jazz and R&B/soul artists, and it “hid” very much in plain sight on the covers of hundreds of 12” vinyl LPs by major and minor artists alike for about a dozen years. (We will survey these LP covers throughout the presentation.)


Whitefacing seems eventually to have been recognized as “unacceptable” quite suddenly around 1967-1968; despite there having been no public movement against it. There also seems to be no historical memory of this whitefacing phenomenon, even within the community of scholars of African-American popular culture. So, it now seems “retrospectively unbelievable,” even as you see it with your own eyes. We will consider some “educated speculation” about how this all could have happened, and about what this neglected case study tells us about the challenges today for those who want to be at the vanguard of ethical business within a society still beset with systemic injustices.

Plato’s Paradox: Why Ethical People Should Lead But Shouldn’t Want To

-
Professor Joanne Ciulla, Ph.D., professor and director of the Institute for Ethical Leadership, Rutgers Business School, examines why leaders behave unethically. Drawing on Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Weber, and others, she argues that under extreme circumstances, moral transgressions such as lying and doing harm are part of a leader’s job, which can lead to ethical transgressions that are not.

Is Public Ignorance a Problem? An Epistemic Defense of Real-Existing Democracies

-
Does good governance depend on citizens being knowledgeable of relevant facts and best policy ideas? A questionable model of preference aggregation suggests that this type of knowledge matters, and inspires provocative proposals for disenfranchising the most ‘ignorant’ voters. We argue democracies do not require people to be know about facts and policies to perform well. Instead, good outcomes depend on whether decisionmakers are able to track social feedback from citizens regarding their diverse life experiences, views and values and, facing conditions of radical uncertainty, come to understand public grievances, policy implications and trade-offs. Tracking this feedback requires a synergy of isegoria - the equal right of citizens to participate in political life - and parrhesia – the opportunity to say almost anything openly. Democracy’s competitive ecology both enables and compels political actors to explore this feedback in ways that mitigate the problems of elite capture, opportunism and radical dissonance, ultimately producing better governance.
