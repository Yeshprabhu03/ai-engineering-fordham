The leading people and organizations area at the Gabelli School of Business focuses on the following strategic areas:

- Ethical leadership
- Career management, focused on personal and professional calling
- Innovation, including social innovation
- Entrepreneurship, including social entrepreneurship
- Global sustainability management

The area’s [faculty research](/gabelli-school-of-business/faculty/academic-areas/leading-people-and-organizations/lpo-research-activities/) has global visibility and is frequently cited in professional journals and the popular press. Some faculty focus mainly on individual-level factors such as character, trustworthiness, or mindfulness. Others look at the group level of what makes highly functional teams work. Many examine how organizations of all kinds can better contribute to solving social problems. Overall, the area’s research aims to create insights on how people can manage better.

Faculty contribute to this goal by participating on editorial boards, editing globally prominent journals, and serving in leadership roles in the Academy of Management and other professional associations.

Two endowed chair positions at Fordham reflect the leading people and organizations area’s values: the Felix Larkin Chair of Character-Based Leadership and the James A.F. Stoner Chair for Global Sustainability. Renowned faculty from across the University and beyond collaborate with the area.

Undergraduate students take the integrated core course Principles of Management and can select electives in management consulting, leadership, creativity and innovation, and sustainability and entrepreneurship.

Undergraduates have access to these opportunities to earn degree credentials related to leading people and organizations:
