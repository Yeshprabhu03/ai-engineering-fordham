Marketing Data Analytics comprises the activities and processes of collecting, cleaning, manipulating, and analyzing data to generate actionable managerial insights. Insights on patterns, associations, and predictions help firms identify opportunities for innovative offerings and pinpoint potential issues and threats. The marketing implications span monitoring, understanding, evaluating, and improving firm offerings, customer experiences, and marketing and financial objectives. Job roles in this area are becoming increasingly specialized, and employees need to acquire specific skill sets as they progress in their careers. Many companies have merged Marketing Data Analytics roles into Business Intelligence departments, which may also include Consumer Insights and Market Research.
