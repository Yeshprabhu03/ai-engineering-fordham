This section reports the emerging roles in marketing that may not yet be established as a separate domain. These are roles in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Sustainability. AI roles are evolving rapidly, while roles in sustainability are more established and have become more prevalent recently.

-
While leading companies have long been using Artificial Intelligence (AI) for marketing applications, Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) is a new and evolving area of marketing careers. Two broad job areas seem to have emerged. The first area includes marketing roles focusing on marketing applications of Gen-AI, and the second area includes marketing jobs related to the marketing of Gen-AI platforms to companies. The nature of the responsibilities is evolving rapidly—the listed areas below present general employment areas rather than specific job titles.

-
Job roles are transforming as firms explore new ways to employ Gen-AI for marketing applications. Job listings are gradually starting to have Gen-AI as a required or optional skill. It is anticipated that a wide range of marketing roles will use AI or Gen-AI tools, one way or another, in the future.

Relevant managerial positions are fewer at this time since the top leadership in most companies is responsible for making fundamental decisions. Strategic leadership develops strategies to take advantage of the opportunities provided by Gen-AI and address potential challenges. They work with firm leadership to define, shape, and execute Gen AI strategies within their business. These leaders may partner with policymakers, researchers, sales professionals, engineers, and other stakeholders to adjust to the changing AI and public policy landscape and drive new requirements across company teams. They provide internal consulting, issue policy or guidance on high-impact AI use cases, and evaluate AI-driven products to assess risks and define requirements.
