Chris Laszlo, PhD, is a visiting professor at Fordham and advises the LPO area with regard to leadership for sustainability and flourishing.

He has numerous articles in peer-reviewed journals and is the general editor of The Business of Sustainability.

As a co-founder and managing partner of Sustainable Value Partners LLC, he provides advisory services to senior leaders in some of the world's largest companies. Laszlo has led hundreds of seminars and spoken widely on sustainability for strategic advantage both at companies and at leading business schools.
