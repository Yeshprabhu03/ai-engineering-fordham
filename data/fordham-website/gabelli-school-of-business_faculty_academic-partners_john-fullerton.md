John Fullerton is founder and president of Capital Institute, a collaborative network focused on how our economy and financial system can operate to promote a more just, regenerative and sustainable way of living.

He is the architect of Regenerative Economics, first conceived in his 2015 booklet, "Regenerative Capitalism: How Universal Patterns and Principles Will Shape the New Economy." Regenerative Economics and Finance promises to unlock the profound and presently unseen potential that is the source of our future prosperity and the reason for hope in our troubled times.

Previously, Fullerton managed numerous capital markets and derivatives businesses around the globe and was JPMorgan's Oversight Committee Representative, and finally was Chief Investment Officer for Lab Morgan before retiring from the firm. Fullerton is the Chairman of New Day Enterprises, PBC, the co-founder of Grasslands, LLC, and a board member of the Savory Institute, and Stone Acres Farm.
