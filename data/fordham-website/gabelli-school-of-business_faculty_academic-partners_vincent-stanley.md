Vincent Stanley is Patagonia's Director of Philosophy and a guest lecturer at Fordham University. In 2018, he discussed corporate responsibility and sustainable business at a talk organized by the Gabelli School's Center for Humanistic Management.

Stanley, co-author with Yvon Chouinard of *"The Responsible Company*," has been with Patagonia on and off since its beginning in 1973, and for many of those years in key executive roles as head of sales or marketing. More informally, he is Patagonia's long-time chief storyteller.

Stanley helped develop the Footprint Chronicles, the company's interactive website that outlines the social and environmental impact of its products. He is a visiting fellow at the Yale School of Management.
