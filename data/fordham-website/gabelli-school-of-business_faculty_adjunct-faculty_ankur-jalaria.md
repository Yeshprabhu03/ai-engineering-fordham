Ankur Jaluria joined Universal McCann Worldwide (UM) in 2016, assuming positions of increasing responsibility before taking on her current role—vice president, decision sciences—in 2021. During her tenure at UM, she has supported luxury brands like American Express and BMW in their media efforts to drive awareness and sales.

Prior to joining UM, Jaluria was a software developer, working at Deutsche Bank and Bank of America Merrill Lynch. With the goal of transitioning into a banking role, she earned an M.B.A. in Finance and Marketing from New York University’s Stern School of Business. Later, she decided to change her path again, completing an M.S. in Marketing Intelligence at Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business and successfully launching her career in marketing analytics.

Jaluria has served as an adjunct professor at the Gabelli School of Business since 2021, bringing real-world experience in marketing analytics and the unique perspective of a career changer to the classroom. Her exceptional work at the Gabelli School was recognized with the Dean’s Award for Faculty Excellence.
