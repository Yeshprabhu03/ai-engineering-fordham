Over the course of his career, Evan Shapiro has been an outspoken thought leader in the entertainment industry. For many years via his work with Ghetto Film School and One Day Immersion, he has strived to make the media business a more diverse and inclusive community.

For decades, Shapiro has created innovative, award-winning programming and media properties, including “Take My Wife,” “Funny Women of a Certain Age,” “This Film Is Not Yet Rated” (Sundance Film Festival Collection), “Dinner for Five” (Emmy Nomination), “HitRecord” (Emmy Award), “Brick City” (Emmy Nomination and Peabody Award), and the iconic “Portlandia” (Peabody Award). He is currently producing the podcasts “Cancel Culture” and “Next with Novo”; the feature film “Grimm Legacy” for Disney+; the feature “All Over Christmas” with Vortex Pictures; and the series “Cooper’s Bar” for AMC, which debuted on May 31, 2022.

Recently, Shapiro’s impact on media has expanded, as he has evolved into a noted commentator on the entertainment industry and has become recognized as the Unofficial Official Cartographer of The Media Universe. In 2020, Deadline published Shapiro’s first Media Universe Map, the first view of the media business to truly include all the major combatants in the war for attention. It immediately was adopted by businesses, executives, analysts, and colleges as the unofficial official representation of the map of media. His essays on media have become must-reads for industry professionals, ongoing mapping of the Media Universe have made him one of the most influential thinkers in the business and a sought-after speaker. He serves as an adjunct professor of media and entertainment at both New York University’s Stern School of Business and Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business. Through the change agency ESHAP, Shapiro and team offer their community of partners insights and services for how to make, sell, and use media right now, and next.
