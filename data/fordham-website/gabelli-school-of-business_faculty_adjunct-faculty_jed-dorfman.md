A graduate of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, he began his career as a sixth-grade teacher in rural Louisiana, where he also coached multiple sports. During the summers, he worked at Camp Walt Whitman, a private children’s summer camp in New Hampshire. In 2004, after earning an M.B.A. from the Peter F. Drucker School of Management in Claremont, California, he became the Camp’s director. Since 2006, he and his wife have run Camp Walt Whitman together.

Beyond his leadership in camping, Dorfman is a sought-after speaker and trainer at industry conferences. He was a founding director of *America’s Camp*, a nonprofit that ran for 10 years, serving children who lost a parent on September 11. He also is the founder and executive director of *Zeal Adventure and Travel*, a summer travel and community service program for high school students.

When not working or teaching, he can usually be found on the sidelines, coaching or cheering on his three children in their sports endeavors.
