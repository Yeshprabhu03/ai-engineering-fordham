Nariman Gathers does process. They turn the mushiness of humaning (being a person) into discrete, discernible task flow. Gathers has used this superpower to help design communications identity at Code2040, build and sustain distributed teams at GitHub, manage incident communications at Slack, tackle some of the nation’s most pressing issues with the ACLU, and helm the design ops program at Plaid. They currently manage Design Operations at Verily, an Alphabet Company, and teach design process at Stanford’s d.school, Fordham University, and the New School at Parsons. Gathers is the recipient of the 2022 Converse University Young Alumni Prize and a TedX Stanford speaker. They are a proud plant dad, a champion for neurodiversity, and will cry about friend-shaped objects.
