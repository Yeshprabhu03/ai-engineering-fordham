# Russell Fink

## Adjunct Professor of Communications

Russell Fink is an adjunct professor at Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business, where he educates the next generation of media executives on the ins and outs of the ever-evolving media landscape by teaching classes such as Television: An Evolving Landscape and Media Executive Playbook. His most recent book, *The Media Spectacle: Captivating the Audience,* was published in 2024 and is available on Amazon and at Barnes & Noble.

Fink holds a B.F.A. in film and television from New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts and an M.B.A. in marketing and mass communication from the Gabelli School.

He started his career as a freelance television producer for networks such as VH1, MTV, and Comedy Central before moving into multiplatform programming, development, and analytics at companies such as Court TV, A&E, and Showtime Networks.

Fink then combined his passion for sports and programming by moving to the regional sports network, SNY, where he is currently the senior director of programming and content analytics. His role at SNY enables him to keep a bird’s eye view of the current RSN business model and the changing world of cable.

After spending the past 25 years in the world of media and almost 20 years specifically in sports media, Russell has a proven track record of continually developing an optimal digital/linear programming mix that drives sustained viewership growth. His extensive experience with every facet of multiplatform programming makes him an in-demand guest speaker for media conferences, podcasts, and panels. In April 2022, he was selected by TV Leaders Today to be profiled for his work as a sports executive.
