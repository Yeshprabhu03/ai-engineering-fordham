[Spotify's Direct Listing: Is it a Recipe for Gatekeeper Failure](https://scholar.smu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4781&context=smulr)?, argues that direct listings pose a unique danger to investors, because there is no traditional underwriter to vet the offering. The article was cited in[Brief Of The Cato Institute As Amicus Curiae In Support Of Defendants And Appellants](http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/2020-11/prirani-v-slack.pdf)at 17, Pirani v.

Professor Horton's article, The Going-Private Freeze-Out: A Unique Danger for Investors in Delaware Non-Corporate Business Associations, focuses on how such modifications harm unwary investors, and was cited by the Delaware Court of Chancery in several cases, including
