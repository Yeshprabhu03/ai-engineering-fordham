Derek Lief is an Assistant Professor of Strategy and Statistics at the Gabelli School of Business at Fordham University.

His research focuses on better understanding how firms can most competitively position themselves through the selection of human capital, and the incentive structures they implement to attract, retain and motivate job seekers and employees alike. He also examines how incentives affect both an entrepreneurial orientation and entrepreneurial outcomes.

His work has been supported by several prestigious fellowships and awards. These include the Neubauer Research Fellowship from 2022 - 2024 and the Foreign Language Area Studies (FLAS) Fellowship from 2021 - 2024.

Derek holds a Ph.D. in Strategy and Political Science from the University of Michigan, a Master of Applied Statistics, a Master of Public Policy and a Master of Middle Eastern and North African Studies, all of which are also from the University of Michigan. He also holds a Master of Teaching Arabic as a Foreign Language from Middlebury College and a Bachelor of Arts in History from Haverford College.
