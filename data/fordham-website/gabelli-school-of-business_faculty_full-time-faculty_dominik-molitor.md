Dominik Molitor is an associate professor of Information, Technology, and Operations at the Gabelli School of Business. Professor Molitor earned his Ph.D. (Dr. oec. publ.) in business administration and information systems from the Ludwig Maximilians University Munich.

His research interests lie at the intersection of behavioral and technical aspects of information technology. Molitor mainly focuses on (digital) retailing, location-based advertising, quantitative UX, and digital public policy. He relies on econometrics and data science methods using large-scale observational data as well as lab and field experiments, often based on mobile applications, including geo-fencing and GPS/location data.
