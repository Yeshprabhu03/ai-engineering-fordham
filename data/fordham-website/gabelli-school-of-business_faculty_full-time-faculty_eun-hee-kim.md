Dr. Kim is a strategy scholar whose research interests lie in strategy, sustainability, green technology, energy, business and government relations, nonmarket strategy, and social media. Her work focuses on how firms strategically behave to adapt to a socially responsible business environment. In particular, her research falls into four streams: which mechanisms work in the interaction between a firm and its stakeholders through formal information disclosure; how firms embrace more recent informal disclosure channels such as social media; how regulation and deregulation affect firm investment in green technology both at domestic and international level (e.g., the Kyoto Protocol, EU-ETS, and the Paris agreement); how firms’ various initiatives on sustainability affect firm performance and stakeholders.

Dr. Kim serves on the Editorial Boards of top tier journals in the strategy and sustainability fields:

*Strategic Management Journal, Organization Science (*Outstanding Reviewer Award, 2024), and*Organization & Environment*. Her research has been published in the*Strategic Management Journal, Organization Science,*and*Journal of Environmental Economics and Management*, among others.
