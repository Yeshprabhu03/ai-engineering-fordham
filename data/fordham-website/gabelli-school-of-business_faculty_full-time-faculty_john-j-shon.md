John J. Shon is an associate professor of accounting at the Gabelli School of Business. He received his PhD in accounting with an emphasis on corporate finance and microeconomics from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. In his doctoral research, he examined how the earnings surprises of high-technology companies, such as biotech firms, affect their disclosure practices due to expected litigation costs under SEC Rule 10b-5.

Professor Shon's research interests include the behavior of sell-side analysts and their resultant earnings forecasts and stock recommendations; CEO insider trading behavior and earnings management; firms' R&D expenditure patterns; and option-trading strategies around earnings announcements.

Professor Shon has taught in the United States, Europe and Asia at a range of levels: undergraduate, M.B.A., executive M.B.A. and international executive M.B.A. He has won multiple teaching awards.

Prior to academia, Professor Shon worked in KPMG's Financial Services assurance practice, as well as KPMG's risk management advisory practice. He has also recently consulted for hedge funds, biotech startup companies and distance-learning companies.
