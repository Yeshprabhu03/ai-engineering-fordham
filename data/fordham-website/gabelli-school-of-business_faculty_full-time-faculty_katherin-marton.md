Katherin Marton, a Fordham professor of finance and business economics, has done extensive consulting work for the United Nations, visiting the majority of countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia to perform on-site studies of their technological development.

Beginning with the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, Professor Marton focused her research on the economic and social transformation of Eastern and Central Europe, her home region. She received a Fulbright grant in 2011 to research and teach in Bolivia, where she applied her history of investigating foreign investments in developing countries to the model of mineral exploitation pursued under the government led by Evo Morales.
