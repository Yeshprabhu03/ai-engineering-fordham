Mark Silver, a professor of information systems and associate dean of undergraduate studies at the Gabelli School of Business, received his B.A. in mathematics from the University of Pennsylvania and his Ph.D. in decision sciences from the Wharton School. Before coming to Fordham, he was a faculty member at UCLA's Anderson Graduate School of Management and at New York University's Stern School of Business. Professor Silver has served as a senior research fellow at the Higher Education Finance Research Institute and as a systems analyst with International Data Base Systems, Inc.

A presenter at prestigious conferences in the United States and overseas, Professor Silver introduced the concepts of "system restrictiveness" and "decisional guidance" into the information-systems literature. His research focuses on the connection between the design features of IT artifacts and their effects and on the design features of interactive computer-based systems, especially decision-support systems and browser-based applications. In these contexts, he is especially interested in the role of restrictiveness and guidance.

Professor Silver wrote a book titled

*Systems that Support Decision Makers: Description and Analysis*, and he developed the IT Interaction Model, an approach to teaching the MBA-level core course in information systems. One of his papers, "A Foundation for the Study of IT Effects: A New Look at DeSanctis and Poole's Concepts of Structural Features and Spirit," co-written with M. Lynne Markus, earned dual best-paper honors in 2008: one from the Senior Scholars Consortium of the International Conference on Information Systems, and the other from the*Journal of the Association for Information Systems*, in which it was published.In service to his field, Professor Silver was editor of the

*DSS-92 Transactions*, associate program chair for AMCIS 2004, track chair for ICIS 2008, associate editor of the*management Information Systems Quarterly*and a member of*Organization Science's*editorial review board. In 1994, he was named reviewer of the year by*Information Systems Research*. He has also served on the steering committee of the Knight Higher Education Collaborative. -
