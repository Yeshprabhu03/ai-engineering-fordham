Professor Han’s research interests lie in the broad area of information systems and business analytics, with a current focus on information management and information technology in healthcare systems. He conducts large scale data analysis and develops analytical models to study a series of issues in the nursing home rating system developed by CMS, such as rating inflation detection, evaluation, audit design, and IoT adoption. Besides healthcare, Professor Han also conducts research, both empirical and analytical, in fields such as social media, gamification, behavioral studies, electricity market auction, machine learning, and blockchain, etc.

Professor Han’s work has appeared in journals such as Production and Operations Management (POM), ACM Transactions on Management Information System (TMIS), and conferences/workshops, such as CIST, WITS, POMS, CHITA, etc. His research won the 2016 National Institute for Health Care Management Foundation Grant and has been reported by multiple media, including a live broadcast on C-SPAN 1.

Professor Han earned his Ph.D. degree in Operations and Information Management from the University of Connecticut (UConn). He also holds an M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (UConn), an M.S. in Statistics (UConn), and an M.S. in Control Theory and Control Engineering (USTB).
