Yuliya A. Komarova, an associate professor of marketing at the Gabelli School of Business, holds a Ph.D. from the University of South Carolina in addition to an undergraduate degree in marketing and an M.B.A.

Dr. Komarova's research interests lie primarily in the realms of affect-related biases in consumer judgment, ethics in advertising and neuroeconomics. She focuses on public-policy implications of consumers' suboptimal economic decisions as a consequence of their mood, emotions and feelings. She also is interested in a neural circuit for the processing of affect and the ways these processes influence how consumers react to advertising messages.

Dr. Komarova has presented her research to organizations such as the Association for Consumer Research, Society for Consumer Psychology and American Marketing Association. She received the Best Conference Paper Award at the summer 2008 American Marketing Association Conference, and in 2013, she received the Robert Johnston Highly Commended Paper Award.
