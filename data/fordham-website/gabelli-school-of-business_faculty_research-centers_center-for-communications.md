# Center for Communications

## About the Center

The Center for Communication, founded in 1986, conducts research about media industries, consumer use of media, economic and social media trends, and organizational communication in companies. Full-time faculty from the Gabelli School's Communications and Media Management area serve as Senior Fellows at the Center.

We sponsor conferences, meetings, and seminars for media scholars, industry professionals and students. Recently, the Center hosted the World Media Economics and Management Conference. The center also facilitates interaction among academics, industry leaders and policy makers, and is affiliated with the Media and Entertainment Alliance, a Gabelli School graduate business student organization.
