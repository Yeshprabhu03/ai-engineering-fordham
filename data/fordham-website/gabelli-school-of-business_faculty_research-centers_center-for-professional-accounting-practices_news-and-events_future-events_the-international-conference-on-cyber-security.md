#### Conference Overview

In today’s global business environment, cybersecurity is no longer just an information technology issue—it has become a critical component of effective risk management for companies and organizations of all sizes. Increased reliance on technology to operate, communicate, and store sensitive data has greatly escalated potential risks associated with cyber threats. Even a single data breach, ransomware attack or IP theft can lead to devastating financial losses, incalculable legal repercussions, and irreparable damage to organizational trust.

The 11th International Conference on Cyber Security (ICCS), which will be hosted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business, will feature presentations by the FBI on case studies and will focus on cyber security’s critical role in the areas that matter most to global businesses and organizations.

- Understanding the Evolving Cyber Threat Landscape and Addressing Cyber Risks
- Researching and Evaluating Cyber Security Solutions
- Managing Costs and Value of Cyber Security Investment
- Mitigating Financial Risks Associated with Cyber Attacks
