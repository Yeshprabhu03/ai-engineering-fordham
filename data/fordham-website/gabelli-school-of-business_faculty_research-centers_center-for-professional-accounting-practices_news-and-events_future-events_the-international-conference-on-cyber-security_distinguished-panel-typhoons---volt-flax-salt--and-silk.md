**Moderator: Marc Raimondi**, Chief of Staff, Silverado Policy Accelerator

Over the past 18 months, China's cyber activity has accelerated, and the "Typhoons" -Volt, Flax, Salt, and Silk- demonstrate how private sector visibility, combined with government authorities and capabilities, can disrupt even the most sophisticated operations. Without action from industry leaders like Microsoft, Palo Alto, and Verisign, these campaigns could have gone unchecked. We’ll discuss how to strengthen this collaboration while respecting consumer privacy and ensuring a resilient approach to future threats. The lessons from our past disruptions are clear—what we do now will define our resilience in the years ahead.
