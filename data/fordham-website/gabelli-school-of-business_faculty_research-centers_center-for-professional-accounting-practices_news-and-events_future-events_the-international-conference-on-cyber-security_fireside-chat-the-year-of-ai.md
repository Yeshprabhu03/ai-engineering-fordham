**Moderator: Jason Healey**, VP of Security Products, OpenAI

In just a few short, disruptive years, AI has evolved from an experimental novelty to a foundational tool for cybersecurity teams. As OpenAI's chief information security officer and head of security, Matt Knight led this transformation from the inside—exploring what AI can offer defenders while building and protecting OpenAI.

In this fireside chat titled "The Year of AI," Knight, who now serves as VP of security products, OpenAI, will discuss the emergence of large language models and the parallel transformation of security strategy, operations, and tooling across the industry. He will reflect on the pivotal moments that saw AI models like GPT-4o and o3 emerge as indispensable tools for security teams. He also will share lessons from building AI-powered defenses at OpenAI, the evolving sciences of AI and cybersecurity, and how these experiences inspired his new mission of bringing these defenses to the world.

In addition, Knight will discuss what the security community must do to keep pace with both the risks and opportunities generative AI presents—ensuring we shape a future where AI strengthens rather than outstrips our collective defensive posture.
