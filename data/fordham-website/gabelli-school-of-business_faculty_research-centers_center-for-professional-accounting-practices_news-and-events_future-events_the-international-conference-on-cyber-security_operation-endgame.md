In May of 2024, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced Operation Endgame, a multinational coordinated cyber operation by the United States, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, with assistance from Europol and Eurojust, that was designed to dismantle criminal

infrastructure responsible for hundreds of millions of dollars in damages worldwide. It was the first coordinated international operation of its kind, involved a dozen countries that conducted searches and questioned or arrested subjects, and took down or disrupted more than 100 servers to defeat multiple

malware variants. The malware “droppers” and “loaders” were used to gain access to victim’s computers, either dropping ransomware or other malware.
