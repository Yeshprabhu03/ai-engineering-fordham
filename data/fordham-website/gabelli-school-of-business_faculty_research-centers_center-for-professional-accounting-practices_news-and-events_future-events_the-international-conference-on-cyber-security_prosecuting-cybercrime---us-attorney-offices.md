**Moderator: Erica Orden**, Reporter, Politico

This panel provides a critical discussion between the chiefs of the Criminal Divisions for the United States Attorneys for the Eastern and Southern Districts of New York, focusing on the multidimensional challenges of cybersecurity.

A crucial dialogue between the chiefs of the criminal divisions of the United States Attorneys for the Eastern District and the Southern District of New York is essential to forge a unified and robust strategy against evolving cyber threats. This discussion should encompass the current and projected cyber threat landscape, recognizing New York's status as a global financial and commercial hub, and therefore a prime target for sophisticated cybercriminals, state-sponsored actors, and organized crime groups leveraging ransomware, intellectual property theft, and critical infrastructure attacks.

The Attorneys must also address the complexities of criminal prosecution in the cyber domain, including jurisdictional challenges, technical expertise requirements for successful litigation, and strategies for asset forfeiture and victim restitution. Discussions should prioritize disrupting cybercriminal enterprises, safeguarding critical infrastructure, combating financial cyber fraud, and deterring future attacks through effective legal enforcement.

Furthermore, the dialogue will integrate the roles of law enforcement, government oversight, and prevention. This includes fostering seamless collaboration with federal agencies (e.g., FBI, CISA, Secret Service), local law enforcement, and international partners. Strategies for enhancing public-private partnerships, promoting information sharing, and implementing proactive prevention initiatives (e.g., public awareness campaigns, industry best practices) will be vital.**Pre read: ****https://www.justice.gov/jm/9-51000**
