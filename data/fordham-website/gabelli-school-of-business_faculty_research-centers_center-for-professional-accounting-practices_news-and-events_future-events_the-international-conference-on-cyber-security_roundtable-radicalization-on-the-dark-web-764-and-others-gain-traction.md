This panel will delve into the alarming nexus of youth radicalization, terrorism, violent extremism, and child exploitation, with a specific focus on the enabling role of the dark web. The discussion will explore the multifaceted challenges posed by these interconnected threats to national security and public safety.

Experts from law enforcement will share insights into investigative strategies, intelligence gathering, and the operational complexities of identifying and disrupting illicit activities on encrypted networks. The cybersecurity perspective will address the technical intricacies of the dark web, including anonymization tools, cryptocurrency transactions, and the development of countermeasures to track and attribute malicious actors. We will examine the critical role of government oversight in establishing effective regulatory frameworks, fostering international cooperation, and balancing security imperatives with civil liberties. Furthermore, the panel will highlight innovative prevention strategies aimed at safeguarding vulnerable youth, promoting digital literacy, and countering extremist narratives online.

A crucial component of this discussion will be to delineate what the legal profession needs to know to effectively navigate this evolving landscape. This includes understanding the legal frameworks governing cybercrime, international law enforcement cooperation, digital evidence collection, and the ethical considerations involved in prosecuting cases related to terrorism, violent extremism, and child exploitation facilitated by the dark web.
