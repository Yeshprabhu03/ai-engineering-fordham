# Frank J. Petrilli Center for Research in International Finance

## About the center

Funded by the Gabelli School, CRIF promotes interdisciplinary collaborations among financial engineers, historians, monetary economists, and legal scholars, within the University and beyond.

With a general focus in international finance, CRIF supports a wide variety of research topics, including:

- The behavior of international financial markets
- The microstructure of these markets
- The institutions surrounding international financial markets
- The historical development of these markets
- The process of international financial integration and the globalization of markets.

CRIF sponsors a
[working paper series](/gabelli-school-of-business/faculty/research-centers/frank-j-petrilli-center-for-research-in-international-finance/research/working-paper-series/) and holds regular research workshops. To foster interaction and collaboration with researchers outside Fordham, the center also sponsors a visiting scholar program, which draws active researchers in relevant areas to the University for short-term visits and collaboration. On occasion, CRIF also serves as a host or co-host for conferences on specific topics of interest to the research community.
