"My son had a wonderful experience both as an undergrad and graduate student at the Gabelli School of Business. He received a scholarship for his graduate study and my donations to Fordham reflect my appreciation for that support. Today, he is a CPA, and a senior tax consultant at Deloitte. The investment in his education has paid off and we are incredibly grateful.”

"My daughter is having a great experience as a Gabelli School student, with excellent professors and a variety of learning and working opportunities to participate in on- and off-campus. She has benefited from internships she has completed, including one as a 2024 Summer THRIVE intern at Scotiabank. We are deeply appreciative of the financial aid she received, which has made this experience possible for her."
