As a collaboration between the Gabelli School, PVH Corp., and EY, the Work.2040: Future of Work in a Sustainable World conference explored global trends that are shaping the future of work and society, with the goal of inspiring collective action that preserves respect for human rights and promotes dignity and well-being in a sustainable world.

- Sessions covered people-focused business strategy, the potential impact of climate change on the world economy, data-driven decision making in the workforce, and corporate agility
- Produced TED-style videos featuring speakers from Cognizant and WIRED

“This remarkable gathering of business and academic leaders profoundly illuminated the economic, social, and technological forces shaping the future of work. I felt privileged to be part of it.”
