PVH Corp. participants took part in a program that provided non-finance-focused staff with a foundational understanding of the financial landscape in which public companies operate

- Six sessions were delivered virtually to 30 PVH Corp. staff members per session
- Participants improved their understanding of the relationships between the economy, company performance, financial markets, politics, stock prices, credit, and risk

“Participants came from a range of disciplines outside of finance such as sales, technology, administration, and operations. The program was so well received that PVH may expand it to cover advanced topics in business in the future.”
