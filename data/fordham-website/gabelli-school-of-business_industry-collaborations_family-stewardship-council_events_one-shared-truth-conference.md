Conference Overview

In today’s rapidly evolving financial landscape, The One Shared Truth Conference (1STC) at Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business brings together leaders from finance, technology, and academia to examine how innovation is reshaping global markets. Through panels and interactive sessions, the conference will explore market efficiency and arbitrage, the tokenization of traditional and non-traditional assets, the rise of stablecoins as new payments and settlement rails, and how professional investors approach evaluating opportunities and taking on exposure in the ecosystem . 1STC is designed to foster thoughtful dialogue, share real-world insight, and connect the next generation of finance professionals with today’s industry innovators.

Who Should Attend

The One Shared Truth Conference welcomes a diverse audience of participants, including entrepreneurs and builders developing the next generation of financial technology and decentralized systems; family offices, institutional investors and asset managers seeking to understand tokenized products, new settlement rails, and market innovation; emerging professionals and students exploring careers in fintech, blockchain, and modern financial infrastructure; and academics and researchers analyzing market structure and distributed ledger technology.

Why Attend

Attendees will gain insight into the technologies and market developments transforming finance — from how arbitrage highlights inefficiencies in digital markets to how tokenization and stablecoins are reshaping settlement and access to assets. The conference offers a chance to understand emerging trends, hear directly from industry leaders, and connect with professionals and peers driving change at the intersection of finance and technology.
