Cole has published research on how the security mechanism of Bitcoin wallets (and other UTXO cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin (LTC) and Dogecoin (DOGE)) inflates apparent transaction volumes by 8 times, reduces the apparent cost of Bitcoin transactions by 3–7 times and inflates wallet counts; this skews the perceptions of increasing adoption as Bitcoin’s price rises. Cole served as a subject matter advisor to the Operations Subcommittee of the Wyoming Stable Token initiative, which launched as Frontier token (FRNT) in August 2025 as the first stabletoken issued by a ‘sovereign’ in the United States (rather than by a for-profit firm).
