# Panel Discussions

The annual +Alpha Panel introduces a non-traditional investment thesis to the FSC community. Last year’s conference highlighted “Monetizing Fandom” for attendees, exploring how restructuring in the entertainment industry is creating new channels for investment and increased opportunities for generational wealth creation. This year’s +Alpha panel discussion will focus on “Outer Space as Triptych.”

Outer Space as Triptych: National Security Imperative, Investment Frontier, & Public Goods Consideration

As nation states compete with firms for claims over orbital real estate, outer space has become both a national security imperative and an investment frontier for those with the eyes to see demand for services and goods sourced in space. At the same time, as private interests begin to dominate the nighttime sky, global humanity is at risk of losing access to public goods and long-valued rights (e.g., privacy). Join us for this important conversation.

Narratives as Glue: Family Firms, Offices & Foundations

Narratives bind us as social animals. Personal narratives provide motivation, while Family narratives enhance both legacy and strategy. Investment narratives make allocation decisions rational to observers and attract both capital and trust. Impact narratives within foundations help focus attention on precise problems in specific geographies. The conversation will cover both the individual level and organizational level impact of narratives – those told to oneself, to insiders within one's organization, and to outsiders who may provide opportunities or capital (both social or financial). This panel will explore the power of narratives in guiding decision-making and focusing attention.

Patient Capital during Impatient Times: Private Debt & Private Equity Markets

Family offices historically are known for deploying ‘patient capital’ – free from the constraints of quarterly earning pressures and architected to grow wealth across longer time horizons. This makes both private debt and private equity investment opportunities attractive; data show that family office allocations in private markets are increasing. Yet the world is being rocked by instability and erratic shifts every day, making long-term, inflexible financial entanglements less attractive than more flexible offerings. This panel will explore the attraction and burden of private market investments.
