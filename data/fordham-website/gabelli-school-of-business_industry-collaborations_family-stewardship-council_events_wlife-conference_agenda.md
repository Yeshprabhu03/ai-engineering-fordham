# Agenda

**Thursday, March 12, 2026**

4:00 p.m. – 7:00 p.m. (Doors open: 3:30 p.m.) [The Moore Family Business:](/gabelli-school-of-business/industry-collaborations/family-stewardship-council/events/wlife-conference/pre-conference-workshop/)[A Case Study in Women’s Leadership and Succession >](/gabelli-school-of-business/industry-collaborations/family-stewardship-council/events/wlife-conference/pre-conference-workshop/)

Family enterprises are often shaped by the quiet and typically powerful influence of women—whether they are founders, successors, spouses, or members of the rising generation. This interactive workshop uses the Moore Family Business case to explore the critical roles women play in family-owned companies, both seen and unseen. From Martha’s decades of steady stewardship, to Jen’s quiet yet essential operational role, to Claire’s bold leadership in sales and succession, participants will see how women’s influence can make or break generational transitions. Space is limited to 60 participants.

This powerful conversation dives into the lived experiences of women navigating the road to leadership. Together, we will explore how women rise above barriers such as gender bias, imposter syndrome, and limiting expectations, not by suppressing who we are but by embracing each facet of our identities.

Breakout Sessions

[Breakout 1: Marrying Into a Family Business](/gabelli-school-of-business/industry-collaborations/family-stewardship-council/events/wlife-conference/panels-and-breakout-sessions-/#d.en.188188)

When you marry into a family enterprise, you join more than just a family—you step into a legacy. This session unpacks the opportunities and challenges of integrating into the business, building trust, and finding your voice within an established system.**Location:**Law School, Room 3-01[Breakout 2: Multi-Generational Dynamics - Five Generations at the Table](/gabelli-school-of-business/industry-collaborations/family-stewardship-council/events/wlife-conference/panels-and-breakout-sessions-/#d.en.188192)

With as many as five generations engaged in today’s family enterprises, managing expectations, values, communication preferences, leadership styles and so much more is increasingly complex. This session explores tools for bridging generational divides, fostering collaboration, and honoring each generation’s contributions and perspectives.**Location:**Law School, Room 3-03[Breakout 3: Giving Up the Reins](/gabelli-school-of-business/industry-collaborations/family-stewardship-council/events/wlife-conference/panels-and-breakout-sessions-/#d.en.188205)

Transition is never easy—especially when it means letting go of leadership and ownership control after decades of pouring time, resources, and passion into the business. This session examines why senior-generation leaders struggle with stepping back, and how successors can navigate this delicate process with empathy, respect, and clarity.**Location:**Law School, Room 3-04

Women in family business often wear multiple hats at once—leader, owner, parent, partner, advisor, and more. This discussion dives into how women balance overlapping identities, manage expectations (that are often paradoxical), and stay grounded while driving both family and business forward.
