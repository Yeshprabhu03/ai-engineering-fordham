Fireside Chat with Loida Nicolas-Lewis

Growing up, Loida Nicolas-Lewis’ father had a vision for her—he saw her as a lawyer and politician, while secretly she wanted to become a nun. Expectations were set, but as it turns out, both were both wrong. Nicolas-Lewis did end up becoming a lawyer, however. But also a wife, mother, activist, general attorney for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, and CEO of TLC Beatrice.

Hers is a story of having to constantly pivot and adapt. *“Was I ready to leave my comfortable life in the Philippines to start over in New York? Not really. What did I know about cooking my husband’s favorite dishes? Honestly, nothing. Was I completely prepared to take charge of a billion-dollar company? I had to find out. In coming face to face with these challenges and opportunities, there was one thing I stood by—live authentically.” *

Join us for this special conversation with Loida Nicolas-Lewis.
