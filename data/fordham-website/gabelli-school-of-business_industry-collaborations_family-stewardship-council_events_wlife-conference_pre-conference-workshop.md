## “The Moore Family Business: A Case Study in Women’s Leadership and Succession”

This interactive workshop uses the *Moore Family Business* case to explore the critical roles women play in family-owned companies, both seen and unseen. From Martha’s decades of steady stewardship, to Jen’s quiet yet essential operational role, to Claire’s bold leadership in sales and succession, participants will see how women’s influence can make or break generational transitions.

Through facilitated discussion, participants will:

- Identify the challenges and opportunities facing women in family businesses before, during, and after succession.
- Explore strategies for amplifying women’s leadership and decision-making voices in governance, ownership, and management.
- Reflect on the dynamics of sibling relationships, spousal roles, and next-generation aspirations in shaping family enterprise futures.
- Take home practical tools to address governance gaps, succession paralysis, and family-business tensions.

We invite you to attend with one or more members of your family business. Together, you’ll gain not only insights into the Moore family’s journey, but also tools to use in your family business. You will leave the workshop better equipped to strengthen relationships, clarify governance, and elevate women’s roles in your family enterprise.

Space is limited to 60 participants.
