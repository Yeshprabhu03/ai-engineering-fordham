![Webinar conference](/media/home/schools/gabelli-school-of-business/gsb-cowebinar-conference-400.jpg)

In an innovative collaboration with the Gabelli School of Business, fashion giant PVH Corp. sponsors faculty research to raise awareness of corporate social responsibility (CSR) as a research area, heighten the visibility of CSR in industry and academia, determine key priorities to foster broad CSR adoption, and spark conversations between academia and practitioners.

- Projects received $30,000 in sponsorship with the prospect of an additional $20,000 if published in a top-tier academic journal
- Winners chosen by a committee of three corporate leaders and academics from five universities
- Recent Gabelli School-PVH grants were awarded for the following projects completed by global scholars: "Offsetting the Disruptive Effects of Organizational Change Through CSR," and "The Future of Environmental Innovation: An Empirical Analysis of Green Patenting".

“This award laid the groundwork for our research agenda on who produces green patents, what they do with these patents, and whether ESG fund flows incorporate information on green patent innovation in their asset allocation.”
