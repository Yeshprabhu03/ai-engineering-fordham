# Emerging Leaders

The Responsible Business Center Emerging Leaders Network seeks to harness the good work of the Fordham Gabelli School alumni network to encourage positive and responsible change in business. Our alumni go on to shape the future of business in incredibly impactful ways, and on a global scale.

The purpose of this community is to consolidate their impact and influence through a common goal: creating a shift towards business for good. Together, members of the Emerging Leaders Network can build long-term value for the Gabelli School and Fordham University, as well as for corporations and individuals around the world. Promoting the Jesuit value proposition of being “men and women for others” doesn’t stop at graduation, and it is the responsibility of the Emerging Leaders Network to ensure that this critical mission is supported—from the classroom to the boardroom.

The Emerging Leaders will host networking receptions and an array of other events throughout the year. Follow the Responsible Business Center on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/fordham-responsible-business-center/?viewAsMember=true) to stay engaged!
