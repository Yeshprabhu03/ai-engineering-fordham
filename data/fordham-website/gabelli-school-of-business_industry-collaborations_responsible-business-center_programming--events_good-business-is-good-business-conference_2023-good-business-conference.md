# 2023 Good Business Conference

## Produced by the Responsible Business Center Fordham University Gabelli School of Business

### April 19, 2023 8:00 a.m. – 2:30 p.m.

**Gabelli School of Business - McNally Amphitheater140 West 62nd Street, New York, NY, 10023 **

*A Consortium of Sustainable Business, Finance and Impact Investing Professionals Exploring the Material Gains and Benefits in seeking measurable social, climate and economic returns*

The Responsible Business Center and the Fordham University Gabelli School of Business believes that there is *Good Business that Comes from Good Business*, that is, that much of the recent public discussion around ESG and corporate sustainability, misses the longer term logical, attainable objectives of business operating for a just and sustainable planet, and profit. Businesses increasingly operate considering all stakeholders: consumers, employees, communities where they operate and investors. This is because it’s logical, *Good Business*, to consider all stakeholders. It’s not just the right thing to do, there’s significant opportunities in business’ transition to positively impacting people and planet.
