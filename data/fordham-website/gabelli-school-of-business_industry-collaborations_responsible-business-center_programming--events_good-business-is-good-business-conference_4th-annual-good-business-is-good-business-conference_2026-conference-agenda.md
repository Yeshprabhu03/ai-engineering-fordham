The Evolution of Innovation and the Customer

Innovation has entered a new phase. As digital systems become more embedded in everyday experiences, customers no longer judge brands by what’s new, but by what actually improves their lives and earns their trust. Expectations for speed, ease, transparency, and responsibility are rising together, reshaping how innovation is experienced across every touchpoint. In this panel, leaders share what’s being embraced, what’s being rejected, and why. They’ll explore how innovation is changing the customer journey, where trust is won or lost, and how organizations can move faster while balancing ambition with responsibility in a world where digital and human experiences increasingly intersect.
