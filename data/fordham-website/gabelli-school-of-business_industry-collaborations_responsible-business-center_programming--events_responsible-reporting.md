# Responsible Reporting

At the Responsible Business Center, we believe that reporting should be more than just compliance; it should be a tool for building trust, transparency, and long-term value creation. That is why we launched the **Responsible Reporting Initiative** which includes a series of events, closed-door roundtables, and workshops designed to explore what it truly means for companies to report responsibly.

The initiative is led by our Executive in Residence, **Marc Siegel**, an experienced leader in corporate disclosure who brings decades of experience shaping the sustainability and financial reporting landscape.

“It seems that the next generation of accountants and business students today often ask about how the work that they do can serve a broader purpose. Maybe this notion of “responsible reporting” can be part of their path. Maybe we can inspire them to consider a future in “responsible reporting”. It can be the place where “rigor” and “responsibility” meet.“
