Marijn van Steenderen is currently an M.S. in Business Analytics student at the Gabelli School of Business. He is originally from the Netherlands, where he successfully earned a master’s degree in Sustainable Energy Technology in addition to a master’s degree in Science, Education, and Communication, specializing in Physics (a teacher’s degree in Physics). He has been interested and engaged in the world’s energy transition for most of his academic and professional career, most notably in solutions other than wind and solar power. This led him to work on the development of a heat battery for residential homes, as well as a hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine for heavy-duty vehicles. Additionally, his experience as a physics teacher led to a year of research on how to integrate the teaching of SDGs into science education. This experience reinforced his belief that sustainability is as much about empowering individuals and communities as it is about advancing technologies. Van Steenderen is inspired by the idea that businesses can be a force for good, fostering partnerships and initiatives that drive social and technological progress. He hopes that the Responsible Business Center Fellowship can help him further envision how businesses can become drivers of sustainable and responsible development.
