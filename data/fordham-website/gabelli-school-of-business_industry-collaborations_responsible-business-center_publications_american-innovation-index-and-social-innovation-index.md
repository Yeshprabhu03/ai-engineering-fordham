**Each year, we showcase the American Innovation Awards at the Annual Good Business is Good Business Conference.**

Across industries, companies that can develop and implement creative solutions, generate new products, and deliver improvements to existing processes, are the ones that are destined for continued success. From airlines and hotels to banks and retail stores, companies that are known for fresh ideas will attract and retain customers.

Established in 2017, The [American Innovation Index](https://americaninnovationindex.com/)® (Aii) scores and ranks the innovativeness of US companies based upon a random sampling of more than 7,000 American consumers. The research conducted and compiled annually for the Aii by Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business, Responsible Business Center, [Radius Insights](https://radiusinsights.com/), and the [Norwegian School of Economics](https://www.nhh.no/en/), is unique in that it measures innovation from the customer point of view rather than relying on expert opinions, which bypass what customers actually experience. *It is the only innovation index to do so.*In addition, the

[Social Innovation Index® (Sii)](https://americaninnovationindex.com/industry-benchmarks/)measures a company’s ability to create positive social and environmental change, and the degree to which it embodies responsible business—also from the consumer perspective.

Using these indices, companies can gain a deeper understanding of how they measure up in the eyes of the consumer, helping them to make business decisions that build customer loyalty, and as a result, increase their value.

The [American Innovation Index](https://americaninnovationindex.com/)® (Aii) is a partner of the [Innovation Index Coalition (IIC)](https://www.nhh.no/en/norwegian-innovation-index/our-partners/), a global collective of academic research partners who are committed to infusing the customer perspective into the discourse surrounding invention and innovation. IIC was founded in 2023 by researchers from The Norwegian School of Economics, and it now includes the following institutions: The Hanken School of Economics (Finland), Karlstad Business School (Sweden), Aarhus University, the School of Business and Social Sciences (Denmark), Hasselt University – School of Business (Belgium), University de Carlos 3 Madrid (Spain), Fordham University Gabelli School of Business (USA), University of Queensland – School of Business (Australia), and VinUni (Vietnam).
