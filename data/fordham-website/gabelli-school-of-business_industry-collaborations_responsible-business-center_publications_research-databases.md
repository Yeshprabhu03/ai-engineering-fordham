# Research Databases

The Responsible Business Center proudly sponsors access to two databases for student and faculty research in ESG.

## S&P Capital IQ

S&P Capital IQ (CapIQ), a platform developed under S&P Global Market Intelligence, provides access to a wide breadth of public company financials and data, including sustainability insights and analytics.

**How to Access S&P Cap IQ**

Log into [fordham.edu](http://my.fordham.edu/) > Research > Fordham Libraries > select *Database*s > type *capital iq* > S&P Global.Advantage

Once you have S&P Global Advantage opened and it has loaded, open a new tab on the browser, go to the [Gabelli only database section](https://fordham.libguides.com/GabelliOnly) and click CAP IQ database.

*Access to CAP IQ accounts, for the time being, must be done within the campus. Access is limited to the University's network. You must be connected to Forham Wi-Fi.*

Once it loads, close the S&P global advantage database and reload the Cap IQ database.

## MSCI ESG Direct Database

MSCI ESG Direct provides the social, environmental, and governance performance of approximately 5,000 companies. Fordham students and faculty can utilize the MSCI ESG Direct database to evaluate a company's social and environmental impacts.

**How to Access MSCI ESG Direct **

Access is available to Fordham Gabelli Faculty and Students by visiting [MSCI ESG Direct](https://fordham.libguides.com/GabelliOnly).
