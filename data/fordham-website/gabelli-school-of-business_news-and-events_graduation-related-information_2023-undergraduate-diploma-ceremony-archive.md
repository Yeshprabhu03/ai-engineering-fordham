The Gabelli School of Business Undergraduate Diploma Ceremony, which occurred directly after the Fordham University Commencement Ceremony on Saturday, May 20, 2023, was a happy occasion despite the rain. Nothing could dampen the spirits of students who had completed four years of work in and outside the classroom, readying themselves for careers across industries or for graduate school. Family members and friends were there to cheer them on.

**Honest Fordham Favorite: **

"Freshman Year, I lived in a converted triple in Loschert Hall. My favorite part about Fordham has been being inseparable from these two random roommates and living together every year since."

**Gabelli Favorite:**

"Gabelli Freshman Orientation is one of my favorite days of the year. It's just a wonderfully warm day with so many new and smiling faces. I have a special affinity for the Orientation I worked at during my Junior Year because it was the beginning of a new chapter."
