# 2023 Awards for Faculty Members Lincoln Center

The Faculty Cura Personalis Award is bestowed upon a faculty member based upon an accumulation of votes cast by students over several years. It speaks to the living out of the Jesuit value to “care for the entire person,” which is demonstrated by a faculty member’s assistance to students in their professional and personal development.

The 2023 Faculty Cura Personalis Award is bestowed upon:

Mark Conrad, J.D. (Business Law and Ethics)

Kenneth Davis, J.D (Business Law and Ethics)
