McCann, advanced lecturer in finance and business economics.

The Dean’s Award recognizes a student who has demonstrated a commitment to the Fordham community and has exemplified the spirit of leadership called forth in a Jesuit education: a leader who unites others behind a common cause to accomplish goals, which could not otherwise be attained.

For 2024, the recipient is Michael Hamlet.

-

The Alumni Chair Award is presented to a senior who inspires their peers, who achieves excellence in intellectual and extracurricular endeavors, and who makes contributions that will outlast one’s time as an undergraduate.

Above all, the Award is presented to an individual who embodies the Jesuit tenets of

*cura personalis*and*magis*, now and throughout their career and lifetime. It also focuses on their commitment to serve as a Fordham Ram for and with others.

The Award—which takes the form of a Fordham captain’s chair—is a symbol of leadership that challenges the recipient to do more. To take up a leadership role in the alumni community as a member of our Young Alumni Committee, or in regional or affinity chapter; to serve as a mentor to future students; and, above all, to become a servant leader among peers and a model of unwavering devotion and service to Fordham.For 2024, this award goes to Brigida Caruso.
