Originally from the Midwest, Grace Maietta is graduating with a B.S. in Marketing with a concentration in Strategic Branding and a minor in Film and Television. During her time at the Gabelli School of Business, she excelled academically through courses within her area of interest, such as Global Sustainability Marketing and Revealing Consumer Insights, but also becoming enthralled with the study of business law and social psychology. She was a member of the Honors Thesis Program, made the First Honors Dean’s List, was a Beta Gamma Sigma and an Alpha Signa Nu inductee, and was a Woolworth Award recipient. In addition, she was both a Manresa Scholar and a Founders Scholar.

Maietta was deeply involved in community work and held leadership roles, serving as co-chair of the Special Events Committee for the Campus Activities Board; co-chair of the Live! at Fordham Committee for Campus Activities Board; and social media administrator and vice president of marketing for the Gabelli School of Business Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Board. She also was a Rose Hill Society undergraduate ambassador, a Gabelli School of Business freshman advising mentor, a Fordham Dance Marathon fundraiser and volunteer, and a Residential Hall Association program coordinator.

On the career front, Maietta interned at The Shark Group, as a strategic partnerships intern; at Warner Bros. Discovery, as a digital distribution intern; and at NBCUniversal, where she completed several internships with different areas of focus.

Maietta credits her time at the Gabelli School with enabling her to learn about the extraordinary power of making strong connections. “Whether it is connecting with classmates to conquer tough material, gaining insights from a dean or professor, or meeting with alumni and industry professionals to discover new opportunities, I have found these exchanges immensely valuable.” She deeply values the personal and professional connections she has made, which have helped her to discover her own strengths and have readied her for a highly successful career.

As a massive sports fan, her dream is to work behind the scenes at the Olympic Games in a capacity that is related to her career path. Beyond that, she hopes to be a successful woman in business who can champion other women as they strive to find their own path to success.
