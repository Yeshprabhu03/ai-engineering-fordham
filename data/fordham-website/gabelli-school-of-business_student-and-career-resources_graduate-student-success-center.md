“In our time at Fordham, we have not only gained a wealth of knowledge and skills, but also have developed a deep sense of purpose. We’ve been encouraged to ask the difficult questions, to challenge the status quo, and to use our education as a tool to make the world a better place.”

Lilianne Liang, recently graduated from the Gabelli School of Business with an M.S. in Business Analytics (MSBA). During her time at the Gabelli School of Business, Liang explored numerous career paths by enrolling in courses in both the M.B.A. program and Fordham Law School. This unique combination of regulatory frameworks, data science, and management piqued her interest, leading her to secure an internship with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) over the summer. Under the mentorship of industry professionals, she gained invaluable insights into the nexus of financial regulations and emerging technologies. After graduation, Liang’s diligence and commitment have been rewarded with a full-time position at FINRA. In her new role as an examiner, she leverages her multidisciplinary expertise to help shape the future of financial regulation.
