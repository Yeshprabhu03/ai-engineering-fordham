Location: [140 West 62nd Street, Suite 126, New York, NY](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7713631,-73.9867173,17z?entry=ttu)

Walk-in advising hours provide the opportunity to visit the Advising Office without an appointment to ask brief questions that may come up. This flexible option is offered on a first-come, first-served basis. Keep in mind, that we support many students and an impromptu visit may require a short wait.

As a walk-in advisee, you’ll have the choice of participating in group advising, during which you can have your questions answered along with other students, or an individual session, which affords you the advantage of a private consultation. While advisors are available during normal advising hours (see above), on occasion, special events or circumstances may affect their ability to meet with you.

If the office hours above do not work for you, contact your advising dean to work out a before- or after-hours appointment.
