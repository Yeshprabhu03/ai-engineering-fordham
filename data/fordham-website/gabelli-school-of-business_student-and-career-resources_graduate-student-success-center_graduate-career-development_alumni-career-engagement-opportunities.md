“The level of candidates that we have brought on board from the Gabelli School into IBM and the different programs (Intern/Co-Op) have been very good candidates, with a number of them transitioning into full-time roles upon graduation. They have the skills, experience, and drive that we look for and have been welcome additions to the team."
