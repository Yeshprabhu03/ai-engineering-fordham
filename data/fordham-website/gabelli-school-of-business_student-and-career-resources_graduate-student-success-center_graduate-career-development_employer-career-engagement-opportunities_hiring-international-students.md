# Hiring International Students

**Understanding Policy and Procedure**

## Facilitating International Hiring

International students at the Gabelli School typically hold [F-1 (academic student)](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/students-and-employment) visas/statuses and in some cases [J-1 (exchange visitor student)](https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/exchange-visitors) visas/statuses.

-
Upon completing one academic year of study at the Gabelli School, international students with an F-1 visa/status are legally allowed to seek full- or part-time internship opportunities as part of the U.S. government’s Curricular Practical Training (CPT). The employer is only required to provide an offer letter outlining the terms of employment, and it is the student’s responsibility to have the CPT authorized by the University.

Thanks to the U.S. government’s Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, students with an


F-1 visa/status in Gabelli School graduate programs can work in the United States for up to 12 months before or after graduation.In addition, F-1 visa/status students who earn a degree in select U.S. government-designated STEM programs may be eligible to apply for a 24-month STEM OPT extension. The following degrees at the Gabelli School are STEM designated

After OPT ends, students will need an

[H1-B visa](https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations-dod-cooperative-research-and-development-project-workers-and-fashion-models)to continue employment at which time employers will need to process paperwork to pursue the H-1B visa sponsorship. Such visas remain valid for an initial period of three years and can be extended once for another three-year period. Sponsoring an H1-B visa is typically a simple and cost-effective process. Contrary to popular belief, the employer does not need to prove attempts were made to recruit U.S. citizens and permanent residents first. -
Graduate students with a

[J-1 visa/status](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/exchange-visitors)have access to work authorization through the University’s academic training program. Employers do not have to file any forms or pay fees on behalf of students with J-1 visa/status, as academic training authorization is granted at no cost by Fordham University’s[Office for International Services (OIS)](https://www.fordham.edu/info/21313/international_services). This process is straightforward for employers; it requires a letter from the employer stating the employer’s name, supervisor’s name, work site address, the student’s dates of employment, position description, and salary.This authorization can be granted for employment before or after completion of the student’s program of study and allows a student to apply knowledge obtained in an academic program to a practical work experience. The employment must be directly related to the student’s field of study.

[OIS](https://www.fordham.edu/info/21313/international_services)will work with employers to ensure that this requirement is met. -

Students can receive up to 12 months of OPT, unless they are in a STEM-designated program, which may qualify them for a 24-month extension of post-completion OPT.
