The Fordham University Gabelli School of Business, Graduate Business Career Development office believes all students should receive compensation for their work, and employers are expected to compensate students for internships by paying the New York City prevailing minimum hourly wage.

**For profit-based organization employers are required to provide compensation.**(1)

[Fact Sheet #71: Internship Programs Under The Fair Labor Standards Act](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/71-flsa-internships)provide general information to help determine whether interns and students working for “for-profit” employers are entitled to minimum wages and overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).(2)

[The New York State Minimum Wage Act and Wage Orders](https://dol.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2021/03/p725.pdf)contain the state’s rules for pay and overtime. These rules are in addition to those required by federal law, including the Fair Labor Standards Act. This is a guideline to help decide if a for-profit business that has interns must pay them according to the state minimum wage and overtime rules.We recognize that

**non-profit organizations**do not always pay their interns, yet they still provide a meaningful learning experience. Therefore, the following**Unpaid Internships Policy & Guidelines**must be followed by**non-profit organizations**to recruit Fordham Gabelli graduate business students for unpaid internships:- For non-profit organizations, students can work without compensation.
- Offering the option of academic course credit is at the employer’s discretion.
- For the employer and career management administrative purposes of posting the internship on the careers portal to advertise the opportunity to eligible students, the compensation field will read as follows, “Unpaid Internship” or “Unpaid Internship for Academic Course Credit.”

-
Employers are prohibited from extending exploding offers, which give a candidate an extremely short window to accept an offer.

-
If a student is taking an unreasonably long period of time to respond to an offer,

[please contact our office](/gabelli-school-of-business/student-and-career-resources/graduate-student-success-center/graduate-career-development/alumni-career-engagement-opportunities/corporate-outreach-and-recruiting-team/)so we may address the issue internally. -
If an employer must withdraw an offer, the employer should

[contact our office immediately](/gabelli-school-of-business/student-and-career-resources/graduate-student-success-center/graduate-career-development/alumni-career-engagement-opportunities/corporate-outreach-and-recruiting-team/). Similarly, if a student reneges on an acceptance of employment, the employer should notify the CDC immediately. Appropriate steps would be taken to review the situation before action is taken. -
Hiring international students requires a slightly greater investment of funds and completion of paperwork than hiring domestic students, but the rewards are worth the additional effort. International students have the advantage of having lived—and sometimes worked—in multiple countries, gaining cultural sensitivity and insights that can be or great value to your business. Their global viewpoint, adaptive skill sets, and ability to often converse in several languages can provide a tremendous advantage for American and multinational companies.

The Gabelli School’s Career Development office offers specialized support for employers who are interested in hiring international students.
