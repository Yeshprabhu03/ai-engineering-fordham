# Graduate Student Events

## Get Into the Groove

Each year, the Gabelli School of Business hosts a series of annual events that are designed to inform and entertain! They provide the opportunity to meet and mingle with those inside our community, as well as those who come to campus to share knowledge and insights about industry trends, career opportunities, and their own experience. Holidays are always a festive occasion here, during which the creativity, camaraderie, and diversity of our study body shines through. Don’t miss out! Check the calendar for upcoming events.
