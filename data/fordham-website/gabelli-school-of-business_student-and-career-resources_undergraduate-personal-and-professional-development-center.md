# Undergraduate Personal and Professional Development Center

## Welcome to the Undergraduate Personal and Professional Development Center.

**When it comes to life after graduation, it's not about getting "a job." It's about starting a career that will define you as a business leader.**

The Gabelli School’s Personal and Professional Development Center helps you reach that goal. What do we mean by “Personal and Professional Development”? At Fordham, undergraduate business students have access to two layers of career-related assistance.

- The Gabelli School’s own Personal and Professional Development Center, known to students as PPD, provides industry-focused preparation tailored for the needs of business majors. PPD services are industry-specific, building on the general foundation provided by Career Services.
[Career Services](https://www.fordham.edu/resources/career-resources/career-center/)is a University-wide office that serves undergraduates in all Fordham colleges and schools. It organizes on-campus recruiting, holds large-scale career fairs, and posts jobs online from companies that are looking to hire from Fordham.

This set of webpages offers an overview of the services and advantages that you, as an undergraduate student, can access through Gabelli School-specific PPD. From here, consider exploring:
