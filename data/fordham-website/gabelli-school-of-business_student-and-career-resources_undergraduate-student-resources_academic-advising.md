# Academic Advising

Planning out four years of college requires a lot of decisions, big and small.

The Gabelli School’s academic advisors are here to help you make them.

Academic advisors—also known as “class deans”—run group workshops and seminars (some of which are required) and offer one-on-one meetings for individual needs. They can assist you with:

- Assessing your personal strengths
- Identifying goals for college and your career
- Choosing courses
- Selecting majors and concentrations

### Advising Philosophy

Undergraduate class deans and advisors help students develop their academic, ethical, personal, and professional talents to propel them on the trajectory of a solid, enlightening, and fulfilling Jesuit education.

We give students the opportunity to look inward and outward: inward with advising and workshops to discover their true vocation; outward with experiential learning, contact with other cultures, internships, and service to discover connections to the workplace.

Gabelli School students are offered a vast array of curricular choices, experiential and service-learning options, international experiences, extracurricular activities, and internship and career possibilities. Advising staff members are committed to helping students understand these opportunities in a compassionate, supportive environment and navigate their four years with us.

Through personal and group interactions, and by listening to students’ concerns and offering curricular and extracurricular advice, we unlock, inspire, and inform students’ talent.

The result is something that is overlooked in most discussions of education: meaningful work. Vocation, or calling, was originally a religious concept that valued work. Whether Gabelli School students want to express their talent by becoming the best accountant or financier, or whether they lean toward social entrepreneurship, we help them achieve their full potential, find their vocation, and enter the world as globally responsible leaders.
