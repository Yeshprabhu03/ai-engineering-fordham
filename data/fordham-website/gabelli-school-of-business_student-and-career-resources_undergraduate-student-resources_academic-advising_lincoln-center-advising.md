## Welcome, newly admitted students

By pursuing your degree with us, you’ll be immersed in the heart of New York City—the global hub of business, media, and the performing arts. Surrounded by diverse museums and a variety of restaurants offering cuisines from around the world, you'll find yourself in a vibrant, culturally rich environment. New York City is a melting pot of people and ideas, offering endless opportunities for cultural exchange.

There’s so much to discover, not only in Manhattan but throughout the city. And when you're ready to explore beyond, New York serves as the gateway to destinations around the world by ship, train, or plane. Together, let’s explore both the world of business and the world around us, as we continue to offer a high-quality undergraduate business education at the Gabelli School on Fordham’s Lincoln Center campus.
