# Sophomore Advising: Using Your Electives

Based on your chosen major or primary concentration, you will have a certain amount of liberal arts and business electives to fulfill. If you choose those electives wisely, in a way in which they aggregate into a critical mass, you may be able to earn an additional credential for your degree — for example, in the form of a secondary concentration or minor.

## Electives

**Business electives**are satisfied by any business course offered by Gabelli. As long as you’ve satisfied any prerequisites, you can take just about any business course, whether it's in accounting, finance, management, business communications or another discipline.**Liberal-arts electives**are satisfied by any class taught by Fordham College (FCRH). Students may take electives in the evenings, but weekend courses do not qualify. Therefore, as long as you've met any prerequisites, you can take just about any liberal arts class, whether it's in anthropology, economics, English, Italian, math, painting, a field of science, and so on.**Free electives**are satisfied by any business or liberal arts elective.

## Minor

Most minors consist of six to seven courses in one particular discipline. Because the core is so extensive, you may be well on your way to a minor without knowing it. (For example, the liberal arts and Gabelli cores get you halfway toward a minor in philosophy and in economics.) You are eligible to pursue a minor in either a business or liberal arts subject.
