# The Fordham Fund

Annual giving through the Fordham Fund is the cornerstone of Fordham’s ability to grow, innovate, and respond to immediate needs.

Every year, Fordham relies on the generosity of alumni, parents, and friends to deliver an education that is both exceptional and accessible. Tuition covers only a portion of the University’s operating costs. Exploring new opportunities, strengthening academic programs, broadening student support services, modernizing campus facilities, and attracting top-tier faculty requires consistent, flexible funding that can be directed to the University’s most urgent needs.

Unlike restricted or endowed gifts, which are designated for specific purposes, annual gifts to the Fordham Fund can be put to use immediately, where they are needed most. That means they meet today’s most pressing needs—funding scholarships, financial aid, and student success—while also giving Fordham the flexibility to invest in its future.

By making a gift to the Fordham Fund, you are supporting:

- Scholarships and financial aid that expand access and equity for students from all backgrounds
- Student life and wellness initiatives that support mental health, career services, and a vibrant campus community
- Academic innovation that enhances curriculum, funding faculty initiatives, and launching new programs
- Mission-driven work that advances our Jesuit values through service, justice, and global engagement

Every gift, every year, matters.
