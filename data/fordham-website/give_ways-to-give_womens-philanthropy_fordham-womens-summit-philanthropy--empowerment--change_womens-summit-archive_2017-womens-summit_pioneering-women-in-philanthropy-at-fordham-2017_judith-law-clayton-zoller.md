# Judith Law Clayton Zoller

**Judith Law Clayton Zoller**, a resident of Port Washington, New York, has been the heart and soul of her late son’s memorial fund. Judy’s second son, Joe Zoller, GABELLI ’87, died tragically on November 5, 2004, at the age of 39. He was a devoted husband, a dear brother to Rich Zoller, FCRH ’85, and a loving son to Judy and her husband, Richard. It is in Joe’s precious memory that the Joseph C. Zoller Memorial Fund was established to provide scholarships to teachers in the Graduate School of Education. Judy spent 36 years teaching first, second, and third grade at Shelter Rock School in Manhasset. She was able to assemble a highly dedicated team of volunteers, including family members and friends of Shelter Rock, for the annual golf outing, which funds the scholarship. The memorial fund has grown to $500,000 and has supported 11 students since its inception.![Judith Zoller pioneering in philanthropy](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/Judith_Zoller.jpg)
