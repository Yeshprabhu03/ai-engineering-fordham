A powerhouse of women rallied at Fordham’s second annual Women’s Philanthropy Summit on October 24 to share ideas about careers, life milestones, and the power of giving.

The all-day summit drew about 250 alumnae, students, faculty, and friends to Fordham Law School for a series of keynote speeches, forums, pep talks, networking breaks, and even a five-minute yoga session. But more than that, it was a chance for them to gather in the same room and discuss something they all had in common: how much Fordham meant to them.

Americans are increasingly identifying as religious "nones." But these women have nevertheless been able to tap into the next generation’s sense of spirituality and social justice.

[Women’s Giving: How Women Accumulate and Distribute Wealth](/give/ways-to-give/womens-philanthropy/fordham-womens-summit-philanthropy--empowerment--change/womens-summit-archive/2018-womens-summit/2018-womens-philanthropy-summit-panel-sessions/womens-giving-how-women-accumulate-and-distribute-wealth/)

Financial literacy is integral to women’s success. In this special keynote panel, four women shared how they turned financial success into a passion for giving back.
