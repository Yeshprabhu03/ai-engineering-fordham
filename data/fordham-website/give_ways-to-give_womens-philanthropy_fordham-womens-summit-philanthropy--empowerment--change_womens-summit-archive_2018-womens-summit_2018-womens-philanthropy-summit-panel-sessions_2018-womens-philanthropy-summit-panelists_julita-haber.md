Julita Haber

Julita Haber is a clinical assistant professor in the communications and media management area at Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business. Her research interests focus on the adverse effects of organizational pressures to appear competent at work. A City University of New York research grant recipient, Haber coined the research term “competency labor” in management, along with publishing other studies. She regularly presents at top scholarly management conferences and is a recipient of two awards for best reviewer as well as the best paper award in the teaching innovation/management education track at the Southern Management Association Conference.

Haber brings 20 years of business and management-consulting experience to her academic career. At Deloitte and PwC, her work involved operations, strategy, financial services, and information technology across the pharmaceutical, biotech, health care, nonprofit, insurance, banking, telecommunication, transport, distribution, and services industries in the United States and the Middle East. Her clients included Prudential, MetLife, Novartis, Macy’s, Bank Leumi, and Staten Island Hospital, among others. She also held the positions of training and development specialist and strategy manager at New York-Presbyterian Hospital for a number of years.

After leaving her native Poland at the age of 15 to live in the United States on her own, she was determined to pursue her education. She received an undergraduate degree in computer science with a minor in mathematics from New York University, followed by a master’s degree from Boston University’s campus in Israel and a doctoral degree in business administration from TUI University. Haber has lived and studied on three continents. Growing up in Europe, working in the Middle East, living in the United States, and traveling around the world to some 50 countries have enabled her to develop a culturally diversified perspective that heightens her students’ global exposure.
