Mary Kate Blaine, FCRH ’00

Mary Kate Blaine is the principal of Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School in Washington, D.C., a post she accepted in 2013. Visitation—an all-girls Catholic high school in the Salesian tradition—serves 500 young women in grades 9 to 12.

Blaine was chief of staff to the superintendent of Catholic schools for the Archdiocese of New York from 2011 to 2013. Previously, she taught government, economics, and U.S. history and served as social studies department chair at Notre Dame School of Manhattan. Throughout her career in education, Blaine has maintained an ongoing relationship with the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History, supporting teacher-training efforts. She is an active member of the National Coalition of Girls’ Schools, where she recently presented at the Global Forum on Girls’ Education on the topic of religious to lay leadership transitions for girls’ schools.

Blaine holds two graduate degrees from Columbia University (an Ed.M. in private school leadership and an M.A. in history and education) and a bachelor’s degree in American studies from Fordham College at Rose Hill. She is currently a mentor for Capital Partners for Education, a nonprofit in Washington, D.C., dedicated to ensuring successful college completion for first-generation college students, and she has supported veterans and spouses through her volunteer work with Hope for the Warriors, a nonprofit supporting military families transitioning from active-duty service to civilian life.
