She received her B.A. from Northwestern University, M.S.W. from Fordham, and Ph.D. from Rutgers University. After joining the faculty at Fordham’s Graduate School of Social Service in 1989, she taught courses in foundation practice, advanced clinical practice, and substance abuse, as well as the Advanced Clinical Integrative Seminar.

Most recently she has been working on a research and mentoring project involving Hispanic adolescent girls. She has published more than 20 articles and several book chapters on these issues.
