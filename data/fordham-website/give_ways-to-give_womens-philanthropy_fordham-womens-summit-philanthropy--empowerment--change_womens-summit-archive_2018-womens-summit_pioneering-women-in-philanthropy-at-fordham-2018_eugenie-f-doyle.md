Eugenie F. Doyle, M.D., MC ’43

Eugenie F. Doyle, M.D., is a retired professor of pediatrics and director of the division of pediatric cardiology at the New York University Medical Center. She began her premed studies at Marymount College and graduated in 1943. She then earned her medical degree from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 1946. She served a 47-year career at NYU Langone Medical Center, directing the pediatric cardiology department from 1958 until her retirement in 1993. Early in her tenure she recognized the value of what was then the daring new open-heart surgery used to save infants with “blue baby syndrome.” In addition to her pioneering patient care and teaching duties at NYU, Doyle authored several seminal papers on children with rheumatic heart disease.

Doyle has served on the board of the Visiting Nurse Service of New York and Visiting Nurse Service of New York Home Care. She is a contributor to the Pediatric Research Foundation and to the Clifford L. Spingarn, M.D., Memorial Education Fund of the New York County Medical Society. Doyle received a College of New Rochelle Centennial Medal in 2004, an honorary doctorate from the NYU School of Medicine in 2005, and an honorary doctorate from Fordham University in 2012. She has also been honored by the Marymount community, receiving both the Gloria Gaines Award and the Golden Dome Award.

With her husband, Joseph, Doyle endowed two scholarships for premed students at Marymount College. When the school closed in 2007, the Doyles generously offered the scholarship funds to pre-health students at Fordham.
