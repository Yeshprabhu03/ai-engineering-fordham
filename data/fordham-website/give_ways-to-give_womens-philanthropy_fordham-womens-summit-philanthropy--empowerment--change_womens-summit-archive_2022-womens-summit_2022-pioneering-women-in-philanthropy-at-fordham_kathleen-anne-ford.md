Kathleen Anne Ford, J.D., FCRH '75, LAW '78, was a member of the first class of women to graduate from Fordham College in 1975. After receiving her law degree, she spent her entire career in public service, including roles at the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office, the Organized Crime Strike Force, the United States Attorney’s Office, the Office of Enforcement Operations at the U.S. Department of Justice, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. She received numerous awards throughout her career, including the Attorney General’s Award for Exceptional Service, the FBI Director’s Letter of Recognition, and the SEC Chairman’s Award for Excellence.

Ford was an instructor at both the National Advocacy Center and the Attorney General’s Advocacy Institute at the Department of Justice, as well as the Benjamin Cardozo School of Law Advocacy Program and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement Complex Prosecutions Program.

She and her husband, Joseph Ford, established the Kathleen Anne Ford, FCRH ’75, LAW ’78, Endowed Scholarship Fund in 2013 as part of their estate planning. In recent years, they have contributed to the fund, resulting in financial support for two students at Fordham College at Rose Hill and two at Fordham Law.
