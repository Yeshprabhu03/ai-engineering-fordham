Principles of equity, inclusion, and belonging are central to [our mission as a Jesuit institution](/about/living-the-mission/diversity-and-inclusion/) and connect us to a long Catholic tradition of advocating for the dignity and worth of every person.

The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences of Fordham University fosters the cultivation of knowledge, wisdom, and a deeper understanding of the human condition. Guided by Fordham’s Catholic and Jesuit traditions, we aspire to prepare students for teaching and leadership in a global society by welcoming learners from a broad array of backgrounds into full participation in scholarly endeavors. In that pursuit, our community strives to treat all individuals with respect, to honor all voices, and to value all contributions.

Our mission is to nurture the potential of each student, alum, faculty, and staff member; to celebrate individuality; and to offer every person the opportunity to lead as well as learn, to educate as well as explore.

To achieve this, here in GSAS, we:

- commit to ensuring that all members of our community, including students, alumni, visitors, faculty, and staff, regardless of their race, color, creed, religion, age, sex, gender, national origin, marital or parental status, sexual orientation, citizenship status, veteran status, disability, gender identity or expression, genetic predisposition, carrier status, documentation status, housing status or any other basis prohibited by law, are treated fairly and experience a learning, research, social, and work environment that is inclusive, supportive, and free from bias.
- dedicate our curricular, recruitment, retention, and organizational efforts whole-heartedly to fostering a safe place and encouraging equity, inclusion, and belonging.
- recognize the importance of connecting these efforts to the integrity of Fordham as a whole, approaching this work both in principle and practice in coordination with all levels and functions of the University.
