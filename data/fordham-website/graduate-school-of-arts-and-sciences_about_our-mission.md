Guided by its Catholic and Jesuit traditions, we aspire to prepare students for teaching and leadership in a global society, by welcoming learners from diverse religious, economic, and cultural backgrounds into full participation in a scholarly endeavor.

As a Graduate School of Arts and Sciences

- We educate its students within the context of liberal studies, in order to enlarge the scope of their inquiries, and to help them perceive the place and use of their work amid the network of all disciplines.

As a graduate school in a Catholic University

- We encourage inquiry into the relation of religious faith to the intellectual, scholarly, and professional lives of faculty and students. Such dialogue is not limited to those who are themselves members of a particular religious tradition.
- We are committed to the humanism of the Catholic intellectual tradition. We emphasize the religious and philosophical traditions that have nurtured the humanities, sciences, and social sciences, in order to encourage exploration of the interactions between reason and faith across the disciplines.

As a graduate school in a Jesuit University

- We welcome students as valued members of the intellectual community through collegial and collaborative interactions. We practice
*cura personalis*, emphasizing respect for each individual and affirming the dignity of each member of the community. - We are committed to rigorous intellectual inquiry that synthesizes the contributions of many disciplines. We seek to go beyond rigid specialization toward an integration of particular specializations into the realm of "wisdom and learning" consistent with the complexities of the modern world.
- We emphasize study not simply for its own sake, but also for service, striving to achieve a balance between study as an end in itself and as a means to other ends. We encourage attention, in all phases of study, work, and life, to the plight of the disadvantaged.
- We draw upon on the world-wide community of Jesuit universities to offer distinctive opportunities for exchange and collaboration. We foster international understanding and respect for other cultures and different peoples.
