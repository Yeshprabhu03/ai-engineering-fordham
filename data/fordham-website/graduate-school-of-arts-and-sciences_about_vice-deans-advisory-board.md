# GSAS Vice Dean's Advisory Board

## Mission

Fordham’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) fosters the cultivation of knowledge, wisdom, and a deeper understanding of the human condition. Guided by its Jesuit traditions, we aspire to prepare students for teaching and leadership in a global society, by welcoming learners from diverse religious, economic, and cultural backgrounds into full participation in the scholarly endeavor.

### GSAS Vice Dean's Advisory Board

The Advisory Board was established to help advance the mission of GSAS. The Board is made up of alumni leaders, parents, and friends who are passionate about GSAS and its students. Invitation to serve on the Advisory Board recognizes an individual’s support of the GSAS commitment to challenge students to fulfill their scholarly potential and prepare them to advance knowledge by their research, transmit it by their teaching, and deploy it productively in their contributions to society.

[Advisory Board members](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/about/vice-deans-advisory-board/members/) serve as advocates and ambassadors for the University. They aid the University with its philanthropic campaigns and help improve career outcomes for GSAS graduates. Through participation at meetings, volunteering, and philanthropic support, committee members demonstrate their leadership on behalf of GSAS and Arts and Sciences at Fordham and gain access to high-level information from faculty and administrators.
