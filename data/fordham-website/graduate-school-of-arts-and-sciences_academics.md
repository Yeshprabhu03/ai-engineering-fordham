# GSAS Academics

Admission to the Ph.D. requires a master's degree. The direct Ph.D. option allows students without a master's degree to be admitted for study toward a Ph.D. degree and to receive the master's degree in curso.

The [Accelerated Master's Programs](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/academics/accelerated-masters-programs/) allow completion of both the bachelor's and master's degrees in five years. This master's degree is limited to those students who pursue their undergraduate work at Fordham, and it will begin during the senior year.

Students applying for the Ph.D. in English, History, Philosophy, or Theology may apply to complete the [Medieval Studies advanced doctoral certificate](https://www.fordham.edu/info/26837/doctoral_certificate_in_medieval_studies).
