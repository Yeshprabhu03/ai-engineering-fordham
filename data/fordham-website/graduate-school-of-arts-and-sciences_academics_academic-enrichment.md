# GSAS Academic Enrichment

The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences offers a variety of academic programs and partnerships designed to help students enhance their critical-thinking skills, broaden their perspectives, and expand their knowledge beyond the experience of a traditional graduate program.

Whether it be through internal, interdisciplinary seminars grounded in Fordham's mission or external partnerships with institutions throughout New York City and around the world, enrichment opportunities empower students to pursue academic excellence, explore new terrain, and develop skills and strategies that will better position them for success in their chosen fields.
