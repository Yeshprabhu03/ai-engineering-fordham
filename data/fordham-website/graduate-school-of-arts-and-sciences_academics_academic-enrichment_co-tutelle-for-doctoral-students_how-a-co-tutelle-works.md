# How a Co-tutelle Works

The fundamental elements of a Co-tutelle involve a doctoral student who, under the terms of an official, signed Co-tutelle agreement and approved plan of study and research, completes the research requirements of the program at both partnering institutions. The doctoral student spends a minimum of one-third (1/3) of the total doctoral research required to complete the degree in residency at each institution, jointly supervised by a dissertation committee comprising of faculty from both Co-tutelle institutions.

**Please note: Eligible Co-tutelle partner institutions may only be those institutions that are not presently accredited in the United States.**

A doctoral student who is approved to enter into a Co-tutelle agreement becomes a matriculated, registered doctoral student at Fordham and the Co-tutelle partner institution, with Fordham University serving as the “home” institution. The Co-tutelle partner institution is considered the “host” institution.

A doctoral student who is approved to participate in Co-tutelle agreements generally:

- is not required to pay tuition to the Co-tutelle institution;
- agrees to defray certain expenses associated with the Co-tutelle, including but not limited to fees charged by the partnering institution; additional health insurance fees; expenses related to travel between the institutions; visa fees; housing and living expenses; and corollary research expenses; and
- may be eligible to continue the GSAS merit-based financial aid for up to one academic year.

Once the terms of the executed Co-tutelle agreement are completed and the doctoral dissertation is defended successfully, the doctoral student will be issued two diplomas—one from each institution—with each carrying a notation indicating that the degree was earned through a Co-tutelle agreement.

The doctoral student agrees to use specific language, as outlined in the Co-tutelle agreement, in the curriculum vita or resumé (or other descriptions of the doctoral student's graduate educational credentials) to describe the nature of the Co-tutelle and the resulting degree.
