# Applicant Letter from Jesuit Pedagogy Organizers

**To:** Senior Teaching Fellows, Teaching Fellows and Teaching Associates**From:** Special Task Force on Jesuit Pedagogy**Re:** Jesuit Pedagogy Seminar for Senior Teaching Fellows, Teaching Fellows and Teaching Associates

We would like to inform you of the Jesuit Pedagogy Seminar that is being offered next semester to Senior Teaching Fellows, Teaching Fellows and Teaching Associates who have taught at the college level at least one year prior to spring 2025. Participating STFs, TFs or TAs should be teaching at least one course during the spring 2025 semester. Participation will include a $4,100 increase to your GSAS academic year merit stipend rate.

Jesuit Pedagogy: Characteristics and practical approaches

This colloquium will expose Fordham graduate students preparing for University teaching to the values and pedagogy that characterize the nearly five-century-old tradition of Jesuit education, and will invite participants to reflect collaboratively on ways that this tradition might serve as a resource for their own educational practices. While it is not assumed that graduate students will be pursuing their teaching careers in Jesuit institutions—so effort will be made to focus on the broad applicability of Jesuit pedagogy—the participants in this project, over the course of the semester, will participate in the large dynamic and history of Jesuit education.

This interdisciplinary colloquium in Jesuit Pedagogy works as a complement to existing training programs in Fordham University Graduate departments. The seminar itself will be limited to approximately 12 graduate student Senior Teaching Fellows, Teaching Fellows or Teaching Associates from diverse disciplines. Entry into the spring 2025 course will be selective.

The spring 2025 colloquium will be team-taught by Professors Michael Baur (Philosophy), Moshe Gold (English), and Christine Firer Hinze (Theology). Enclosed please find a description of the colloquium and an accompanying syllabus. The documents listed in the syllabus will be provided to all colloquium participants.

In addition, we have provided you with copies of the two application forms that STFs, TFs or TAs need to complete and submit.

## Spring 2025 Jesuit Pedagogy seminar information

This special spring 2025 Fordham University graduate seminar has three main overlapping goals:

- an intensive exploration of, and reflection on, the context, history, ideals, goals, and practices of Jesuit education, particularly as they relate to issues of writing and ethics;

- a focused concern to make the principles of Jesuit education a reality in daily interactions between teachers and students and among students themselves;

- an acknowledgement and open discussion of the responsibilities one has to others, especially as these obligations impact the dynamic between teachers and learners.

**Meetings**

There will be [six meetings](#six meetings) over the course of the spring 2025 semester; each meeting will last three hours and will focus on readings, Ignatian Pedagogy and the students’ own teaching. Please note that the last meeting will be conducted as a Forum in which the Graduate students will present material as part of their professional development.

**Mentoring/Class observations/Working together outside the classroom**

In addition to participating in the colloquium meetings and the end-of-the-semester Forum, students will be asked to sit in on classes in multiple disciplines (with the observed classes taught by different instructors). Each Graduate student will also work closely with a mentor, attending a mentor’s classes, grading (duplicate copies of) papers, discussing pedagogical strategies with a mentor, and creating instructive and engaging ways to focus on student writing and ethical concerns (such as academic honesty, the ethics of research, etc.).

**Texts **(for this program, texts will be provided for participants)

Duminuco, SJ, ed. The Jesuit Ratio Studiorum: 400th Anniversary Perspectives. Fordham University Press, 2000. Additional books to purchase on Rhetoric and writing will be announced (texts will include the standard Writing Handbook all Fordham college students own).

**Reading**

Many readings will come from The Jesuit Ratio Studiorum, but there will be supplementary readings from diverse disciplines and fields of inquiry (such as rhetoric, writing, ethics, philosophy, etc.). In addition, to help students become aware of the complex history of Jesuit education, there will be large list of suggested readings on the history and contexts of the Jesuits and Jesuit education.

**Writing**

The students will be asked to write short responses to the readings, the class observations, and the mentoring process. In addition, there will be ongoing written reflections of class discussions and readings. At the end of the semester, students will be asked to present the specific relationships between Jesuit Pedagogy and their particular disciplines. The exact nature of these presentations will be discussed by the class.

[The six meetings: working template]

- Contexts and Histories of Learning. Discussion of students’ experiences (intellectual and affective), societal changes, schools, and teachers. Much of this first class will focus on an acknowledgement of where Ignatian Pedagogy comes from, and an initial foray into the important concepts of “experience, reflection, action, and evaluation” in Ignatian Pedagogy.

In addition, we will use this last session to discuss what needs to be adjusted to create a more effective colloquium for the future.
