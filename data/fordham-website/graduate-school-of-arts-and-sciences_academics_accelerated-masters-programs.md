# GSAS Accelerated Master's Programs

## Earn your master’s degree with only one year of study beyond your bachelor’s degree.

The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) Accelerated Master’s Programs are available to current Fordham College Rose Hill (FCRH), Fordham College Lincoln Center (FCLC), Fordham School of Professional Continuing Studies (PCS), and Gabelli School of Business (GSB) undergraduates.

**Qualified Fordham juniors** may apply for an accelerated master’s degree in select GSAS programs. The accelerated master’s program allows exceptional students to follow a plan to complete both their bachelor’s and master’s degrees in a total of five years (4+1). Fordham undergraduate students apply during their junior (or equivalent) year, and if admitted to the accelerated program, they are eligible to take up to three graduate-level courses in their senior year which will count toward both the bachelor’s and the master’s degree. **No more than three (3) graduate courses, in total, may be taken during senior year. **Upon graduation with their bachelor's degree, students can then complete the M.A. or M.S. degree in one year.

The following accelerated master’s programs welcome applications from eligible candidates:
