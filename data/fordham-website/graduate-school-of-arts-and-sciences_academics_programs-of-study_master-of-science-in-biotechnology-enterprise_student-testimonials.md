**Fawzy Ali**

"I have always believed that meaningful, firsthand engagement with one’s chosen field is essential for developing a deep understanding of its dynamics, for fostering connections with those who share similar professional aspirations, and for envisioning the path one hopes to follow. Attending the Fierce Biotech Congress in Boston was, for me, a profound and transformative experience. It allowed me to witness the biotechnology industry up close, enriching my perspective and strengthening my commitment to the career I aspire to build.

I am sincerely grateful to Fordham University for granting me this opportunity. It has not only broadened my professional horizons but has also contributed greatly to my personal growth. This experience reaffirmed my passion for biotechnology and reminded me of the future I hope to create."
