# GSAS Standardized Test Scores for Admissions

## GRE and English Language Proficiency Exams

**Please note, the GRE requirements for future application years are subject to change.**

Applicants whose native language is not English must meet the requirements and are required to submit scores from the [TOEFL](https://www.ets.org/toefl), [IELTS,](https://www.ielts.org/) [Duolingo English Test](https://englishtest.duolingo.com/) (DET), [PTE Academic](https://www.pearsonpte.com/), or [Cambridge English Qualifications](https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/exams-and-tests/qualifications/) unless they qualify for an exemption.

Fordham’s GRE-ETS school code is** 2259**. No department code is required. GRE scores are valid for five years from the testing date. Any questions about your GRE scores should be directed to [ETS](https://www.ets.org/).

ETS is currently offering a version of the GRE that can be taken at home called the GRE® General Test at Home. For more information, please visit the [ETS GRE](https://www.ets.org/s/cv/gre/at-home/) web page.

Applicants should have official test scores sent by the testing service no later than three weeks before the deadline to ensure timely receipt by published [application deadlines](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/admissions/how-to-apply/application-deadlines/).
