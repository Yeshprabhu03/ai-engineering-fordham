Applicant requirements

Fordham University welcomes applications from international students from around the world. *We strongly encourage international applicants currently residing outside the U.S. to submit their complete applications by the program's earliest *[application deadline](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/admissions/how-to-apply/application-deadlines/)* to ensure ample time for the visa application process.*

### Eligibility to apply

We welcome applicants from all academic and professional backgrounds who have completed or will be completing an undergraduate degree before enrollment in GSAS.

To be eligible for admission consideration, applicants must hold an undergraduate degree (U.S. baccalaureate or equivalent) from an accredited institution before enrollment. For international students, if you have a three-year bachelor's degree from a [member institution](https://ehea.info/page-full_members) within the [Bologna Process](http://www.ehea.info/), you are eligible to apply to GSAS programs. If your institution is not part of this organization, you will need to provide GSAS Admissions with an official course-by-course evaluation of your higher education history by an international credential evaluation company that is a member of [NACES (National Association of Credential Evaluation Services)](https://www.naces.org/) or [AICE (Association of International Credential Evaluators)](https://aice-eval.org/).

### Academic transcripts

Transcripts from previously attended post-secondary institutions must be submitted in English or with a certified English translation. For academic transcripts from institutions outside the United States, applicants are encouraged to obtain a course-by-course credential evaluation. **Exceptions are made for institutions in Canada, Australia, Ireland, and the United Kingdom.** For expedited service in obtaining a course-by-course credential evaluation at a discounted rate from The Evaluation Company (TEC) (formerly Spantran), please complete the [TEC Evaluation Request Form](https://spanside.my.salesforce-sites.com/SpantranApplication?Id=f86a08a0-e8c4-4242-b676-d4476fc8ac79). Other options for credential evaluations include [World Education Services](https://www.wes.org/) and[ Educational Credential Evaluators](https://www.ece.org/), but you may use any service that is a member of the [National Association of Credential Evaluation Services](https://www.naces.org/members) (NACES). Evaluations should be uploaded directly to the application along with the original transcript from the issuing institution.

Exceptions to the transcript evaluation requirement

Waivers of credential evaluations are considered on a case-by-case basis and are not guaranteed. Credential evaluations may be waived provided your transcript meets the following criteria:

- Bachelor's degree from a four-year program
- Transcript written in English
- Includes a comprehensive list of completed courses and credits with grades received for each course
- Contains an explanatory key that clearly describes the grading and credit system used.

Ultimately, whether or not your transcript evaluation requirement is waived will be at the discretion of the Office of Admissions.

All evaluations must be sent **directly from the credential evaluation service to the GSAS Office of Admissions**. We cannot accept copies sent by applicants themselves as official.

If you submit an evaluation before your degree is officially awarded, you will be required—if admitted—to have the evaluation service send us an updated report confirming your degree conferral.

To avoid delays, please arrange for the evaluation service to send your official report directly to our office.** We recommended that applicants have the credential evaluation agency send completed evaluation reports to ****[email protected]****.**

Students admitted with Fordham English Language Test (FELT) condition

The Fordham English Language Test (FELT), administered by Fordham’s Institute of [American Language and Culture (IALC](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/academic-resources/esl/)), may be required for those students whose English proficiency scores do not meet GSAS program requirements. Additional coursework may also be recommended by the IALC.

If you were admitted with a condition that you must take the Fordham English Language Test (FELT), the test is given at the [Institute of American Language and Culture](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/academic-resources/esl/) (IALC) located at 45 Columbus Ave, 3rd Floor, New York, NY 10023. For more information or to schedule a time to take the exam you may email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or call their office at 212-636-6353.

Students are permitted to register for two GSAS courses during the academic term in which they are completing any IALC-recommended coursework, which generally occurs during their first semester of study.

**Please note:** Tuition costs associated with the learning of English as a second language are the responsibility of the student and will not be covered by a GSAS tuition scholarship. GSAS merit-based tuition scholarships are not applicable to the costs of additional coursework recommended by the IALC.

Visa requirements

International students must obtain a [form I-20](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students/prepare/students-and-the-form-i-20) or [form DS-2019 ](https://j1visa.state.gov/participants/how-to-apply/about-ds-2019/)from the [Fordham Office of International Services](/academics/academic-resources/international-services/) in order to apply for an [F-1 Student Visa](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/study/student-visa.html) or a [J-1 Exchange Visa](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/study/exchange.html) from a U.S. Embassy or Consulate. The I-20 is the U.S. immigration document certifying that an F-1 Visa Student has met admission requirements and verified the necessary financial resources to support their studies. The DS-2019 is the equivalent document for J-1 Exchange Visa students. See the [Study and Exchange](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/study.html) section of the U.S. Department of State website for information about visas for study and exchange programs.

** Please note, GSAS Admission does not issue the I-20 and DS-2019 forms. These forms can only be issued by the Designated School Official (DSO) in the Fordham **.

Financial documentation must verify the applicant has adequate financial resources to meet the tuition, fees, and living expenses of the full-time program. (**Note: International applicants accepting an offer of admission as J-1 Exchange Students with an official institutional exchange agreement can obtain an AFCOE specific to the exchange program by contacting GSAS Admissions at [email protected]**.) Any document not in English must be accompanied by a certified translation. Admissions will transfer all uploaded documents to the Office of International Services for processing to issue the SEVIS I-20 or DS-2019.
