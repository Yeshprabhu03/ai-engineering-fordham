# GSAS Fellowships

The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences offers many different fellowship opportunities.

## Distinguished Fellowships

We offer four Distinguished Fellowships.

-
The

[Alumni Dissertation Fellowship](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/financial-support/fellowships/distinguished-fellowships/alumni-dissertation-fellowship/)is the final award an excellent doctoral candidate would receive. The student may apply for this award only after the department has accepted the proposal and the dean has approved the dissertation title and committee. -
The

[Research Fellowship](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/financial-support/fellowships/distinguished-fellowships/research-fellowship/)offers support for students who wish to work closely with faculty mentors to develop their own dissertation research projects or to learn methods or procedures that they will use in their own dissertation research. -
The

[Senior Teaching Fellowship](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/financial-support/fellowships/distinguished-fellowships/senior-teaching-fellowship/)provides support for those students who have already completed a teaching fellowship in the department. Students who have completed a Graduate Teaching Assistantship assignment in which the level of teaching responsibility was sufficient to demonstrate the exemplary nature of the student's teaching ability may also apply. -
The

[Summer Research Fellowship](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/financial-support/fellowships/distinguished-fellowships/summer-research-fellowship/)provides support to students who wish to devote the summer to work on proposals to apply for prestigious fellowships, articles for publication, and conference papers. Recipients of the fellowship are required to present papers at the annual Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Student Research Weekend.

## Mary Magdalene Fellowship with Impact

The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Mary Magdalene Fellowship with Impact award provides support for graduate students who wish to devote a summer to pursuing scholarship and research interests in the area of women in Christianity. Preference will be given to applicants whose scholarship and research interests include women in Christianity; focus on the impact of Christianity and its teachings and structures on women; and/or incorporate the study of Mary Magdalene.
