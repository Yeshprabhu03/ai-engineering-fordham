The Senior Teaching Fellowship (STF) provides support for those students who have already completed a teaching fellowship in the department. Students who have completed a Graduate Teaching Assistantship assignment in which the level of teaching responsibility was sufficient to demonstrate the exemplary nature of the student's teaching ability may also apply.

The application for a Senior Teaching Fellowship must include evidence of teaching effectiveness. Evidence can be provided through the submission of the current teaching evaluation instrument approved by the Arts and Sciences Council (SEEQ). However, recognizing that SEEQs are an imperfect instrument, students may opt instead to submit department evaluations of their service as Graduate Teaching Assistants and/or Teaching Fellows, if available. Departments are encouraged to complete these evaluations for each student at the end of each semester. For updated stipend rates, please see [Stipends and Scholarships](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/financial-support/stipends-and-scholarships/).

**Award Information**

The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Senior Teaching Fellowship provides an academic year stipend and tuition scholarship. For programs based on 12-month financial aid packages, a 12-month stipend is provided. For updated stipend rates, please see [Stipends and Scholarships](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/financial-support/stipends-and-scholarships/). Responsibilities of Senior Teaching Fellows include teaching two courses per year at Fordham College under faculty supervision.

**Eligibility**

Doctoral students in good standing with satisfactory academic progress according to the guidelines established by Fordham GSAS are eligible for this award. A student may apply for only one of the three academic-year financial aid awards for advanced students (Research Assistantship, Senior Teaching Fellowship, or Alumni Dissertation Fellowship). Each of these awards can be held only once by a student, except for students enrolled in the Doctoral Certificate in Medieval Studies, who can hold a second STF. A student may apply for a Summer Fellowship. Funds must be used to assist in the student's progression toward completion of degree.
