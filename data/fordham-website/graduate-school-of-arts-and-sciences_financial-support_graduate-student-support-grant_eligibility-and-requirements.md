# SSG Eligibility and Requirements

## Eligibility

All students matriculated in a GSAS degree program; who are in good academic standing (please refer to §7.4.1 and §7.4.2 in the [GSAS Academic Policies and Procedures Guidebook](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/gsas/resources/handbook/?_ga=2.82385686.1851775976.1604595066-1580982007.1573919002) for details); and who have paid their GSC student fees are eligible to apply.

- an updated resume or curriculum vitae, preferably the latter
- Students should include the name of a Fordham faculty member who the Committee can contact if there are any clarifying questions that arise regarding the proposal

- fulfill all award requirements, within the confines of the approved and funded project proposal
- submit accurate and complete reimbursement documentation in a timely fashion

(within 30 days of expenses being incurred or receipt of the award) - be willing to serve as a future SSG Selection Committee member
