# SSG Frequently Asked Questions

-
Students may only apply for one funding track in the same SSG award cycle, but past practice has been that students can apply twice to the same track. If your proposal appears to fit within multiple tracks, please apply for the track that best fits your proposal. If you apply twice to the same track, you are strongly encouraged to designate which application is the “primary” application because one application will be designated secondary and funded only on the condition that funding is available after decisions are made on other applications.

-
The University will only reimburse the party that made the payment to the vendor. For example, if you share the cost of renting a car with another student, only the student that paid the rental car agency can be reimbursed (with proper expense documentation). The University will not reimburse you for the amount that you reimbursed the other student.

-
You can share the cost of a hotel room with another individual; however, the University will only reimburse the individual whose name and credit card information are listed on the hotel bill. Please arrange with your hotel to split the charges in advance of checking-in.

-
No. The SSG will not reimburse students for per diem related expenses; there is no set amount per day. Instead, itemized receipts of the actual expenses must be provided.

-
The University will reimburse the cost of gas for filling a rental car as long as you present a copy of the receipt. For the use of personal vehicles, the University will reimburse based on the IRS standard mileage rate found on the

[IRS website](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-issues-standard-mileage-rates-for-2022); for 2022, this amount is 58.5 cents a mile. To request reimbursement, provide a screenshot/copy from an online map showing the mileage to/from your destination. -
Approved expenses that are paid in a foreign currency must be converted to U.S. dollars when completing your reimbursement form. For expenses paid using cash, please retain your original receipt and convert the foreign currency expenditure into U.S. dollars using the

[Oanda Currency Converter](https://www.oanda.com/currency/converter/). A print out of the rate provided by Oanda is also required. For expenses paid using your credit card, please provide a copy of your statement showing the conversion rate and U.S. dollar equivalent charge as applied by your credit card provider. -
The University requests that you ask the vendor to fill out a W-9 form.

-
Processing takes approximately 3-5 weeks, though we at GSAS/GSC try to speed this along and get the documents to Accounts Payable as soon as possible. Once it is in that office, we are not privy to the processing time and we have seen it be variable over the last several years. Please be sure to reach out to us or their office with questions.

-
Students may apply for support during either or both funding cycles (fall, spring); however, priority will be given to applicants who have not received support in the immediate past funding cycle.

-
You can share the cost of a hotel room with another individual; however, the University will only reimburse the individual whose name and credit card information are listed on the hotel bill. Please arrange with your hotel to split the charges in advance of checking-in. To reimburse an individual other than yourself, please provide their name, FIDN (if Fordham student) or W-9 form (if a non-student), and the hotel receipt showing payment. The same applies to Airbnb and other lodging options. Venmo receipts to the student who paid for lodging are NOT acceptable for reimbursement (please contact Accounts Payable for more guidance on this kind of transfer).

-
Provide a bank statement showing the last four digits of the card/account as well as the transaction (you may black out non-relevant information). The dual “receipt and bank/card statement” requirement for proof of purchase and reimbursement is common in many industries for reimbursement and is done for auditing purposes.

-
Any GSAS student (M.A., M.S., Ph.D.) may only apply for one funding track in the same SSG award cycle. If your proposal appears to fit within multiple tracks, please apply for the track that best fits your proposal.

-
The University will only reimburse the party that made the payment to the vendor. For example, if you share the cost of renting a car with another student, only the student that paid the rental car agency can be reimbursed (with proper expense documentation). The University will not reimburse you for the amount that you reimbursed the other student.

-
Generally, no, the University will not reimburse individuals for travel expenses until after the date of travel. If you are struggling financially, we may be able to assist in booking advance airfare through Fordham, given you have already received your SSG award letter.

-
We recommend NOT trying to bring your materials to any office. Unless approved otherwise, please submit all reimbursement requests digitally.
