[SSG Fact Sheet](/media/home/schools/graduate-school-of-arts-sciences/pdfs/SSG-Fact-Sheet.pdf) | [SSG Assessment Guidelines and Rubric](/media/home/schools/graduate-school-of-arts-sciences/pdfs/SSG-Assessment-Guidelines-and-Rubric.pdf)

The SSG is a competitive, merit-based grant designed to support GSAS students engaging in scholarly or professional development activities. Proposals for award support should demonstrate a student’s commitment to professional development above and beyond their program’s requirements.

This would include, but is not limited to, attending conferences to present their research, make connections with others in the profession, or advancing their career as well as research and activities that improve scholarship or advance career prospects. In AY 2023-2024, most proposals were partially funded.

Three types of funding tracks are available:

## Conference Participation

Presentation of an applicant’s research (e.g. paper or poster presentations) or attendance at a national or international professional conference.

**Award Limits**

- Conference participation ($1,500 domestic, $2,000 international)

## Research

Research activities related to either an applicant’s thesis; preparation of a dissertation prospectus; or the dissertation project, where the objective is to distinguish the dissertation in its field nationally or internationally, and/or to increase the competitiveness of an application for external funding.*

**Award Limit**

- Limit of $2,000

## Alternative Learning Experiences

Activities that will aid meaningfully in strengthening an applicant’s research or professional competencies, but which are not tied to the same types of conference participation or research activities as outlined above.

**Award Limit**

- Limit of $2,000

*Proposals that require Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) review (e.g. involving human or animal subject research) must include confirmation of IRB or IACUC approval. Where compensation for individuals recruited to participate in IRB-approved research is requested, please be sure to provide a detailed rationale for all proposed costs, as some may not be eligible for reimbursement under the SSG framework.
