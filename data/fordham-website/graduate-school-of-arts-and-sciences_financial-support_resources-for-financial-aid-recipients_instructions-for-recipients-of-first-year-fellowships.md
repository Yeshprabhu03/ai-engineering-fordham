# GSAS Instructions for Recipients of First-Year Fellowships

Congratulations on being a Fellowship recipient and welcome to Fordham’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Fellowships are considered a form of GSAS financial aid. We want you to know that our doors are always open to answer any questions regarding fellowships and other forms of financial aid. If you have questions, please contact us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4223262531233102242d30262a232f6c272637).

Please read the following instructions very carefully to make sure that we can process your fellowship in a timely fashion. Please also note that you may not accept any employment within the University while holding GSAS financial aid without the written permission of the Dean.

**Stipend**

Your fellowship is designed to foster your professional development through an individualized program of research, study, and teaching preparation. The stipend will be paid through the Fordham University accounts payable department. You should consult a qualified financial advisor with any questions about taxation. While on fellowship, you are required to be a full time student.

Fellowship payments are disbursed by Fordham University’s Accounts Payable department. To sign up for ACH direct deposit payments, please contact [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0160656672607241676e736569606c2f646574) for the ACH form.

**Tuition**

Please note that you should be in contact with your program director to receive guidance on which courses you should be taking. After consulting with your program director, you should register by the deadline indicated in the [GSAS Academic Calendar](https://go.activecalendar.com/FordhamUniversity/site/academic/?&ql=y&search=y). We will post your tuition award to your student account shortly after the registration deadline. If you make changes to your registration after the registration deadline, it is very important that you email us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2544414256445665434a57414d44480b404150) to let us know, so that we can adjust your scholarship accordingly.

**Billing**

The E-Bill Suite is an integrated e-bill and e-payment web portal, which provides students the ability to review their account activity in real-time and make an electronic check payment towards a student account.

Students can access their E-Bill Suite via a single sign-on through the main [fordham.edu](https://www.fordham.edu/) homepage.

- Log in to the New Portal
- Under "My Pages" click the 'Students' tab
- Click "My Account"
- Click "Student Account"
- Click "My E-Bill Suite" under Account Overview. This will link to the secure E-Bill website.

This will link to the secure E-Bill website. Once in your E-Bill suite, select "My Account", then select "Statements". You can also invite authorized users to access your E-Bill Suite account.

If you have any questions about your bill or scholarship, first please review your E-Bill on [fordham.edu](http://my.fordham.edu/) for your real-time balance. If you have questions about the E-Bill, you must notify us promptly by emailing us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5637323125372516303924323e373b78333223).

**Full-time Status**

As a GSAS financial aid recipient, you are required to maintain full-time status. If you register for fewer credits than your program requires (e.g., because you are preparing for comprehensive exams or doing other non-credit academic work), you must file a [Matriculated Student Status Certification Form](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/student-resources/forms/matriculated-student-status-certification/). All student forms can be found on the GSAS website [Student Forms](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/student-resources/forms/) page. Failure to file this form each semester that you are registered for less than full time may result in problems with loan deferments, posting of your tuition scholarship, and federal financial aid eligibility. You must be attending your program full-time and doing work equivalent to full time to be certified as full-time.
