# GSAS Instructions for Recipients of Graduate Assistantships

GSAS financial aid, such as graduate assistantship and fellowship stipends, is administered by the GSAS Office of the Academic Operations and Support. We look forward to welcoming you to Fordham; in the meantime, you may contact us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5a3b3e3d293b291a3c35283e323b37743f3e2f).

Please also note that you may not accept any employment within the University while holding GSAS financial aid without the written permission of the Dean.

**Stipend**

Stipends issued to graduate assistants are processed through the Fordham University Office of Payroll. Consequently, if you are a first-time graduate assistant, you must complete all of the required payroll paperwork (linked below) before your stipend can be processed. The completed forms and original documents must be emailed to the Office of Academic Programs and Support at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Please look for an email from [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c9a8adaebaa8ba89afa6bbada1a8a4e7acadbc) during the month of July with detailed instructions.

**Tuition**

Please note that you should be in contact with your program director to receive guidance on which courses you should be taking. International students with ESL registration holds are permitted to register for two (2) courses prior to passing the ESL exam. After consulting with your program director, you should register by the deadline indicated in the [GSAS Academic Calendar](https://go.activecalendar.com/FordhamUniversity/site/academic/?&ql=y&search=y). We will post your tuition award to your student account shortly after the registration deadline. If you make changes to your registration after the registration deadline, it is very important that you email us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) to let us know, so that we can adjust your scholarship accordingly.

**Billing**

The E-Bill Suite is an integrated e-bill and e-payment web portal, which provides students the ability to review their account activity in real-time and make an electronic check payment towards a student account.

Students can access their E-Bill Suite via a single sign-on through the main [fordham.edu](https://www.fordham.edu/) homepage.

- Log in to the New Portal
- Under "My Pages" click the 'Students' tab
- Click "My Account"
- Click "Student Account"
- Click "My E-Bill Suite" under Account Overview. This will link to the secure E-Bill website.

This will link to the secure E-Bill website. Once in your E-Bill suite, select "My Account", then select "Statements". You can also invite authorized users to access your E-Bill Suite account.

If you have any questions about your bill or scholarship, first please review your E-Bill on [fordham.edu](http://my.fordham.edu/) for your real-time balance. If you have questions about the E-Bill, you must notify us promptly by emailing us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4627222135273506202934222e272b68232233).

**Full-time Status**

As a GSAS financial aid recipient, you are required to maintain full time status. If you register for few credits than your program requires (e.g., because you are preparing for comprehensive exams or doing other non-credit academic work), you must file a [Matriculated Student Status Certification Form](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/student-resources/forms/matriculated-student-status-certification/). All student forms can be found on the GSAS website [Student Forms](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/student-resources/forms/) page. Failure to file this for each semester that you are registered for less than full time may result in problems with loan deferments, posting of your tuition scholarship, and financial aid eligibility. You must be attending your program full time and doing work equivalent to full time to be certified as full time.
