# GSAS Teaching Associateships

The rank of teaching associate designates those graduate students, other than teaching fellows (see [§8.4 in the GSAS Academic Policies and Procedures Guidebook](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/gsas/resources/handbook/funding/#text)), who serve as instructors for undergraduate courses in Fordham College Rose Hill, Fordham College Lincoln Center, and Professional and Continuing Studies.

- Eligible matriculated students in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences may serve as teaching associates, but they may under no circumstances serve as adjunct instructors. The teaching associate assignment is part of disciplinary and professional training..
- Teaching associates will receive a per-course stipend, a tuition scholarship of up to three credits per semester, and a contribution towards health insurance. No teaching associate may teach more than two courses per semester.

In order to be considered for a teaching associate position, students must apply for funding.

- Teaching associates must have completed the master’s degree (with preference to students who have completed all requirements except the dissertation proposal and defense), be in good academic standing (in both academic performance and in academic progress; see
[§8.2 in the GSAS Academic Policies and Procedures Guidebook](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/gsas/resources/handbook/funding/#text)), and must complete the Application for Financial Aid. - Nominees must have completed their department’s teaching preparation program (where such exists).
- Preference for appointment as a teaching associate is generally given to students who have successfully served as teaching fellows, and who will have exceeded the normal award tenure for funding.
