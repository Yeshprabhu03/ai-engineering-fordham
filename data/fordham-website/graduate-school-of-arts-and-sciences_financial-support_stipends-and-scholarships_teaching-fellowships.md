# GSAS Teaching Fellowships

Some students receiving financial aid are selected by their academic departments to be instructors for undergraduate courses in Fordham College Rose Hill, Fordham College Lincoln Center, and Professional and Continuing Studies, under the supervision of a faculty member, and are designated as teaching fellows. Teaching fellows should spend no more than 18 hours per week on duties related to their teaching fellowship.

Teaching fellows are typically advanced doctoral students who have completed all coursework and passed the doctoral comprehensive examinations.

Most departments require that applicants for teaching fellowships successfully complete a teaching seminar or that they participate in ongoing instructional development. All teaching fellows are expected to attend the orientations jointly sponsored by the deans of Fordham College Rose Hill, Fordham College Lincoln Center and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

Teaching fellows must follow the Fordham college deans’ instructional policies as outlined in the [Undergraduate Faculty Handbook](https://www.fordham.edu/info/24145/undergraduate_faculty_handbook).
