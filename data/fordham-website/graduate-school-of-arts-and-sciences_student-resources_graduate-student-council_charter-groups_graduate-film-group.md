# GSAS Graduate Student Council Graduate Film Group

The Graduate Film Group aims to connect graduate students with a passion for cinema. We screen acclaimed films and create a space for discussion and critical engagement with each film we watch. We also want to keep our members up to date on exciting opportunities in NYC's diverse and active film world!
