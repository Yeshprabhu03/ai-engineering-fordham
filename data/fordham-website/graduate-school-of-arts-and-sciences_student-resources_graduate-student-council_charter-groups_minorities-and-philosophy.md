# Minorities and Philosophy

**Minorities and Philosophy (MAP)** at Fordham aims to address structural injustices in academic philosophy, working to dismantle barriers that prevent the full participation of individuals from marginalized groups. By promoting diversity and inclusivity, MAP seeks to foster a more equitable environment in philosophy, both at Fordham and within the broader academic community. This mission aligns with the larger international MAP network’s commitment to challenging the mechanisms that exclude underrepresented groups from the discipline and improving the conditions for scholars from these backgrounds.
