# GSAS Graduate Student Council Excellence in Graduate Teaching Award

The competitive Excellence in Graduate Teaching Awards recognize the significant contribution of graduate student instructors and teaching assistants to the education of Fordham’s undergraduate community. Previous winners of the award have come from various departments, including Philosophy, English, History, Theology, and Psychology. You could be next!

Every year, the winners of the Excellence in Graduate Teaching Award receive a monetary prize; we have had up to three winners in a given year. Recently, we have also given out an honorable mention award to anywhere between two and four recipients. Both Graduate Instructors and Teaching Assistants are eligible to apply as we understand that teaching designations can vary across departments. If you are unsure if you qualify, please do not hesitate to contact us at

These awards will be given to instructors and teaching assistants who demonstrate high-quality teaching, as evidenced by their stated teaching philosophy, a faculty recommendation (preferably based on observations of the student’s teaching), a CV, and course evaluation (SEEQ) scores. Please see "
