## Policies and Procedures

As employees of Fordham University, Graduate Student Workers (GSWs) should be familiar with policies outlined in the [Fordham Employee Handbook](/human-resources/policies-guides-and-agreements/employee-handbook/). (Please note that not all sections apply). In addition, those GSWs teaching undergraduate courses (e.g. Teaching Fellows, Senior Teaching Fellows, Teaching Associates) should familiarize themselves with Fordham's [Undergraduate Handbook](/resources/policies/undergraduate-faculty-handbook/).

Although the [GSAS Academic Policies and Procedures Guidebook](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/gsas/resources/handbook/?utm_source=SilverpopMailing&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Fordham%20Policies%20and%20Employee%20Handbook%20to%20instructional%20staff%20(1)&utm_content=) contains information relating to academic matters, several sections are also relevant to employment (e.g. Section 8 on funding and tuition scholarships).

General University policies covering a range of issues may also be found on the [Policies](/resources/policies/) page of the university website.

The [HR Policies and Agreements](/human-resources/policies-guides-and-agreements/) page is also a useful resource. Here you can find the [Reasonable Workplace Accommodation policy](/human-resources/policies-guides-and-agreements/reasonable-workplace-accommodation-policy/), alongside other policies, guides, and agreements governing employment at the university. A [MyTime video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaFsqzY4BCw&feature=youtu.be) provides instructions on how to use the leave tracking system.

Many Graduate Student Worker positions are determined to be union-eligible and must be compliant with the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. If your position is union-eligible, a requirement of your position will be to either join the union, or opt out and become a fair share payer. After joining the union, you are covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). **Please read through the terms of the CBA between Fordham University and the Communication Workers of American Union, Local 1104. You can find the link to the CBA in the important links section below. Please note that you need to log in to view the agreement. **

### Job Opportunities

Job postings for graduate students can be found on the [GSAS Job Opportunities](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/student-resources/professional-development/job-opportunities/) page. The post will remain on the website for a minimum of ten days.

The 2025 - 2026 hourly rate for GSAS students is:

- Master's Students - $20.70/hour
- Doctoral Students - $24.00/hour

### Medical Leave of Absence for GSWs

GSWs who hold a dual role at Fordham University (student and employee) need to inform the Office of Human Resources Management and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, as soon as possible, of their need for medical leave.

GSWs should also contact their DGS to inform them that they need a leave of absence, and subsequently email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#93f2f7f4e0f2e0d3f5fce1f7fbf2febdf6f7e6), [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5d3a2e3c2e313c3f322f2f38313c293432332e1d3b322f39353c3073383928)[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c2aea7a3b4a7afa3aca3a5a7afa7acb682a4adb0a6aaa3afeca7a6b7) for guidance on applicable processes.

GSWs are not required to disclose private medical information to their DGS.

[Here](/human-resources/benefits/leave-and-disability/) is the HR link for employment-based leave.

[Here](/student-life/deans-of-students-and-student-life/important-policies/mental-health-and-medical-related-re-entry-process/) is the link to the Re-Entry Team website, which is the team that administers university academic medical leave (similar info is available on the medical leave request form).

You can find more info regarding requesting leave in [this section](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/gsas/resources/handbook/enrollment/#text) of the guidebook (5.1.3).

### GSW Emergency Relief Funds (Union members only)

Emergency Relief Funds are available to GSWs who face an unexpected, urgent situation that threatens academic progress and causes financial hardship. These funds are intended to mitigate costs that are not otherwise covered by fellowships, grants, loans, or personal resources.

Two separate funds are available, one for all GSWs and one solely for international GSWs. Applications are reviewed by an independent Emergency Relief Fund Committee on a rolling basis. Applicants will be notified by email of the Committee’s determination.

Please note: all applications must be for a reimbursable expense and must be accompanied by statements or receipts.

The maximum award available for the **GSW Emergency Relief Fund is $300**. The maximum award for the **International GSW Emergency Relief is $500**.

For examples of eligible and ineligible expenses please refer to the [Examples of Eligible and Ineligible Expenses](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/student-resources/gsas-at-work/examples-of-eligible-and-ineligible-expenses/) page.

**When submitting your application please include an ITEMIZED BUDGET, INCLUDING RECEIPTS.**
