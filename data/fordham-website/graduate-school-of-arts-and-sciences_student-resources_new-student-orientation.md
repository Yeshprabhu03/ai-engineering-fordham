Welcome to the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) at Fordham University! We are excited to have you join our incoming class of graduate students for fall 2025 and look forward to supporting you throughout your time here.

We have designed a New Student Orientation with a schedule of events that will deliver essential information to new graduate students through in-person and virtual sessions.

**Note:** Orientation is exclusively for new, incoming students (due to space limitations, we are unable to accommodate family, partners, children, etc.).

At new student orientation, staff members and fellow students from several Arts and Sciences programs will introduce you to resources, programs and services that will help you make the most of your Fordham experience.
