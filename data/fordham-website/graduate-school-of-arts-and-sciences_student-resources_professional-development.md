# Professional Development Opportunities at GSAS

Our mission is to enhance the academic experiences and quality of life for the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences’ students pursuing advanced degrees.

In order to do so, we are committed to:

- Cultivating a community of integrated learning in which we promote an education that is student-centered, emphasizing the individual and the development of the whole person
- Assessing and addressing the distinct and diverse needs of the graduate student population with a particular focus on academic and professional development
- Creating an environment in which the presence and contributions of graduate students are recognized, valued, and celebrated
- Fostering collaborative relationships across departments, programs, and divisions

Building a community of graduate students takes each individual’s participation and commitment. Here, we encourage our students to explore the following resources and get involved in the graduate community.
