# GSAS Career Development

It is important to consider your interests, what you enjoy, what is important to you and your values when choosing the right career. To help you to do this, think about:

- Your actual, preferred and potential personal strengths (qualifications, abilities, aptitudes, practical skills, personal qualities and physical strengths);
- Limitations to the above and commitments (personal/time/money etc...);
- Personal needs, satisfactions, aspirations, and your most valued experience.
