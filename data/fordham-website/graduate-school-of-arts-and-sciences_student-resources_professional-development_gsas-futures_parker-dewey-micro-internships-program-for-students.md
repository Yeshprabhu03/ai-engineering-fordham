# Parker Dewey Micro-Internships Program for Students

GSAS Futures wants to support our graduate students amidst the difficult circumstances presented by COVID-19. In this effort we would like to encourage you to apply for a micro-internship through the Career Services micro-internship portal: a unique, paid professional development opportunity with alumni and employers from a wide variety of different professions. Micro-internships give GSAS students the chance to grow their professional networks, expand their industry knowledge, develop their skills and receive an on-the-ground introduction to careers that interest them.

Employers offering micro-internships have designed projects that can be accomplished remotely, and are therefore suitable for students seeking professional development opportunities amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Students are encouraged to explore the professional possibilities of micro-internships whenever they feel the time is right on their professional journeys.

**What is a micro-internship?**

Micro-internships are short-term, paid, professional assignments that are similar to those given to new hires or interns. These projects enable students and recent graduates to demonstrate skills, explore career paths, and build their networks as they seek the right full-time role. Unlike traditional internships, micro-internships can take place year-round, typically range from 5 to 40 hours of work, and are due between one week and one month after kick-off. Micro-internships are used by companies ranging from those in the Fortune 100 to emerging start-ups, and go across departments including sales, marketing, technology, HR, and finance.
