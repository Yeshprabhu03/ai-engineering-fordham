Our key goal at GSAS Futures is to put together workshops, events, and panels that will help graduate students maximize their academic and professional potential.

This semester, Futures is hosting a number of events with various co-sponsors. In addition, the list below features professional development events being held by other university-wide offices that are relevant to our student's needs.

Details of future events are updated as needed.
