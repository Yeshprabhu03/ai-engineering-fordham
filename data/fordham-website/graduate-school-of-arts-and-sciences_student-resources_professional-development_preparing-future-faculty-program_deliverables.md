# GSAS Preparing Future Faculty Deliverables

The PFFI program prepares participants for the academic job market by developing and workshopping application materials, conducting mock interviews, and learning how to market and tailor their specific skill sets to different institutions.

To complete the program, participants must fulfil the following requirements by the assigned deadline (refer to the syllabus):

-
Faculty applications generally consist of four integral documents: CV, Teaching Philosophy, Research Philosophy, and Diversity Statement. Each of these documents is a chance for the candidate to showcase their skills, goals, and ideologies that will accompany their faculty career.

- CV
- Teaching Statement
- Research Statement
- Diversity Statement

-
Participants will use their digital portfolio (website and/or LinkedIn) to share their application material, their CV, any publications, manuscripts, media mentions, pedagogical materials, etc. Candidates are free to choose their own modality for their digital portfolio. Suggested hosts include Google Sites, Wix, Weebly.

-
For our in-class workshop sessions, we will upload our draft to a shared Google folder (refer to the syllabus) at least two/three days ahead of our workshop meeting. Everyone should comment on their peer’s draft (three comments per draft minimum, or just one substantial end comment, keep it professional and respectful) before we meet to discuss.

-
Candidates final deliverable will be participating in a full mock faculty interview. Participants must email their completed application portfolio (revised drafts of CV, Research, Teaching, and Diversity Statements) to

[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9aeafcfcdafcf5e8fef2fbf7b4fffeef), before participating in their mock Zoom interview. Following the mock interview, participants will receive feedback from the committee on their material and interview.
