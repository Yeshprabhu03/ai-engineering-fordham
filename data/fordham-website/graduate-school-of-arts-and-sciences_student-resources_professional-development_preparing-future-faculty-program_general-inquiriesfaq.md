## Frequently Asked Questions

**What is the deadline to enroll in the PFF program?**

The call for applications is typically announced in late summer or early fall. The program commences in late September, so the enrollment deadline falls sometime around mid-September. Departmental approval from your DGS, ACGS, or Departmental Chair is required before joining the program.

**What do I get for finishing the program?**

Fordham prides itself on providing excellent pedagogy training. By participating and completing the PFF Program, you can add a line to your CV indicating that not only are you ready to teach in a classroom, but that you have educated yourself above and beyond already high standards. You will also receive a Certificate of Completion.

**I am a Master's student at Fordham. Can I participate in the program?**

At the moment, only Ph.D. students are eligible to participate in the PFF Program. However, M.S. or M.A. students are welcome to participate in PFF programming sponsored by GSAS, which is open to all students. Some meetings or departmental training may be specific to Ph.D. student needs and interests, however.

**I think I’ve completed all the requirements. How do I finish and get my Certificate of Completion?**

To complete PFFI, students must attend the majority of the synchronous events and complete required activities to receive their official PFFI Certificate of Completion: which includes developing an online portfolio, completing class observations, developing and workshopping job market material, and attending mock interviews. It is encouraged for students to meet with a departmental mentor to review that portfolio and discuss their progress. If you are not sure who your PFFI department contact is, please email the PFFI organizers at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5222343412343d20363a333f7c373627).

**Given my busy schedule, balancing teaching, research, and other ****responsibilities related to my Ph.D., how frequently am I required to attend the ****PFF events, and what is the time commitment for completing the associated ****tasks?**

Keeping in mind the busy schedule of our graduate students, we have designed the PFFI program to prioritize maximum delivery with minimal contact hours. We meet bi-weekly for an hour (mostly over Zoom) to discuss topics that are carefully selected to support your academic job search process more robustly. In other words, PFFI prepares participants for the academic job market by developing and workshopping application materials, conducting mock interviews, and learning how to market and tailor their specific skill sets to different institutions.
