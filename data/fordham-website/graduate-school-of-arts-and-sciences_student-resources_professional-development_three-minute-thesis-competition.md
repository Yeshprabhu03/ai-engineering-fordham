**Think you have what it takes to present your research and its significance in three minutes?**

Open to all students enrolled in a GSAS master’s or doctoral program, the [Three Minute Thesis (3MT ®)](https://threeminutethesis.uq.edu.au/) is a research communication competition developed in 2008 by The University of Queensland in Australia.

The premise of the competition is to develop academic, presentation, and research communication skills. 3MT® supports the development of students’ capacity to explain effectively their research in language appropriate to an intelligent but non-specialist audience.

Contestants have three minutes to present compelling orations on their thesis or dissertation research, and its significance and value. One PowerPoint slide is required with no animation permitted.

3MT® is not an exercise in “watering down” research; rather, it forces students to consolidate their ideas and concisely explain their research discoveries.

Be inspired -- watch 3MT® presentations from past competition winners!

If you are a current student interested in participating, please review the competition eligibility and rules, training materials, and judging criteria. For more videos and information about the competition, visit [3MT® at the University of Queensland](https://threeminutethesis.uq.edu.au/).
