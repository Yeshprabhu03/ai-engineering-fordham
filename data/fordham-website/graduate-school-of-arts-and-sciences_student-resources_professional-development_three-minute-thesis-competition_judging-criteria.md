# Fordham-GSAS Three Minute Thesis Judging Criteria

Presentations will be judged during each round of competition based on the following criteria, which will be weighted equally by a panel of judges (and have an emphasis on audience):

## Comprehension and Content

- Did the presentation provide an understanding of the background to the research question being addressed and its significance?
- Did the presentation clearly describe the key results of the research including conclusions and outcomes?
- Did the presentation follow a clear and logical sequence?
- Were the thesis topic, key results, and research significance and outcomes communicated in language appropriate to a non-specialist audience?
- Did the speaker avoid scientific jargon, explain terminology, and provide adequate background information to illustrate points?
- Did the presenter spend adequate time on each element of the presentation — or did the presenter elaborate for too long on one aspect or was the presentation rushed?

## Engagement and Communication

- Did the oration make the audience want to know more?
- Was the presenter careful not to trivialize or generalize their research?
- Did the presenter convey enthusiasm for their research?
- Did the presenter capture and maintain their audience's attention?
- Did the speaker have sufficient stage presence, eye contact, and vocal range; maintain a steady pace; and have a confident stance?
- Did the PowerPoint slide enhance the presentation? Was it clear, legible, and concise?
