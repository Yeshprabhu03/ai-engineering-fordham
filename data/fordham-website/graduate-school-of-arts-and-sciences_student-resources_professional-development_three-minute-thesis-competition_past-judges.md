# Past Judges

Three Minute Thesis competition participants are carefully observed and assessed by a panel of judges who select winners using rigorous scoring criteria. 3MT® judges represent the best of the Fordham University community. Judges have included Fordham faculty members, students, and alumni who are not only pioneers in a wide range of academic and professional endeavors, but who demonstrate exceptional care for graduate student research and individual development.

Our audience of distinguished alumni, scholars, and faculty members are eligible to vote for the People's Choice Award.
