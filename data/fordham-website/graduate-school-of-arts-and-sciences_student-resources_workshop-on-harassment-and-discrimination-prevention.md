# GSAS Workshop on Harassment and Discrimination Prevention

Fordham University is committed to providing a safe, welcoming and inclusive environment for all members of the university community. As part of this commitment, the Office of Human Resources Management, in collaboration with the
[Title IX Office](/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/title-ix-office/), requires all members of the university community who are receiving compensation for duties to complete an annual workshop on Harassment and Discrimination Prevention. This workshop is pursuant to the “[Stop Sexual Harassment in NYC](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/cchr/law/stop-sexual-harassment-act.page)” Act and the New York State “[Combating Sexual Harassment in the Workplace](https://www.ny.gov/programs/combating-sexual-harassment-workplace)” Law.

Graduate students in the GSAS community whose financial awards require them to fulfill duties (including graduate assistants, teaching assistants, research assistants, teaching fellows, and hourly workers) will be contacted via email with a request that they complete the interactive workshop. The workshop is administered electronically, and takes approximately 60 – 90 minutes to complete.

Students are encouraged to regard the completion of this workshop as much more than a matter of legal compliance. It is worthy of their attention because it promotes equity and inclusion in all aspects of their student experience, and raises awareness and information regarding this important topic.
