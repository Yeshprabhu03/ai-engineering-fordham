# GSE for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)

## Championing Equity, Embracing Diversity, Empowering Communities

Principles of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging are central to [our mission as a Jesuit institution ](/about/living-the-mission/diversity-and-inclusion/)and connect us to a long Catholic tradition of advocating for the dignity and worth of every person.

Fordham University’s Graduate School of Education is committed to preparing educators, school leaders, counselors, and psychologists to promote social change and equity while serving all individuals in inclusive learning and therapeutic environments.

Our graduates are professionals who implement an asset-based perspective that recognizes the cultural wealth that children and clients bring to education and counseling, their individual strengths and needs, and the systemic challenges and opportunities that affect their experiences in schools and the community.

**GSE’s campus community affirms and celebrates the identity of every individual.**

**We are committed to a continuous process of acknowledging and dismantling racism and other forms of oppression and discrimination that cause systemic inequity. We likewise are committed to justice-focused, equity-driven, and culturally-sustaining practices that lead to improved learning opportunities and better social and mental health outcomes for individuals in all communities.**
