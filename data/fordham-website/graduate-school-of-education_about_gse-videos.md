# GSE Videos

The Fordham Graduate School of Education launched a series of TED-like talks featuring dynamic expertise and insights from the GSE. These short powerful talks highlight some of the most pressing educational issues of our time, particularly for underrepresented and underserved students.

We also share a number of other engaging and informative videos on the [GSE YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjTFeKGT_BtKY_Xrxbb1iig) and below, including [an overview from the dean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xabkVnurKys&t=209s) and individual messages from faculty and students in our counseling and psychology, school psychology, curriculum and teaching, and educational leadership programs.
