# GSE Counseling Psychology (Ph.D.) Curriculum

### Counseling Psychology Ph.D. Program Curriculum

Students entering with a bachelor’s degree will need to complete the requirements of the Mental Health Counseling master’s degree en route to the Ph.D., which includes coursework, fieldwork, and the Master’s Comprehensive Exam.
