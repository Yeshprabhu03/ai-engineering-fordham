# GSE Master of Science in Teaching

The Master of Science in Teaching (M.S.T.) programs are designed for those seeking initial teacher certification, whether you have no background in teaching and want to become a teacher or are currently teaching and seeking a master’s degree.

Validating students’ language and culture and respecting the diverse voices of the urban classroom are guiding philosophies of our teacher education programs.

Our programs are distinguished by exceptionally strong field experiences where students feel challenged, engaged, and supported by faculty, supervisors, and mentors.
