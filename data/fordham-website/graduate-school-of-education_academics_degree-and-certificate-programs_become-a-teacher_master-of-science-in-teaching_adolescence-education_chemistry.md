**Please Note: Admissions to the following program are currently on hold for the 2025-2026 application cycle. Program faculty are in the process of redesigning this program and we will update this site to indicate future admission cycles.**

To nurture middle school and high school students’ knowledge and appreciation of the natural sciences, a teacher needs more than a foundation in chemistry.

This program develops teacher candidates’ knowledge and understanding of adolescent learning and development, educational theory, and best practices in science education.
