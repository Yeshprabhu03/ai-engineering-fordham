# Early Childhood Education M.S.T. Programs

Early learning experiences have a significant effect on an individual. For students with special educational needs, the early years are especially critical.

We offer three programs in initial teacher education for persons preparing to be early childhood (birth–grade 2) classroom teachers:

-
[Early Childhood Education](/graduate-school-of-education/academics/degree-and-certificate-programs/become-a-teacher/master-of-science-in-teaching/early-childhood-education-programs/early-childhood-education/) -
[Early Childhood and Childhood Education](/graduate-school-of-education/academics/degree-and-certificate-programs/become-a-teacher/master-of-science-in-teaching/early-childhood-education-programs/early-childhood-and-childhood-education/)(dual certification) -
[Early Childhood and Early Childhood Special Education](/graduate-school-of-education/academics/degree-and-certificate-programs/become-a-teacher/master-of-science-in-teaching/early-childhood-education-programs/early-childhood-special-education/)(dual certification)

The programs provide candidates with the knowledge, skills, and experiences needed for working effectively with all children in the early childhood years (birth-grade 2). The programs have an emphasis on preschool and primary education.

Each program has full-time and part-time options at the Lincoln Center campus.
