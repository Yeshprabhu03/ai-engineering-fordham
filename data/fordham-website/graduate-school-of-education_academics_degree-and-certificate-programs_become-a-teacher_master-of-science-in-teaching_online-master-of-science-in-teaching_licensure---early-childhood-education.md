# Licensure - Early Childhood Education

Fordham University's Early Childhood Education track leads to a Master of Science in Teaching. The designed outcome is to prepare students to apply for an Initial Certificate in Early Childhood Education (birth - grade 2) within New York.

States may recognize different grade ranges for a particular subject area. If students have obtained a New York licensure, students should be aware of any grade range discrepancies between the license they hold and the out of state license they are pursuing. Students should do their own due diligence and determine the appropriate pathway and license type for themselves.

The table below provides a state by state breakdown of comparable licenses, including a determination of eligibility for licensure. This information provided is designed as a baseline determination of whether the program meets individual state specific requirements. Other licenses may be more applicable and/or require additional standards. Licensure requirements and appropriate pathways are subject to change and may differ based on individual student backgrounds, including coursework taken outside the scope of the program.
