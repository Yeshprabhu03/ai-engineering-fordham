# M.S.T. Online Program Tuition, Billing and Financial Aid FAQs

Tuition and Billing

**How much does the online program cost?**

The cost of each course for an Education@Fordham program is determined by the number of registered credit hours. To determine the cost of one course, multiply the current tuition rate by the number of credits required.

For example, for the 2021-2022 year the cost of tuition is $1,500 per credit:

- 3 credits (one course) x $1,500 = $4,500
- 6 credits (two courses) x $1,471 = $9,000

Please keep in mind, tuition per credit does not include per semester fees. For a complete outline of a programs’ tuition and fees visit our [tuition and fees page](/student-financial-services/tuition-and-payments/).*Tuition rate and fees vary by program.*

**Are there additional required fees assessed in addition to tuition? (e.g., fees for technology support, registration, labs, immersions, placements, student life and activities)**

Yes. Fees are determined by program. [For a detailed account of fees visit our tuition and fees page](/student-financial-services/tuition-and-payments/graduate-tuition/graduate-school-of-education/).

**Are students required to accept university health insurance?**

Students who do not complete a waiver prior to the deadline will automatically be enrolled in and charged for each semester in which the student is enrolled. Once the waiver is submitted, the charge will be removed from the student account. Students and authorized payers can verify the adjustment by logging in to [fordham.edu](http://my.fordham.edu/) ("My E-Bill") Students are responsible for verifying that their waiver was submitted correctly. Students will receive an email confirmation after completing the waiver application to confirm that the application is approved or denied.

**How much is the enrollment deposit?**

The non-refundable enrollment deposit is $1,000 and is applied to your first semester’s tuition.

**Can I use financial aid to cover the deposit?**

Federal student aid cannot be used to pay the deposit

**Will I be able to view my award package before submitting the deposit?**

Once you are admitted and complete the financial aid process, any Federal Direct Loan requested will be posted to your account on the [fordham.edu](http://my.fordham.edu/) portal.

**When will I be billed?**

Fall invoices are generated in mid-June through early July. Spring invoices are generated in December. Summer invoices are generated at the beginning of May. Generally, the due date is 2-3 weeks after the invoice is generated and will be reflected on the invoice. For help in understanding your invoice, visit [Understanding Your Bill](/student-financial-services/tuition-and-payments/paying-your-bill/#d.en.185432).

**When is tuition payment due?**

The payment due date will be approximately 2-3 weeks from the date of your invoice (see above). Payments are due prior to the start of classes.

**What are the accepted forms of payment?**

There are various [payment methods offered](/student-financial-services/tuition-and-payments/paying-your-bill/#d.en.185438) that will assist you in paying your tuition and fees. The options include electronic, credit cards (application and deposit fees only), check and money orders, in person, third party billing, wire transfer information (both domestic and international), monthly payment plan, tuition reimbursement, and tuition stabilization plan.

Fordham utilizes electronic billing (E-Bill) to generate invoices. In addition to viewing invoices, a student can authorize a third party (e.g., parent or sponsor) to view the bill. The student is required to provide the email address of the user they wish to authorize.

**How does my employer go about paying the school?**

Students who receive a voucher from their employer to finance their education must present it to the Office of Student Accounts. The voucher must be received by the initial bill due date for the semester. If the voucher is received past the bill due date, you will be responsible for any late fees incurred. The voucher must include the following student information: student name, Fordham Identification Number (FIDN), semester, courses and amount to be paid. The voucher must also include the following employer information: Company name, billing address and contact information. Subsequent to the receipt of your voucher the Student Accounts office will send an invoice to your employer. The employer should remit payment directly to the University. View [Fordham’s Third-Party Billing information](/student-financial-services/tuition-and-payments/paying-your-bill/#d.en.186483).

**Does Fordham offer a payment plan for the online program?**

The University offers a monthly payment plan through Tuition Management Systems (TMS). Students who are receiving financial aid also may participate in this plan. The plan is administered on either an academic year basis with twelve or ten monthly payments, or on a semester basis with five monthly payments. The enrollment fee ranges from $75 - $110. You may also log in to the Fordham website to enroll in a payment plan. You may enroll directly with TMS by calling 1-800-722-4867. You may also log in to the Fordham website to [enroll in a payment plan](/student-financial-services/tuition-and-payments/paying-your-bill/#d.en.186486).

**What are the consequences if my tuition bill is not paid when classes begin?**

You may start classes but need to have the bill completely satisfied before you are able to register for the next term; you will be held responsible for any unpaid tuition. Late fees are assessed monthly until the bill is satisfied.

**What is the process if I’m eligible for a refund?**

A credit balance occurs whenever a student has funds credited to their account which exceeds the total amount of a student's direct charges. Credit balances are refunded directly to the student as soon as possible but no later than 14 days after the first day of classes or the date the funds were applied to a student's account whichever comes last. Regulations stipulate that a student's unpaid charges on their bill must be satisfied before a refund can be processed.

Federal Regulations also require that the University document that a student begin attending classes in order to be eligible for a refund of a credit balance. Therefore, the Office of Student Accounts begins processing refunds once the add/drop period for a college has passed.

If eligible for a [refund](/student-financial-services/tuition-and-payments/paying-your-bill/refunds/), you may receive via direct deposit at no cost; or have your refund sent via check.

Student loans must be requested for each academic year you wish to borrow.

**Can I use loans to cover additional expenses (e.g., housing, books, supplies)?**

Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)

**What is the FAFSA?**

The [Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)](https://studentaid.ed.gov/fafsa) is the application the Department of Education uses to determine if you are eligible to receive federal student aid.

**Where can I find the FAFSA?**

The FAFSA is available online by visiting the [federal student aid website](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa). The FAFSA is a free application; you will not be asked to pay.

**What is the Fordham FAFSA school code?**

The Fordham University FAFSA school code is 002722.

**Do I need my parents’ tax information to complete the FAFSA if I live on my own?**

If you are applying for graduate school, you are considered an independent student, and do not need to include your parents’ information to complete the FAFSA.

**What is the Expected Family Contribution (EFC)?**

The Expected Family Contribution (EFC) is a measurement of your ability to contribute toward your educational costs. As a graduate/professional student your EFC is not a factor in your eligibility for federal student loans.

**When should I complete the FAFSA?**

The FAFSA is available every October 1st for the upcoming academic year. New students planning to use federal student aid should complete a FAFSA while applying for admission. The FAFSA must be completed each academic year in order to remain eligible for federal student aid.

Please reference the table below to determine which FAFSA to complete based on your desired start date:

| Start | Quarter Term | FAFSA Year |
|---|---|---|
| May 2021 | Summer | 2020-2021 |
| August 2021 | Fall | 2021-2022 |
| January 2022 | Spring | 2021-2022 |


The summer term is considered a “trailer” to the academic year. For example, the summer 2021 term is a part of the 2020-21 academic year. You must have a valid 2020-21 FAFSA to receive federal loans in the summer 2021 term. The 2020-21 FAFSA is only available until June 30th, 2021. There are no exceptions as this is a federal guideline.

**What constitutes an academic year for federal student aid?**

An academic year is the year for which financial aid is used to fund your education. Generally, this is the 12-month period that begins on July 1 of one year and ends on June 30 of the following year.

**What federal student aid is available to graduate students?**

The types of federal student aid graduate students are eligible to apply for include the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan and the Federal Direct Graduate PLUS loan. [Learn more about the types of federal student aid](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans).

Keep in mind that to be eligible for any Federal Direct Loan, you must be:

- matriculating in a degree granting program
- enrolled at least half-time as determined by your academic department
- making satisfactory academic progress

**Will I need to fill out the FAFSA each year?**

Yes, you will need to complete the FAFSA for each academic year in which you plan on applying for federal student aid.

**Why am I not eligible for the Pell Grant or Federal Subsidized Loan?**

The Department of Education awards Federal Pell Grants and Subsidized loans to eligible undergraduate students who have not yet completed their bachelor degrees and who demonstrate financial need. The Department of Education does not evaluate need nor income for loans at the Graduate/Professional level. Therefore, graduate students are not eligible for the Federal Pell Grant nor the Direct Subsidized Loan.

Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan

Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan

**What criteria is used to determine eligibility for federal student aid?**

The Direct Unsubsidized Loan is not based on income. In order to apply for federal student aid, you must:

- Be a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen
- Have a valid Social Security Number (SSN)
- Be registered with Selective Service, if you are male (must register between the ages of 18 and 25)
- Be enrolled or accepted for enrollment in an eligible degree program
- Be enrolled at least half-time in an eligible program; if you are involved in degree requirements with a credit equivalency that will raise your enrollment to at least half time (e.g., dissertation or comprehensive examination preparation), you can file an enrollment certification form with your school or department to become eligible. This certification must be processed by Academic Records before your loan proceeds can be disbursed.
- Maintain satisfactory academic progress (SAP); the SAP criteria are defined by each of the graduate schools. You will be notified before the start of the fall term if you are not making SAP and given options on how to appeal your status.
- Not currently be in default on previous student loans borrowed through FSA
- Not have exceeded the maximum aggregate loan limit

You must also provide acceptable documentation to clarify any existing data conflicts from your FAFSA upon request from Fordham. Learn more about [federal student aid eligibility criteria](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/eligibility/basic-criteria) on the Federal Student Aid website.

**What if I am currently in default or have defaulted on a prior federal student loan?**

Visit the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) and contact your lender for details on how to clear the default. Students in default are not eligible for additional federal loans until the default is cleared.

**What is the aggregate loan limit?**

The aggregate loan limit is the total amount that you may borrow in federal student loans for undergraduate and graduate study. In addition to borrowing limitations based on the cost of attendance for the program, students are also limited in terms of lifetime borrowing. The maximum aggregate loan limit for federal loans is $138,500. This amount does not include PLUS loans, nor private loans.

If the total loan amount you receive over the course of your education reaches the aggregate loan limit, you are not eligible to receive additional loans. However, if you repay some of your loans to bring your outstanding loan debt below the aggregate loan limit, you could then borrow again, up to the amount of your remaining eligibility under the aggregate loan limit. You can learn more about [graduate annual loan limits](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized#how-much) on the Federal Student Aid website.

**How do I find out if I am near my aggregate loan limit?**

You may visit the [National Student Loan Data System](https://nslds.ed.gov/nslds/nslds_SA/) website to view your federal student loan borrowing history. Please note that private education loans are not listed on this site.

**What is the difference between a Direct Unsubsidized Loan and a Direct Subsidized loan?**

Direct Subsidized Loans are available to undergraduate students with financial need. The U.S. Department of Education pays the interest on subsidized loans while you are enrolled in their undergraduate program. The Direct Unsubsidized Loan is available to undergraduate and graduate students; there is no requirement to demonstrate financial need. The Unsubsidized loan begins accruing interest as soon as funds are disbursed. [Learn more about the difference between unsubsidized and subsidized loans](https://studentaid.gov/help-center/answers/article/what-is-difference-between-direct-subsidized-loan-and-direct-unsubsidized-loan).

**Do Direct PLUS Loans affect my aggregate loan limit?**

Only Direct Subsidized/Direct Unsubsidized Loans (formerly referred to as Stafford loans) and federal loans made through the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program count toward your aggregate loan limit.

**What are the eligibility criteria to apply for the Direct Graduate PLUS Loan?**

A credit check will be conducted when applying for the Direct Graduate PLUS Loan. In addition to the federal student aid eligibility criteria listed above, applicants cannot have an adverse credit history.

**What are the credit criteria to receive the Direct Graduate PLUS Loan?**

One of the eligibility requirements to receive a Graduate PLUS Loan is that you must not have an adverse credit history. A credit check is performed to determine whether a Graduate PLUS Loan applicant meets this requirement.

Loan Deferment and Repayment

**Do I have to repay my student loans while I’m in school?**

You can defer payment on your federal student loans if you are enrolled at least half-time. You should be aware that although you can defer payments while you are in school, interest will still accrue on your loan(s).

Your Unsubsidized Loan will go into repayment six months after you graduate, fall below half-time status, take a leave of absence or withdraw from the program. Most private loans also have deferred payment options while you are in school; however, you will need to check with your loan servicer.

**When do I have to repay my loan?**

After you graduate, leave school or drop below half-time enrollment, you will have a six-month grace period before you are required to begin repayment. During this period, you'll receive repayment information from your loan servicer, and you will be notified of your first payment due date. Payments are usually due monthly. You are not required to pay while in school, however if you choose to, there is no penalty to prepay. [Learn more about repayment timelines](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment#when-begin).

**What are the repayment plan options and how do I select one?**
