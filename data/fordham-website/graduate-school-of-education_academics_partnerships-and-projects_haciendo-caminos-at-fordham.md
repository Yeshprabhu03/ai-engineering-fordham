# Haciendo Caminos at Fordham

## Forming Hispanic Catholic Leaders Through Faith, Fellowship, and Graduate Study

Fordham University’s Graduate School of Education is proud to be part of Haciendo Caminos, a nationwide initiative that supports the academic, spiritual, and vocational formation of young Hispanic Catholics preparing for ministerial leadership.

As one of 18 Catholic universities in the consortium, Fordham offers graduate fellowships, mentoring, and theological training to students discerning vocations in religious education, ministry, and spirituality. Our goal is to nurture emerging Latino/a leaders—rooted in their cultural identity and community—who are called to serve the Church and the world.

-
**Graduate-level coursework**in theology, ministry, or spirituality -
