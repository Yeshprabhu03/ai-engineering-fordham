The Liberty Partnerships Program is a year round program. LPP students have access to both one-on-one and group tutoring provided by Fordham University’s service learners, community service students and volunteers.

## Academic Support

The Liberty Partnerships Program provides free one-on-one and small group after school tutoring at our local school partner school and at Fordham University's Walsh Library with Fordham University undergraduate service learners and volunteers.

## Counseling

The LPP counseling program is designed to address the social and emotional needs of students and to provide support to both students and families to ensure a well-balanced approach to academic and personal growth. Trained social workers and graduate social work interns work with students and families to assess needs and develop an intervention plan, and then work with and monitor students throughout the year. LPP students take advantage of personal and group counseling, giving them the opportunity to address obstacles that impede their ability to accomplish their goals.

## Extra Curricular Programming

Fordham University's Liberty Partnerships Program strives to expose its students to various college and career readiness opportunities such as college trips, business competitions, speaker panels, and preparatory workshops through our partnerships with Fordham campus departments, college student clubs, and NYC youth organizations. Structured relationships between LPP participants and caring, dedicated Fordham college students are forged through LPP’s volunteer tutoring and mentoring programs. LPP participants also benefit from diverse cultural enrichment experiences such as performing arts productions, sports and wellness activities, social-emotional learning experiences, and family engagement events.
