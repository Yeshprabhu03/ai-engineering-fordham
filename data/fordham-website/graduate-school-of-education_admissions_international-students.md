# GSE International Students

Fordham welcomes international students to our programs in the Graduate School of Education (GSE). We realize that studying in New York City offers many new and exciting opportunities. In addition, it can bring challenges, especially if English is not the students' home language or if the student is unfamiliar with local customs and expectations. To support the success of our students, we offer the following optional services:

- Free diagnostic assessment of English proficiency (comprehension and writing)
- Workshops to improve academic writing (basic and advanced)
- Pronunciation workshops to help students communicate effectively
- Workshops on managing intercultural expectations - both professional and personal

After students are accepted to a GSE program, they meet with their faculty advisors to consider the available support services and select the ones that will best help them succeed academically, professionally, and personally.
