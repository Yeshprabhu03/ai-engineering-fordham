# Financial Aid Checklist

Loans disburse to your account approximately three business days before the start of each term. If you are applying for a loan during the academic year, you should make sure your [Free Application for Federal Student Aid ](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa)(FAFSA) and loan request are submitted at least 2 – 3 weeks before you need funds.

If everything is in place for your loan to disburse before the term start, you will see it as an estimated credit on your bill.

We encourage reviewing our [Financial Aid Guide for Graduate & Professional Students](https://www.fordham.edu/download/downloads/id/10608/2018-19_financial_aid_guide_for_graduate_and_professional_students.pdf) for in-depth information about availability of aid, eligibility requirements, and the application process.

[Complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa)(FAFSA) using Fordham’s school code: 002722.
