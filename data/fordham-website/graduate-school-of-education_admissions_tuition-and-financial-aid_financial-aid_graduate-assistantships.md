# GSE Graduate Assistantships

Graduate assistantship awards are made in recognition of academic achievement, special competencies, and/or academic potential. They provide opportunities for academic and professional development for doctoral students. There are two types of assistantships:

- Research Graduate Assistantships support research, service, or professional efforts. Students must be available during regular business hours; however, they may involve off-site or service activities.
- Administrative Graduate Assistantships support programs administratively. Students must be available during regular business hours.

Students who wish to be considered for a graduate assistantship must have a **valid FAFSA **on file for the academic school year for which they are applying and meet both merit and financial need requirements. Assistantship awards provide tuition remission for one course per semester for students enrolled in a doctoral program. Tuition remission for one course requires 100 hours per semester **(approximately 6.5 hours of assistance per week for 15 weeks).**

**Important Note: Graduate assistantships are not guaranteed as they are based on GSE administrative needs and funding availability.**

## Eligibility

To be eligible for a graduate assistantship, students must:

- demonstrate financial need by completing a FAFSA;
- be enrolled in a minimum of 9 to 12 credits for the fall/spring semesters, and 12 credits for the summer semester in doctoral degree program within the Graduate School of Education; and
- meet the minimum GPA requirements: 3.5 undergraduate GPA and 3.75 graduate GPA.
- Fordham University’s Federal School Code is #002722.

**Important Note: International students may apply for graduate assistantships if the GPA requirement is met.**
