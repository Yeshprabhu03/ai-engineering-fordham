# New York State Mandated Workshops

Are you looking to complete your New York state educator certification mandated workshops? The Hagin Center is currently offering three New York state mandated workshops: Dignity for All Students Act (DASA), Child Abuse Identification and Reporting (CAIR), and Schools Against Violence Education (SAVE). These workshops are held twice each semester, and you do not need to be a Fordham GSE student to attend them.

Individuals must complete these three workshops for educator certification in New York state. Largely, most schools in New York require all employees and interns to have completed these workshops. Many programs at Fordham require students to complete these workshops. Please refer to your faculty advisor for more information about whether you are required to complete them.

These workshops are currently being held remotely via Zoom and Google Classroom. Workshop costs are as follows

- CAIR: $75
- SAVE: $75
- DASA: $92
