# Community Schools Partnership Program

Fordham University's Graduate School of Education, through the Center for Educational Partnerships, is currently the Partner *Community Based Organization* (CBO) for two New York City public schools (Bronx and Manhattan).

We are implementing the * Community Schools* model, designed to provide a comprehensive academic and social-emotional approach for each school community.
