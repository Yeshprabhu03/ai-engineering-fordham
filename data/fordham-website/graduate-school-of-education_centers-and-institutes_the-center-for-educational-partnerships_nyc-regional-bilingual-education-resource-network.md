- On August 16, 2023, the Office of Bilingual Education and World Languages (OBEWL) issued a
[field memo](https://www.nysed.gov/sites/default/files/08-16-23-ell-placement-timeline-extention-memo.pdf)announcing the availability of a waiver to the ELL Identification and Placement timeline for LEAs serving recently arrived asylum seekers. The memo stated that the waiver would be available until further notice. - This announcement serves as notice that
**this flexibility is no longer available**and that all LEAs must again complete the identification of all ELLs by administering the New York State Identification Test for English Language Learners (NYSITELL) and placing eligible students in an appropriate language acquisition program within ten (10) days of a student’s initial enrollment. - LEAs that wish to seek an individual waiver to the ELL Identification and Placement Timeline should send a written request to
[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a3ccc1c6d4cfe3cddad0c6c78dc4ccd5). The request should include data on the number of students anticipated to require identification, the number of qualified staff available to conduct the identification, and the length of time for which the waiver is requested. - Please be advised that all children in New York State, regardless of their immigration or citizenship status, have the right to attend school full-time so long as they meet the age and residency requirements established by state law. Schools must allow these students to begin attending classes as soon as possible, ideally the next school day.
- In addition, please note that recently arrived students in temporary housing are entitled to protections and services under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act. This includes immediate school enrollment, even if the students lack documents normally required for enrollment or have missed application or enrollment deadlines during any period of homelessness.
- Information regarding support for asylum seekers and other recently arrived immigrants can be found on
[the Immigrants and Newcomers webpage](https://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/immigrant-and-newcomer-students)on OBEWL’s website. *For more information, contact OBEWL at*[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cea1acabb9a28ea0b7bdabaae0a9a1b8)*or 518-747-8775.*
