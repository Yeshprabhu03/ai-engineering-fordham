# NYS Community Schools Technical Assistance Center (TAC)

The New York State Community Schools Technical Assistance Centers (TAC) for New York City and the Eastern Region provide a wide range of professional development (PD) and technical assistance (TA) to all existing Community School Programs and aspiring schools.

The mission of the CS-TACs is to deliver quality guidance and training to the Community Schools in New York City and the Eastern Region.
