# CEP Stop School Violence Project

Fordham University's Center for Educational Partnerships (CEP), supported by a grant from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), is excited to introduce the “STOP School Violence” program. This distinctive program operates within selected public middle and high schools throughout the Bronx and Manhattan. The initiative adopts a comprehensive strategy to curb school violence by focusing on mental health and engaging essential community stakeholders, including students, school staff, school safety agents, mental health professionals and families.

This three-year program offers specialized workshops and training focusing on trauma informed strategies. This program creates secure and supportive educational environments by promoting practices such as trauma-informed care, restorative justice, and positive school culture enhancement at no cost to participating schools.
