# The Center for Educational Partnerships Coaching Programs

*Not every teacher has the opportunity to go to Fordham, but all teachers can have Fordham come to them.*

Fordham University’s Mathematics, Literacy, and ELL Coaching Program draw from over 100 years of experience in education, using scientifically based and time-tested methodologies to provide a wide spectrum of coaching and support services.

Our expert coaches use the practice/reflection model of coaching support, providing multiple opportunities for teachers to engage in a dynamic dialogue. Structured in three phases (pre-planning, observation, and debriefing/feedback), learning opportunities are maximized by developing critical reflection, which leads to growth in content knowledge and skills. Our work draws deeply from the Next Generation Learning Standards and successful professional evaluation models.

The main goal of our program is simple: make high-quality and affordable professional development accessible to teachers by bringing it directly to their classrooms. A Fordham coach can see up to five teachers per visit (approximately one hour per teacher). A coach will model, demonstrate, and team-teach. The focus is on best practices in support of a school’s current curriculum/program.

We strive to customize activities in schools and thus tailor programs to meet the needs of each school and staff.
