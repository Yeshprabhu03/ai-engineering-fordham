# CEP Mathematics Coaching Program

Our work is guided by the **Next Generation Learning Standards** for *Mathematical Practice* and focuses on types of expertise that mathematics educators should develop. Our coaches model, demonstrate and team teach, incorporating:

- Differentiated Instruction Techniques
- Higher Order Questioning Skills
- Math Vocabulary
- Interactive Instruction
- Student Engagement

With the **Next Generation Learning Standards** (pre-K-12) as the benchmark, coaches across the grade levels will address "big ideas" of mathematics, including:

- Number Sense and Operations
- Geometry
- Measurement
- Statistics and Probability
- Algebra
