Akane Zusho, Ph.D. is Professor and Chair of the Division of Educational Leadership, Administration, and Policy in Fordham’s Graduate School of Education, and the faculty director of the Bronx Research Institute for Community Solutions, housed in Fordham’s Center for Community Engaged Learning.

She is the driving force behind the Liberatory Motivation Framework, a groundbreaking approach that centers equity, purpose, and joy in how leaders and the communities they serve stay engaged and empowered. For more than two decades, her scholarship has guided educators and leaders in creating schools where all students can thrive. Building on this foundation, she now extends that impact across sectors by advancing workforce development initiatives focused on opportunity and liberation in underserved communities.

Dr. Zusho is a dedicated mentor who collaborates with graduate students and community partners to turn research into real-world impact. She was honored with the APA’s Richard E. Snow Early Contributions Award and is Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Experimental Education, while also serving on the editorial boards of Educational Psychologist, Contemporary Educational Psychology, Theory into Practice, and Educational Psychology for Policy and Practice.
