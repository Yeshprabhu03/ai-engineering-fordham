Courteney Johnson is an assistant professor in the Fordham Graduate School of Education's Division of Psychological and Educational Services. Johnson’s dissertation explored "*Increasing the Effectiveness of a Social Emotional Learning Curriculum for African American Students with Internalizing Symptoms through Cultural Adaptation". *She says the experiences creating her disssertation undoubtedly shaped her interest in researching the ways in which schools, and clinicians, can better address the social-emotional needs of diverse populations, for instance, the cultural adaptation of a social emotional curriculum for Black teens.

Johnson’s research interests focus on modifying evidence-based practices and interventions for specific projects. She is currently working on two projects, one on adapting a social emotional learning curriculum for Black youth, the other, looking at ways to support the implementation of Positive Behavioral Intervention and Supports (PBIS) in classrooms with children on the spectrum, by integrating identified evidence-based practices.

Johnson is also a certified school psychologist and licensed psychologist in New York State. She has worked in both clinical and administrative roles within NYC schools. She completed an APPIC/APA accredited internship at the Louisiana State University Student Health Center as part of their School Psychology Consortium. Johnson received her Ph.D. in School Psychology from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst.
