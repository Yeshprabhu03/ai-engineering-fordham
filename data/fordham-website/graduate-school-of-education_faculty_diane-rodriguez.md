Diane Rodriguez is a professor in the Division of Curriculum and Teaching. Her primary research interest is at the intersection of special education, bilingual and multicultural education, and teacher preparation.

Rodriguez has received numerous grants from the U.S. Office of Special Education and Rehabilitation Services and the Office of English Language Acquisition. She has been an invited speaker at national and international conferences on special education and bilingual education.

Rodriguez continues her work to provide training in special education to international audiences. She currently serves as an executive board member for both the East Coast Migrant Head Start Project and the Council for Exceptional Children's Division of Learning Disabilities.

Previously, Rodriguez served as a member of the Council for Exceptional Children's Nomination Committee, and was a co-editor of the *Journal of Curriculum and Instruction*. She was also appointed to the North Carolina Advisory Council on Latino Affairs by former Governor George Ervin "Sonny" Perdue III. Finally, Univision selected Rodriguez as an example of "Orgullo de Nuestra Comunidad," [pride of our community] which highlights individuals who give back to the community. Specifically, she was recognized for her work with individuals with disabilities in a Univision-created on-air vignette which has run on national television.
