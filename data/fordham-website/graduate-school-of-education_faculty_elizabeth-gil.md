Elizabeth Gil joined the faculty of the Educational Leadership, Administration, and Policy (ELAP) Division of the Fordham Graduate School of Education (GSE) in 2020. Prior to joining the GSE, she was an assistant professor in the Department of Administrative and Instructional Leadership at St. John’s University. Gil holds a Ph.D. in K–12 Educational Administration from Michigan State University, where she was named a King-Chávez-Parks Future Faculty Fellow. A native New Yorker, she taught in New York City Public Schools for more than 10 years, where she worked with students, teachers, administrators, and families as a teacher, professional developer, mentor, and data specialist. Gil has also served as residential faculty and curriculum co-coordinator in the Institute for Recruitment of Teachers Summer Workshop, which helps prepare college students for the graduate school application process.

She has published articles and book chapters investigating leadership in community spaces, and how educational leaders can learn from effective practices in these spaces. Gil's work has examined environments that foster parental and youth empowerment, and culturally responsive leadership. She has also written about immigrant parents' experiences with school choice, as well as explored the role of co-constructed peer mentoring for early-career faculty. Her work has been published in *Journal of School Leadership*, *International Journal of Leadership in Education*, and *International Journal of Mentoring and Coaching in Education*. Gil's latest book chapter was published in *Latinas Leading Schools*, which was released in early 2021.
