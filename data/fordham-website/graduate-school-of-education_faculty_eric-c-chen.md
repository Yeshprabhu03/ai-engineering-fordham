Eric C. Chen, Ph.D., was born and raised in Taiwan. Before moving to the U.S. to pursue his graduate studies, he taught Chinese at a high school in Taipei. He earned his Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology from Arizona State University and joined Fordham University in 1995. During his tenure at Fordham, Dr. Chen has held several leadership positions, including serving as Chair of the PES Division (2003-2006), Vice Chair (2019-2020), Interim Chair (2020), and Training Director of the PhD Counseling Psychology program (2010-2012). From 2020 to 2025, he also coordinated the master’s mental health counseling program.

Dr. Chen has contributed extensively to the academic community, serving on the editorial boards of multiple journals, including the *Journal of Counseling Psychology* and *Group Dynamics: Theory, Research, and Practice,* where he previously served as an Associate Editor. He served on the Board of the Society of Group Psychology and Group Psychotherapy (Division 49 of the APA) and currently serves on the Board of the Masters in Psychology and Counseling Accreditation Council (MPCAC), which accredits master’s programs that meet counseling profession standards.

In recognition of the impact of his work, Dr. Chen was awarded APA Fellow status in 2016. He also received the Presidential Award from APA Division 49 at the APA’s 2020 annual meeting. Since 2021, Dr. Chen has directed the [Clinical Mental Health Services (CCMH)](https://sites.google.com/fordham.edu/ccmh/ccmh-mission?authuser=0) program, funded by the Mother Cabrini Health Foundation, which offers free telehealth services to underserved children and youth in the Bronx. With this latest funding from the Mother Cabrini Health Foundation Dr. Chen has secured a total of $1,720,000 to support the CCMH program. The expansion will include an internship training program for two mental health counseling students, launching in the 2025–2026 academic year, and the hiring of additional clinical graduate assistants in spring 2025.

In early 2023, Dr. Chen secured a grant of nearly $3.5 million from the U.S. Department of Education to direct the project * Educate School-Based Mental Health Professionals for Justice: A Developmental-Contextual Approach* from 2023 to 2027.
