She worked as a licensed mental health counselor in an outpatient clinic in New York City prior to returning to graduate school to complete her Ph.D. in Counseling Psychology at the University at Albany, SUNY. She has provided mental health treatment to children and adults across a variety of settings including, jails, outpatient clinics, and hospitals.
