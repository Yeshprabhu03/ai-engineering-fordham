Marilyn Bisberg is a clinical instructor, advisor and professor for Early Childhood/Early Childhood Special Education programs in the Graduate School of Education at Fordham University.

Prior to joining the GSE faculty, Bisberg worked in the field for 23 years as a special educator, providing services and instruction to children with IEP's and their families, from birth to age five. During that time, she became a specialist in understanding the management of behavior, its role in learning and in social and emotional learning. Bisberg utilized various funding sources to serve children in myriad ways, including through early intervention home and family based intervention, Special Education Itinerant Teaching (SEIT), and self-contained preschool classrooms. Throughout her tenure, she demonstrated a particular commitment to working with the underserved, both as a special educator and child/family advocate.

Since joining the GSE faculty in 2006, Bisberg has focused her attention on teacher preparation, both pedagogically and practically. In the GSE's New to Early Childhood programs, she concentrates on the following areas: infants and toddlers and early intervention; managing and preventing behaviors; use of video in student teaching; social and emotional teaching and learning; teaching diverse groups of children; and developing teachers as leaders.
