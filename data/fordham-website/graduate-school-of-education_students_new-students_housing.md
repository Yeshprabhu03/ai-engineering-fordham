The University has allocated a number of unfurnished studio and one-bedroom apartments in a building just a few blocks from the University at 134 West 58th Street.

The majority of the building residents are members of the Fordham community (graduate students, faculty, and staff). There is on-site laundry and a concierge desk in the lobby.

The fee for the apartment is billed at the beginning of each semester. Residents are responsible for setting up and paying for electricity, cable, internet, and phone.

There are no Fordham-sponsored accommodations for spouses or families.

## Non-Fordham Off-Campus Resources
