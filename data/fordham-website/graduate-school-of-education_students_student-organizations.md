## Counseling Psychology Action Committee

The Counseling Psychology Action Committee (CPAC) is a student-run organization for the Counseling Psychology doctoral students that serves many functions, including as a liaison between students and faculty, hosting social events, and organizing externship/internship support. CPAC is designed to serve the students by creating a community that begins with our mentorship program that pairs first year doctoral students with more advanced students in the program. The leaders of CPAC also help to distribute important information and opportunities to current students. If you have any questions or would like to be involved, please contact us at:
