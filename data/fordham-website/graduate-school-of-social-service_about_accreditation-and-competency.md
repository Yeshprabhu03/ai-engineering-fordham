# GSS Accreditation and Competency

The Fordham Graduate School of Social Service (GSS) B.S.W., M.S.W. and Ph.D. in Social Work programs are accredited by the Council on Social Work Education. Students are assessed on their mastery of the competencies that comprise the Council’s accreditation standards. These competencies are dimensions of practice that all social workers are expected to master during their professional training. An assessment score at or above that benchmark set by the social work program represents mastery of that particular competency. We report all data from our social work accreditation assessments to the Council and use it to continuously review and improve our program and learning environment.
