## A Quick Look: Fordham's Westchester Campus

Fordham's Westchester campus boasts large, sunlit classrooms equipped with smart technology that set the stage for an intimate learning experience for those who prefer a small-campus environment over the big city. Conveniently located right off I-287, I-684, and the Hutchinson River Parkway, get the same Fordham education without the commute into NYC.

We offer B.S.W. and M.S.W. programs at Fordham University's Westchester campus. You can complete all your degree requirements on this campus.

Located in the beautiful suburb of West Harrison, our Westchester Campus is housed in a three-story, state-of-the-art building on 32 landscaped acres. Fordham Westchester offers residents of Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, and Fairfield counties class schedules designed for people with busy lives.

At Westchester, small class sizes and the opportunity to interact with professors and fellow students are central components of academic life.
