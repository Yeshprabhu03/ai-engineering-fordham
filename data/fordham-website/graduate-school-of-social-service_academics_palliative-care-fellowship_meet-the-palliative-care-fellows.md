# Meet the Palliative Care Fellows

Our Palliative Care program graduates are immensely grateful for the opportunity to pursue a career with such meaning. Chosen from many applicants, the Fellows possess the motivation, determination, and skills to become highly competent palliative social workers.

Each year, the Fellows write a statement about why they want to pursue a career in palliative care social work, and what their experience has been in the program. Please use the buttons below to read the Meet the Fellows statements from the designated year.
