# Meet the GSS Admissions Team

Choosing the right MSW program is a big decision, and we’re here to support you every step of the way. At Fordham’s Graduate School of Social Service, our admissions team isn’t just here to answer your questions—we’re social workers ourselves. Most of us have earned our MSWs, so we understand both the challenges and the rewards of this journey.

Our dedicated team is known for our personal approach and fast response times. Whether you have questions about the application process, financial aid, or how our program fits your career goals, we’re ready to help.

Want to talk one-on-one? Schedule a virtual meeting with one of our team members below. We’d love to connect.
