# Federal Graduate PLUS Loan Changes and the GSS MSW Summer Jumpstart

**Start your Fordham MSW coursework early and save ****big**

Accepted for the fall 2026 Fordham MSW cohort as an on-campus student? You can actually begin your coursework in summer 2026 through our new **Summer Jumpstart Option**, which gets you closer to graduation and secures your financial aid options. Watch the above video to learn more about this process.

**Why this is important: **Beginning **July 1, 2026**, Federal **Graduate PLUS loans will no longer be available to new borrowers** nationwide. But if you enroll and start classes before that date, you’ll remain eligible for Grad PLUS loans for the entirety of your degree.

**Bottom line:** On-campus MSW students (Lincoln Center, Westchester, Molloy) who enroll in six (6) credits before July 1, 2026, are eligible for Grad PLUS loans. Those who start after will not be eligible.

**Want to start in summer 2026? **[Submit your application](https://gradadmissions.fordham.edu/portal/apply_gss) **as early as possible, as Summer Jumpstart seats are limited**.
