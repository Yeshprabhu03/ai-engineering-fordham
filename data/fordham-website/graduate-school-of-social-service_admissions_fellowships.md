### Palliative Care Fellowship

Palliative Care Fellows are carefully screened in order to choose students who are both clinically and academically strong, have personal characteristics that make them good candidates for working with seriously ill individuals and families in a fast-paced environment and on an interdisciplinary team, and who are committed to a career working with seriously individuals and their families. Fellows receive a tuition stipend, support and mentoring, a dedicated Field Seminar led by an experienced palliative social worker, and an internship working with seriously ill individuals and their family members in inpatient, outpatient, community-based and hospice care settings.
