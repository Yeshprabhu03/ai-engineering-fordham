The Fordham Institute for Women and Girls, established in 2001, works to promote gender equality by addressing all forms of discrimination against women and girls locally and globally.

Institute members engage in interdisciplinary education, research and practice activities that work to foster gender equality and:

- Expand our understanding of the problems facing girls and women, such as poverty, ageism, sexism and racism.
- Contribute to critical analyses of the position of girls and women worldwide.
- Improve programs and the delivery of services for girls, women and their children.
- Help prevent inequity and injustice towards women and girls by influencing public and university policy.
- Promote the integration of content on women and girls into social work curricula.
