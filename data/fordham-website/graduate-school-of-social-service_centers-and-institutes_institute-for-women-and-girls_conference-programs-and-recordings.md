**Closing the Digital Divide**

When was the last time you left home without your phone? In our world access to digital technology is critical to everyday activities like work, school, health care, and socializing. However, despite the importance of technology many across the globe have little or no access creating a digital divide. Today Closing the Digital Divide is of increasing importance especially for those of us in the social work and health professions. For this conference the Fordham Institute of Women and Girls (FIWG) and the International Health Awareness Network (IHAN) selected global speakers from business, health, schools, libraries, IT, and social work to address this issue and offer some solutions.

**Why the U.N. Matters**

"Thirty years ago, the United Nations held the “Convention of the Rights of the Child.” The event produced an international agreement on the rights and protection of children, which has become regarded as “the most widely ratified human rights treaty in history” and helped inspire governments to implement laws and policies to protect children and invest in their care, according to UNICEF.

A look at that convention as well as three other U.N.-related anniversaries—the first for the Global Compacts on Migration and Refugees, the 20th for the passage of the Security Council Resolution 1325, which addressed the specific impacts of armed conflict on women and girls and the 23rd of the Fourth World Conference on Women: Action for Equality, Development and Peace held in Beijing, were the major themes at a conference."
