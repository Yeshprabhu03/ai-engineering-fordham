# Institute for Women and Girls Student Group

Students are invited to join our Student Group to raise awareness of women and social justice issues. The Group plans events or activities that are relevant to or intended to benefit, women and girls. It fosters leadership skills and is also a forum for students to hear about faculty and seasoned social workers' professional histories and career paths. Both women and men are welcome to join.
