Dr. Alonzo received her PhD from Fordham University’s Graduate School of Social Service where she was awarded a National Institute of Mental Heath Research Training Fellowship. As a Co-Investigator at the Developing Centers for Interventions for the Prevention of Suicide (DCIPS) at New York State Psychiatric Institute, she conducted studies examining risk and protective factors across cultures related to mood disorders and suicidal behavior. With funding from the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP), the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD), the Mental Health Association of New York State (MHANYS), and the Office of Mental Health of New York State (OMHNYS), her research has focused on the development of novel interventions aimed at improving treatment engagement and adherence among suicide attempters.
