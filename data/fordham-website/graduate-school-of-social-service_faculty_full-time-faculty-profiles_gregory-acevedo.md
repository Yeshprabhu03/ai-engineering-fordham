**Dr. Greg Acevedo is an Associate Professor and BASW Program Director. Much of Dr. Acevedo’s scholarly work has focused on the political, economic, and socio-cultural well-being of Puerto Ricans and those who are categorized within the Hispanic/Latino/Latina/Latinx rubrics or self-identify as being a member of any of these categories. Dr. Acevedo’s work underscores how macro level issues and social problems, such as globalization, human migration, poverty, and inequality, manifest themselves at the level of community, particularly communities that have experienced long-standing marginalization. Dr. Acevedo’s scholarly interests include a focus on the settlement house movement in London and New York City and how current settlement house practices have developed within their national and local contexts. Dr. Acevedo’s scholarly interests also center on community-engaged teaching and learning and community-based research in the Bronx, NY. Currently, Dr. Acevedo is participating in a two-year, grant-funded Participatory Action Research project that investigates whether young Londoners receive the emotional support they need from their families in the context of the current cost-of-living crisis. The study seeks to better understand the relationships between young Londoners and their families and their consequences for young people’s health and development. The project is a collaboration among partners from the voluntary sector, academia, and London’s political, health and social care system. Before beginning his academic career, Dr. Acevedo trained in family therapy at the Philadelphia Child Guidance Clinic and practiced as a certified family therapist in various children and family settings and mental health agencies.** -
