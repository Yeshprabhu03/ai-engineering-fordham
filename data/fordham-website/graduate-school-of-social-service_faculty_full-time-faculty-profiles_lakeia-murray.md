Dr. Murray began her career in social work in 2009 and has over 15 years of experience in the social service field. She has worked in a variety of roles, including case management, medical and psychiatric social work, behavioral health, substance abuse counseling, psychotherapy, ABA therapy, youth counseling services, education, as well as in supervisory, management, and leadership positions.

Prior to joining Fordham University, Dr. Murray served as a Mental Health Manager at a nonprofit agency, where she oversaw several mental health programs and supervised interns. Throughout her career in social services, she identified significant gaps within the child welfare and educational systems. These disparities motivated her to advance her career in social work, with a focus on educating future social workers and raising awareness about human trafficking and the traumas faced by vulnerable populations.

As an educator, Dr. Murray is passionate about enhancing students' understanding of social work practice, the traumas and disparities affecting oppressed communities, and helping students connect their fieldwork experiences to the theories and knowledge they acquire in the classroom.
