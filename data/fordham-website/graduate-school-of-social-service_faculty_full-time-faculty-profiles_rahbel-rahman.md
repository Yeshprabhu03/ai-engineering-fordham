**Rahman studies organizational and provider-level factors that influence the Community Health Worker (CHW) workforce on multiple levels across Pakistan, Brazil, and United States (New York). Over time, she has expanded her focus to include providers who share similar lived experiences as the clients they serve, namely Peer Educators and Peer Workers in addition to CHWs; thus, informing the umbrella term that she uses in her research:***community-based providers*. She has developed a keen interest in the examination of structural, contextual, and provider-level factors that impact the provision of integrated services (mental health, maternal health, sexual health, interpersonal violence, substance abuse, and disease prevention) by the*community-based provider*workforce. More recently, Rahman has become interested in studying predictors to maternal mental health among the Pakistani community and how the COVID-19 pandemic has sparked added racism and stigma in the lives of both community-based providers and the clients they serve. Across each of her research areas, she intentionally uses CBPR approaches because these approaches resonate with her commitment to advancing health equity and health care delivery systems – specifically by shifting ownership of the research process to those impacted. -
