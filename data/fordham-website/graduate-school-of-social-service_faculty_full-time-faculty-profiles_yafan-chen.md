Yafan Chen is an Assistant Professor at the Graduate School of Social Service at Fordham University. Her research focuses on interpersonal violence against women and children, with a concentration on (1) the longitudinal effects of child abuse and neglect and exposure to intimate partner violence on children, and (2) interpersonal violence in minoritized communities, particularly Asian and Latine communities. As a quantitative researcher, she uses advanced statistical methods to analyze both primary data and secondary national datasets. Her teaching philosophy is grounded in a student-centered perspective, which guides her to empower students with empathy, compassion, and respect, and meet students where they are. As an educator, she is dedicated to fostering the next generation of social workers who aim to empower marginalized and vulnerable populations.
