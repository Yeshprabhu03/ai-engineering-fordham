# GSS Field Education

Field Education is the signature pedagogy of an MSW degree program. MSW internships offer students the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge and skills gained in course studies to direct work with clients in real-life situations under the supervision of an experienced social worker. Students gain direct practice experience with individuals and families, organizations, communities, and social/political systems at their field practicums.

**After completing the Generalist field practicum, students move on to the Specialist/Advanced field practicum. In this field, students learn and apply the skills of advanced levels of practice with more complex client systems and/or concentrated practice modalities. Students can have an opportunity to engage in advanced clinical practice or macro/administrative practice. In the assignment of Specialist field placements, students work collaboratively with Field Education staff and have input into the choice of field placement selection.** -
**As part of the Field Work experience, students participate in Field Advisement Sessions. These sessions provide a supportive resource to help students understand and conceptualize their social work practice within a peer-learning environment. Field Advisement Sessions give students an opportunity through discussion discussions and other learning tools to help students translate learning from their classes to develop the skills needed in social work practice. Students are required to attend seven Field Advisement sessions once a month during each of the field practicums. Field Seminar sessions meet for two hours, for a total of 14 hours over the course of the academic year.** -
**A field advisor who supports students by liaising between the School and the field agency facilitates the Field Advisement Session. The advisor ensures that students have quality learning experiences in the field. The field advisor and the supervising field instructor support the student in developing cohesive working relationships for student learning.** -
