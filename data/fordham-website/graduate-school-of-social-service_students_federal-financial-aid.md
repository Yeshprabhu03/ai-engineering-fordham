## Federal Loan Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy (SAP)

Each School of Fordham University has established minimum standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) that students must maintain as they pursue their degree or certificate. The University measures SAP annually at the end of the spring semester.

To be eligible for federal aid, such as Federal Direct Subsidized, and Unsubsidized Loans or Graduate PLUS Loans, each student must be making SAP according to the School's standards. The requirements to be eligible for federal financial aid for the Fordham Graduate School of Social Service:

- Minimum 3.0 GPA required for MSW, 3.50 for Ph.D. degree

- Must be registered for a minimum of six credits

- Must successfully complete six credits each term

- Complete the course of study for a M.S.W. degree within 5 years, Ph.D. degree within 8 years

- Incompletes, withdrawals, and noncredit remedial courses will count against attempted but not earned hours

- Transfer credits that count toward the student's current program will count as both attempted and completed hours

- No credit check for Leave of Absence students and Maintenance of Matriculation students

*The Matriculated Student Status Certification form must be completed by a student who may be registered for fewer credits to qualify for ½, ¾, or full-time certification for purposes of Veteran’s Benefits and federal financial aid eligibility.

The Fordham University Graduate School of Social Service does permit appeals, when a student loses FSA eligibility because he/she failed to make satisfactory progress.
