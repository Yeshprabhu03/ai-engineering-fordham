# Setting Your College Priorities

As you start the college application process, you might be thinking: High school students shouldn’t be expected to have their whole lives—their college choices, their careers, and their futures—all planned out. We agree! College is a time and a place for discovery.

But when you’re looking for the right college, there are three big questions we encourage you to ask yourself:

## What are you interested in studying?

The biggest academic question you need to keep in mind is: “Is [this school] a good academic match for my level of achievement and my interests?” Patricia Peek, Ph.D., dean of undergraduate admission at Fordham, says.

For example, if you’re interested in business and science and technology, having only business schools on your list limits your options. If you’re a creative person, having only specialized technical schools on your list might not allow you to pursue all the subjects you’re passionate about.

Do you like conducting experiments and working in a lab? Are you someone who likes to tell stories? Do you enjoy solving problems and mathematical equations?

If you answered yes to more than one of those questions—or if you’re unsure of what you want to study—schools with large liberal arts and sciences programs and a variety of majors might allow you to explore your options more than a school that offers only highly specialized programs. At Fordham, for example, more than 20% of each incoming class is undecided about what they want to study—and that’s OK!

## What are you interested in outside of the classroom?

Your extracurricular activities can also help you decide what kind of school you want to attend. If you’re involved in student government, schools with political science and leadership programs could be a good choice for you. If you like volunteering in your community, think about schools that make service and community-engaged learning part of the curriculum. If drama, singing, and theater are your passion, schools with strong performing arts programs could be right for you. If you love playing basketball or soccer, think about schools that offer a variety of levels of sports, from Divison I level for highly competitive athletes to intramurals for those who just want to play with their friends.

## What kind of environment do you want to live in and be a part of?

Overall, think about schools that you could picture yourself attending. Do you like small classes where you get to know your professors and work closely with them, or are large lecture halls filled with students more for you? Do you like being in the middle of a big city, or do you like a quieter, smaller town? Do you like attending football or basketball games with your friends? Do you like visiting museums and attending plays, concerts, and other live performances? Do you want to be close to your family, or are you looking to live somewhere new?

Every type of school—large or small, urban or suburban or rural—has its advantages and disadvantages, but what matters most is where you feel most at home. The better you can get to know yourself and what makes you happier, the better college match you’ll find.

Keeping these questions in mind when you start to look at schools can help you narrow down the options that might be right for you, and help you picture what your next four years could be like.
