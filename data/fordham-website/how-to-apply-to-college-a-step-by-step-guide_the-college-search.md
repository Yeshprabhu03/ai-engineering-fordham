# The College Search

**Congratulations! You’re ready to start looking at colleges. If you haven’t already, we recommend asking yourself a few questions that can help you set your college priorities. **

## Make a List and Check it Twice

Once you’ve set your college priorities, you’re ready to make a list of schools that meet your criteria. These schools would have majors and programs of study you’re interested in; offer a variety of opportunities such as research and internships; and be located in places you want to live and study.

Of course, cost is a consideration when choosing a school, but don’t disqualify yourself from the financial aid process. Colleges often have a variety of scholarships and grants available to help you bring down the cost of attendance and make it more affordable.

## Visit if You Can

**Once you've made your list, we recommend setting aside time to visit each school—in person, if possible. But do explore a school’s virtual options to get an initial idea of the campus and what it can offer you.**

## Connect

**Colleges love to talk to prospective students. You can connect with counselors at each school to get some more information that might help you decide if the college is right for you. **
