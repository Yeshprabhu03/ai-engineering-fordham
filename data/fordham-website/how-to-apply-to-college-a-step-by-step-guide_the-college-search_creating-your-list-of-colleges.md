# Creating Your List of Colleges

Once you have a picture of what you might want your college experience to be like, make a list of schools that seem like a good match for your vision.

Your list should include a variety of schools, from those with specific academic requirements that you aren’t sure if you meet 100% to those with requirements that you definitely meet or exceed.

Insider Tip: As you create your college list, write down the application deadlines you would need to meet for each school.

## Which schools should you put on your list?

- Those that offer majors, minors, and programs of study that interest you.
- Those that are located in a city, town, or state where you might want to live and study.
- Those that are in an environment—urban, suburban, or rural—where you feel you can thrive.
- Those that offer a rich network of opportunities—such as internship and research programs—that can help you find your path to a fulfilling career and life once you graduate.

## What schools are best for *you*?

One of Dean Peek’s biggest pieces of advice for students is: “You should never have a school on your list that you would never intend to go to.”

You might feel tempted to consider applying to schools where your friends are going, or you might feel pressured to apply to schools your family members attended or would like to see you attend. But ask yourself what you want in a school. You need to find the right school for you, not what works best for someone else—no matter how much you love or admire that person.

## What if the schools I love are expensive?

Don’t rule out schools immediately just because of potential cost. While financial considerations should be a part of your decision-making process, keep in mind that many schools offer scholarships, grants, and loans to help cover the cost of admission.

Brian Ghanoo, associate vice president for student financial services at Fordham, tells students and families to go through the entire financial aid process and not “self-eliminate” from it.
