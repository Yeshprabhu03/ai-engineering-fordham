Once you’ve created a list of schools you’re interested in, the next step is to set up campus visits. Before you do, consider what you can learn online. Virtual tours and other live and recorded events can help you see schools that might be difficult or cost-prohibitive for you to visit in person. These sessions can also give you an opportunity to ask questions about the things that are most important to you.

Still, nothing beats visiting a school in person. If it’s possible for you to do that, you will get a real look and feel of the campus and student life. You’ll have an opportunity to meet and talk with students and faculty in person and see what the community is like and if it's right for you. Your impressions can help you determine if you’ll thrive there.

Here are some questions to keep in mind when you’re visiting a college or university:

**How many students live on and off campus?**This question can help you gain a sense of what your experience might be like. If a lot of students commute to school, the campus might be full of activities during the day but quieter at night. If many students live on campus, activities and events could take place more frequently, including at night or on weekends. Many schools have a mix of both.**What’s the neighborhood like near campus?**If you’re more energized by quiet, natural environments than bustling urban ones, a school in the heart of a big city might not be right for you. If you’re more energized by places with a lot of people, a high level of activity, and a variety of venues to explore, a small college town might not have everything you’re looking for.**What kind of clubs and activities are popular on campus?**Knowing what activities take place on campus can help you imagine how you might meet new friends and spend your time outside of the classroom.**Are there campus traditions students take part in?**Learning if there are events—such as homecoming, concerts, or movie nights—that bring the student body together on a regular basis can help you gain a feel for school spirit and campus culture.**What are the demographics of the student body?**A diverse student body can make for a richer educational experience for you and your classmates. What do you know about the gender and religious affiliation or the ethnic and racial background of students who attend the school? Are most students from the same geographic location? How many of them are the first in their family to go to college? These are just some of the questions that can help you get a sense of a school community.
