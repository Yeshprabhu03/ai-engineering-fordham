When you’re thinking about which school you want to choose, keep academic programs at the top of your mind. Even if you haven’t decided exactly what you want to study, think about your interests and make sure they’re available to you.

Do you like exploring the environment? Does pursuing a career in health care sound like you? Prioritize the schools that offer a rich variety of science majors.

Do you want to understand the latest business trends and financial markets? Does forming your own company sound interesting? Think about schools with strong business programs that feature a variety of majors, partnerships, and opportunities for internships.

Do you like exploring historical events and learning how people have shaped the modern world? Make sure the school you choose has a rich history program, and even complementary options, such as women’s studies and African American studies.

Does learning the ins and out of how to make a difference in journalism, communications, or digital media interest you? Think about which of the schools you’ve been admitted to have hands-on classes and opportunities to put your skills into practice.

And if you don’t know what you want to study, think about choosing a school that offers a wide range of majors and an in-depth core curriculum that will allow you to explore your options. At Fordham, for example, we offer more than 70 majors and minors across three colleges. And students have the opportunity to try a variety of courses before they declare a major.

Some questions to keep in mind:

**What kind of classroom environment do you work best in?**Do you function better in small classes, with personal interactions with your professors? Or do you prefer larger, lecture-style classes?**What specific resources do you want to have available to you?**Do the schools on your list have academic advisers to help you select your major? Is there a career services department to help you, even after you graduate?**What kinds of internships and research programs are available?**For many students, successful careers after college start while they’re still students. Undergraduate research programs can give you a leg up when applying to advanced degree programs. And internships can help you connect with potential employers and allow you to gain career experience.**What types of partnerships and graduate programs are available?**Does the school offer any five-year programs that will allow you to enhance your undergraduate studies and earn an advanced degree? If you know you want to go to graduate school, enrolling in a dual-degree program while you’re an undergraduate can help save you money.**What do a school’s graduates do with their college education?**Have alumni of the schools you’re looking at had success finding jobs and getting into graduate school programs? Thinking about where recent graduates have had success can help you picture how your college education can help you achieve your goals.
