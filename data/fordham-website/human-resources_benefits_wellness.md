## The Importance of Employee Wellness: A Fordham University Commitment

Fordham’s mission is deeply rooted in the Jesuit principle of ** cura personalis**—the care of the whole person. The University’s commitment is demonstrated to our dedicated employees, who are the heart and backbone of our institution, through our various wellness programs. We recognize that an engaged, productive, and thriving University community is built upon the well-being of its faculty and staff. Therefore, prioritizing employee wellness is not merely a benefit—it is a strategic imperative and an expression of our core values.

Our University is committed to its employees' wellness by offering them healthier living and community-building programs addressing their physical, mental, and financial well-being. Our wellness programs are designed to provide our employees with the tools, resources, and supportive environment needed to lead healthier, balanced lives both at work and at home.

The programs offered reflect this comprehensive approach, including:

**Physical Health:**Programs such as Yoga, Weight Training, Onsite Physical Exams, Onsite Flu Vaccines, Citibike Memberships, and Walking Challenges promote physical activity and preventative care.**Mind-Body Balance:**Offerings such as Meditation by Calm City, Reflexology, and Massage provide essential outlets for stress reduction and mental rejuvenation.**Nutrition and Lifestyle:**Resources like EatLove and Husk guide healthy eating and sustainable lifestyle choices.**Financial Security:**Vendor-supported Financial Webinars, as well as one-on-one opportunities to discuss their future in-person or virtually with financial experts, equip our employees with the knowledge to build a secure economic future, completing the circle of holistic well-being.
