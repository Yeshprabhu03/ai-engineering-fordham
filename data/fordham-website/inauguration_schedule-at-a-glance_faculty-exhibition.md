**The New York State Fair in Syracuse is the oldest in the nation and draws over a million visitors a year during its roughly two-week run concluding on Labor Day. For central New Yorkers, it marks the last hurrah of summer and the start of fall. As a child, I went to the fair with my family; as a teenager, I worked at one of the food concessions; and since the early 1980s, I have gone with a camera to photograph. Over the past 40 years, I have returned to Syracuse and tried to go as many days as circumstances allow, regardless of where I might be. The photographs are a small selection printed this summer from a growing archive.**

**Supported by a Smithsonian Artist Research Fellowship, Ruble’s Red Summer: A look at, and away from, America’s deadliest year of interracial violence through a re-rendering of the forty-seven portraits from that year in the collection of the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery is a series of 47 small-scale, ink-on-paper paintings, accompanied by an artist book. The project stands as a form of institutional critique, calling attention to the National Portrait Gallery’s lack of representation of people of color and implicitly asking: Whom have we been missing? The 2022 Faculty Spotlight Exhibition includes Ruble’s book and a selection of pieces from the Red Summer series.**

**I make paintings that live on the wildly permeable boundaries of image and abstraction since moving to New York from California many years ago. I arrived in New York with a love of picture making, anecdote, and exuberant color, which were key elements of the Bay Area regionalism that shaped my work as a young painter. I continue to make abstract configurations that function as unique image while simultaneously presenting a non-literal and compelling theater of paint, color, and space. Painting is the proper forum for the implication of an entire world. These worlds can offer an endless, timeless vista seeming to have solid boundaries but presenting none. My paintings completely occupy a regenerated “present” with every viewing.**
