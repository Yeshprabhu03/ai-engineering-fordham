**The Preservation Hall Jazz Band **has been celebrating the inimitable music of their native New Orleans for decades with a lineup featuring generations of the city’s most exciting players. Double bass and tuba player Ben Jaffe leads this seven-piece group whose home base is the venerable French Quarter venue and nonprofit foundation that gives them their name. They’ll be making a rare New York appearance as part of a tour celebrating their 60th anniversary.

**Rén with the Mane** is a captivating Brooklyn-based artist who makes vibrant pop music with touches of rock and soul. Her music was first played on WFUV’s daily local music feature, “NY Slice.” She also won the theme song contest, and her jingle is now heard each day before the feature. Rén and her band put on a mesmerizing live show.

This in-studio performance shows off their collective talents:
