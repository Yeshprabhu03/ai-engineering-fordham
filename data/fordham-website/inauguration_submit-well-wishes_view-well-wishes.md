Hello, President Tania Tetlow. Even though I am retiring this spring after putting my career in the hands of Fordham as a psych professor since 1990, I will be on campus and continuing research hopefully as an emeritus professor and have a chance to meet you. I wish you the very best and can tell you that the faculty are generous, most intelligent, and very kind. You will enjoy getting to know them. I applaud Fordham for appointing a woman lay president; it speaks well for Fordham’s move into the present and future. Best wishes.

President Tetlow, I am so impressed with you and all of the traditions you have shattered that marginalize opportunities for women. Professional roles of all kinds generally come with too many restrictions and barriers. Just before you were hired, who could have ever imagined that a woman would lead Fordham? Brava to you. I’m sorry that our paths just missed, but I will be following your remarkable journey as an alum. Congratulations and thank you for being a barrier breaker.

I serve within the De La Salle Christian Brothers as a consultant for school governing boards across the Lasallian network. I am in residence at the Manhattan College Brothers' Community. I look forward to being at the Fordham campus in the near future and would welcome the opportunity to bring my greetings to you in person. God Bless!

Congratulations, President Tetlow! I had the honor of attending your inauguration and it was an incredibly moving experience. Your speech truly resonated with me and it is clear that you are the perfect person to lead the University at this time. My connections to Fordham run deep and I have never been prouder of my alma mater. I am a graduate of Fordham College at Rose Hill (FCRH), Class of ’87 (and currently working towards an M.S.W. at Fordham), the mom of three amazing daughters (one who graduated in 2018, and another is graduating this year—both FCRH), and I am married to a Fordham grad, FCRH, Class of ’86. Both my mother-in-law and father-in-law are Fordham grads, as are two sisters-in-law and one brother-in-law. I wish you much success and look forward to supporting you and your administration as you help Fordham to continue to grow and evolve to meet the needs of today’s students, faculty, and staff during this incredibly challenging time. I welcome you and your family to the Ramily!

Attending your Missioning Mass was like participating in the Easter vigil. For as the congregation renews its baptismal vows as it welcomes catechumens to the faith, so we were invited to renew our commitment to Fordham’s mission as you made your promise. As you take on the tasks of the presidency, know that a community stands behind you together committed to our university’s mission. Congratulations!

*—Michael Lee**Director, Francis and Ann Curran Center for American Catholic Studies**Professor of Theology*

As a young woman in this field, it is a privilege to witness so many firsts here, but most importantly, our first female president.
