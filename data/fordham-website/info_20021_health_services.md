## Health Services Mission Statement

University Health Services provides accessible and high-quality health care services to Fordham University Students. It is our goal that students will develop an understanding of dealing with their own health, both physical and mental. We provide education to students with the expectation that this knowledge will enable them to live healthy lifestyles, promote wellness, and enable them to achieve academically, spiritually, and socially. Our medical team recognizes and welcomes the uniqueness of our students and we respect human diversity in all its forms. We are members of the Ally Network of Support and we are committed to providing an inclusive environment for all. We assist our students in developing moral and ethical values and characteristics that reflect the Jesuit tradition in regard to health promotion and illness prevention.
