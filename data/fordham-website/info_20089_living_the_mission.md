Who we are determines what we do. We seek knowledge and engage with society. We strive to find God in all things and all people. We are committed to the spirit of inquiry and curiosity even when—especially when—we don’t know where the answers will take us.

A Jesuit education means living a life beyond self, as [people for others](/about/living-the-mission/diversity-and-inclusion/), helping to feed the hungry, clothe the poor, heal the sick. Service is a critical part of who we are - so much so that it’s built into our curricula.

At Fordham, service forges the person you become. We hear it all the time from our alumni and current students: Fordham gives them the tools to not only make a positive change in themselves, but also a positive change in the world.
