### Specialized Practice Certificates for On-Campus Students

Looking to separate yourself in the social work job market? Fordham GSS offers two specialized practice certificates (SPCs) for on-campus students that can help you stand out throughout your career search and find the role best suited for your abilities.

- Specialized Practice Certificate in Health
- Specialized Practice Certificate in Crisis and Resilience

On-campus students can choose one SPC to complete simultaneously with their MSW degree. To receive the certificate, students must complete three applicable courses.

**Read more below about the SPCs currently offered:**

-
The Specialized Practice Certificate in Health aims to prepare students to work in a diverse range of health care settings. Students will develop applied knowledge and skills to help individuals, families, groups, communities, and organizations address health and well-being. By obtaining this certificate, students will acquire specialized knowledge of our contemporary health care system, including current issues in policy and practice. The certificate will focus on promoting rights and justice to prepare students to advocate for change within the evolving health care environment. It equips social work students with the essential skills and competencies needed to work in the health care field, including as part of a multidisciplinary health care team, and across health care systems.

All the courses in this certificate will articulate the role of social work practitioners in health care, emphasizing effective interprofessional practice. Students will use the person-in-environment framework to critically evaluate the role of culture, social determinants of health, and intersectionality in health and health outcomes. Students will learn effective approaches to engaging in collaborative, person-centered health-focused interventions and treatment with individuals, groups, families and communities. Specifically, this will include attention to assessment methods, evidence-based practice, and policies across various health settings and populations.

-
The purpose of the Specialized Practice Certificate in Crisis & Resilience is to train students to respond to and prepare for work with individuals, families, groups, communities, and policymakers in the event of crises such as natural disasters, pandemics, terrorism, shootings, or other traumatic events. Students will develop applied knowledge and skills needed to engage, assess, intervene, and evaluate during and after crises and advocate for policies that would diminish unnecessary risks in societies.

Students will use the person-in-environment framework to learn how different policies, communities, and individuals are potentially affected due to existing inequities, intersectionality, and vulnerabilities. Students will learn to promote situational awareness, problem-solving skills, coping, and emotional resilience to restore functioning after a crisis. The certificate will focus on promoting rights and justice to prepare students to advocate for change within a crisis environment. It equips social work students with the essential skills and competencies needed to work in the crisis field, including as part of a multidisciplinary team and across systems.

Whether engaging in planning to mitigate potential crises and their impact or responding during and after crises, specific skills needed are planning and conducting a thorough biopsychosocial and risk assessment; using evidence-based interventions; establishing a collaborative relationship across disciplines; restoring function through the implementation of an action plan, and evaluation and follow-up. The courses for this certificate provide students with the skills needed to carry out these responsibilities on micro, mezzo, and macro levels.
