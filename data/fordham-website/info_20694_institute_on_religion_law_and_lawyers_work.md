## Religious Lawyering: Defining Our Terms

What characterizes the "religious lawyering" conversation is its focus on how religious values and perspectives may provide a completely different structural framework for an approach to professional life

Religious lawyering insists that there should be room in the profession for lawyers to integrate religious perspectives and substantive critiques to the issues which arise not just at the margins, but at the heart of ordinary day-to-day legal practice.

It suggests that this is a conversation to be held not just within the quiet of one's individual conscience, but as an open dialogue and debate in law offices, in judge's chambers, in legislatures, and even in law schools.
