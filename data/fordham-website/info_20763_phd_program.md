Doctoral student, Lisa Betty, received an Archival Research Fellowship for her work on the Afro-Caribbean diaspora in Guantánamo and the Black Cuban diaspora in the Bronx.

With a wealth of top cultural institutions and abundant archival resources, New York City is an exciting place for the aspiring historian. As a doctoral student at Fordham, you’ll have all of the advantages of a big cosmopolitan city while enjoying the small intimate scale of our university. Our doctoral program is personalized and student oriented. At Fordham we believe that research and teaching go hand in hand in sharpening your scholarship and assuring that your work has an impact.

Renowned for our medieval program, the history department is also particularly strong in global history; the history of science, technology, and medicine; and urban history. You’ll thrive in our small, seminar-style classes and benefit from intensive one-on-one training with a faculty mentor.

You’ll choose from one of two tracks:

**Medieval history**focusing on the history of Europe from the collapse of the Roman Empire to the 15th century**Modern history**encompassing any period from 1500 to present, with subject areas in Europe, the Americas, Asia, and global history

Unlike larger universities where doctoral students serve as teaching assistants, you’ll teach your own undergraduate classes. As a Fordham Ph.D. you will develop your teaching skills in a one-on-one pedagogy course and then teach your own class starting in your third year. You will design your own syllabus, give lectures, run discussions, as well as grade and advise undergraduates.
