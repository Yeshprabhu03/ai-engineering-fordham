Fordham’s M.A. in History gives you the tools and guidance to investigate the fascinating world of the past.

Whether your subject of interest is medieval medicine, American slavery, or European trade networks, our program has a large, diverse faculty and offers a broad range of topics and methodologies. You’ll choose from one of two concentrations:

**Medieval history**focuses on the history of Europe from the collapse of the Roman Empire to the 15th century.**Modern history**focuses on Europe and the Americas, and encompassing any period from 1500 to present.

In the spirit of the Jesuit principle of *cura personalis*—care for the whole person—you’ll receive the personal attention you need to hone your unique skills and produce scholarship of the highest quality. The master's is personalized and student oriented with opportunities to develop individualized tutorials with leading experts in your chosen field of study. M.A. students take courses with Ph.D. students and fully participate in the intellectual life of the History Department.
