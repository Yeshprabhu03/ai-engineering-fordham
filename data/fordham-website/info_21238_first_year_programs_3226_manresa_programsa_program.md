Manresa students are enrolled in a course taught by one of Fordham's most talented professor-scholars. Each professor also serves as the academic advisor and intellectual mentor to each student.

The Residence Hall Staff in Loyola Hall consists of one full-time resident director, four resident assistants, four academic live-in tutors, and one Jesuit priest-in-residence. This staff complements the [academic experience](/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/academics/living-and-learning-communities/manresa-program/course-offerings/) by expanding each resident’s intellectual, spiritual, and social growth within the residential setting through a variety of [regular and enriching programs](/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/academics/living-and-learning-communities/manresa-program/event-highlights/).
