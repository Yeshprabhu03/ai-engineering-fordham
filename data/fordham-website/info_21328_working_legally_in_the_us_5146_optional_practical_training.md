### How to Apply for OPT:

-
If you are applying for OPT, please access the online OPT Application Portal for document submission.

Please use your Fordham email to access the Portal. You may log in as a returning user or create an account.

You will be prompted to enter pertinent information for your application, send a Certificate of Completion request to your Academic Advisor/Class Dean, and submit the necessary documents for us to review. You will be able to save your application progress and continue the application if you need to finish at a later time.

**OIS advisors will be reviewing and handling these cases as soon as possible. Your application documents must be complete for us to begin action on your case, so please make sure to submit all requested documents in the application portal.** -
Wait for OIS to Review Submitted Documents and Give You Next Steps.

Once you submit all of your documents via the OPT Portal and pay the fee, you will receive a message from the application platform via email saying that you have finished the document submission process. Due to volume, please

**allow 10 business days**for an advisor to get back to you with feedback.OIS will notify you via email once your "OPT Application Package" is available online. The OPT Package will include:

- Your New I-20 with OPT Recommendation.
- A guide for filing Form I-765 online with USCIS.

[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#335c5a4073555c41575b525e1d565746). -
Along with the New I-20 with OPT recommendation, you will receive detailed instructions for filing Form I-765 (OPT application) online with USCIS.

You must file Form I-765 with USCIS within 30 days of the date OIS recommended the post-completion OPT in SEVIS.


### After Filing Form I-765 Online with USCIS

Within one month of your application, a receipt notice (I-797C, Notice of Action) will arrive at your mailing address. This notice is also accessible in your online USCIS portal within 48hrs of submission. You can continue to check the status of your application via your USCIS account.

### After You Receive Your Receipt Notice

[Check your OPT Application Case Status Online](https://egov.uscis.gov/casestatus/landing.do) or via your USCIS account.

An OPT application normally takes about 1-3 months to get approved by USCIS, starting from the date USCIS receives an application. Consequently, OIS encourages students to apply for OPT as early as possible and remain patient during the waiting period.

However, if you have been waiting for over 4 months to receive your card, you may make an E-Request on the USCIS website to check your case status. If your case has been pending for over 5 months, please contact OIS at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#345b5d4774525b46505c55591a515041) so our office can make a direct inquiry with USCIS.
