# United Nations

Fordham University is a non-governmental organization (NGO) associated with the United Nations Department of Public Information (UNDPI). As an NGO associated with UNDPI, the Fordham community has access to the weekly briefings that they sponsor. Fordham students are able to apply for internships to represent associated NGOs in these briefings.

**Academic Impact**

Fordham University is a partner in United Nations Academic Impact, a global initiative that connects the UN with universities to pursue and sustain ten principles. Each year, Fordham must actively demonstrate its support for at least one of these principles.

Fordham offers students unique opportunities at the UN through its Impact Initiative, internships, and briefings, including access to special events such as International Peace Day, UN Day and International Education Week.
