The mission of the Career Planning Center is to empower and support the J.D. students and J.D. alumni of Fordham Law in their career-related endeavors. The CPC fulfills its mission by providing effective guidance and counseling to J.D. students and J.D. alumni so that they may engage in meaningful job searches, develop as professionals, and make informed career-related choices leading to long-term career satisfaction. To accomplish these goals, members of the career planning staff begin their relationship with J.D. students in mid-October of the first year and are available to them throughout their careers.
