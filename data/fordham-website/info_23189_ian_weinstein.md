Ian Weinstein was the fourth full-time clinical legal educator to join the Fordham faculty, in 1991, and has played a key role in the growth of the clinical legal education program since then. In 2006, he was appointed director of clinical legal education and four years later was named the School’s first associate dean for clinical and experiential programs. That same year he began his service to the Clinical Legal Education Association. In 2007, Law Clinic TV, a video blog he published, received the NALP Award of Distinction for Technology. He is the founding director of the Brendan Moore Trial Advocacy Center. Prior to joining Fordham, he was the Stiller/Prettyman Fellow at Georgetown Law School and then associate attorney with the Federal Defenders of the Legal Aid Society for the Southern District of New York.
