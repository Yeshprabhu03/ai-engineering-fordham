John C. Seitz focuses on the historical and ethnographic study of U.S. Catholics and on theoretical questions in the study of religion. He is currently working on a book about Roman Catholic priesthood in the 20th century U.S.

In his teaching Seitz treats U.S. religious history, theories in the study of religion and theology, and the history of Christianity in the modern period. Among his courses are “American Religious Texts” and “Faith & Critical Reason,” both of which contribute to the undergraduate core curriculum. Electives and courses for the major have included “Christian Thought and Practice,” “Wartime Religion in U.S. History,” “Contemporary Conversations in Theology,” “Home, Away, and In-Between,” and “Catholic Studies Seminar.” Seitz also teaches "Writing Religion," “Readings in American Religion” and “History of Christianity” and a range of tutorials for the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
