Dr. Lee’s research centers on how Christian reflection intersects with movements for justice. He investigates how Christian theology might spur action for justice, and how in turn, engagement in struggles for justice leads to reexamination of Christian thought.

A central focus of his research for the past two decades has been on liberation theology coming from El Salvador, and particularly, on the life and work of important figures: the Jesuit martyr-priest and president of the

*Universidad Centroamericana José Simeón Cañas*, Ignacio Ellacuría and the martyred-Archbishop of San Salvador and now canonized saint, Óscar Romero.His first book,

*Bearing the Weight of Salvation*, identified how Ellacuría’s philosophy, Christology, and account of discipleship are woven together to provide a distinctive liberationist account of salvation, and then it placed this soteriology in critical dialogue with authors of the “radical orthodoxy.”Dr. Lee then edited

*Ignacio Ellacuría: Essays on History, Liberation, and Salvation*(Orbis, 2013) providing an English-speaking audience access to a collection of Ellacuría’s most substantial theological essays.His most recent book,

*Revolutionary Saint*(Orbis, 2018) explores the legacy of the newly canonized Saint Óscar Romero of El Salvador. By examining Archbishop Romero’s context, life, and theological works, Dr. Lee offers a historical reassessment of the Latin American church after Vatican II and Medellín as well as the church’s role in period leading to the Salvadoran civil war. Theologically, it demonstrates how Romero’s theology overcomes the dualistic and fatalistic tendencies of colonial Catholicism and offers a vision of Christianity as the faithful and historical taking up of Jesus’ mission as a preferential option for the poor.In addition to this work, Dr. Lee has also published various pieces on Christology and salvation, particularly as this reflection is done from a U.S. Latinx perspective.
