Aristotle Papanikolaou’s areas of expertise are Eastern Orthodox theology, Trinitarian theology, and political theology. He is currently developing an expertise on the relation between theological anthropology, violence and virtue ethics.

His on-going research interests include contemporary Orthodox theology (nineteenth and twentieth centuries), Trinitarian theology, and political theology. His current research agenda relates to theological anthropology, and specifically how the Christian notion of theosis affects our understanding of what it means to be human. As a theotic theological anthropology, he is interested in the question of how theosis can illuminate understandings of identity, sin, virtue, the communication of grace, and a relational understanding of personhood.
