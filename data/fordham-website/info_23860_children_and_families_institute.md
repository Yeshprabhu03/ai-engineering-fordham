# Children and Families Institute


Children and Families Institute supports agency-based practitioners to promote practice innovation in agencies and organizations serving children and families.

Founded in 1988 and housed at the Westchester Campus of Fordham University Graduate School of Social Service (GSS), Children and Families Institute:

- Offers quality training and professional development activities that advance state-of-the-art knowledge and social work skills. Training includes identifying child abuse, neglect, and maltreatment, as well as its investigation, assessment, intervention, coordination and treatment; mental health, substance abuse, HIV, domestic violence, sexual abuse, educational disabilities, supervisory training, service to school-age children and adolescents and permanency planning.
- Undertakes intervention research and evaluates practice and program initiatives. Research projects occur across the spectrum from needs assessment and program evaluation to intervention and outcome research.
- Supports emerging evidenced-based, family-focused, and community-centered developments in the family and children’s services field. Needs assessment, program development, demonstration projects, research, and program evaluation are available to public and private entities desiring the development of new services or evaluation of current practice approaches.

Children and Families Institute draws on faculty from Fordham’s Graduate School of Social Service as well as professional consultants from the field of social work, psychology, education, medicine, and the law. We offer these resources and expertise to national, state, local and professional organizations.
