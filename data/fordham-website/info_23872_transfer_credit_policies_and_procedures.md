[Transfer Equivalency Self-Service (TESS)](https://dw-prod.ec.fordham.edu/DWTE)is a tool designed to help prospective transfer students determine how their transfer credits may be accepted at Fordham and how those credits may apply toward an intended degree.**Step 1: Create an Account**so that you can save your preliminary degree audit and return to it at a later date to update your selections or share with your college’s transfer advisor. Only prospective transfer students should create an account. If you are a counselor, parent, or other community member, please utilize the ‘Continue without signing in’ option.**Step 2: Answer a few questions about when you wish to transfer and what your intended major is.**- Enrollment Dates: Select the term in which you plan to enter Fordham
- Intended Level: Select Undergraduate
- Intended Degree: Select either Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Fine Arts, or Bachelor of Science
- If your intended college is Fordham College at Lincoln Center, you may select BA, BFA, or BS
- If your intended college is Fordham College at Rose Hill, you may select BA or BS
- If your intended college is the Gabelli School of Business, please select BS

- Intended College: Depending on your Intended Degree, select either Fordham College at Lincoln Center, Fordham College at Rose Hill, or the Gabelli School of Business
- Intended Major: Select the major you plan to pursue
- Intended Concentration: Select if you plan to pursue a major in Business Administration or Global Business in the Gabelli School of Business. Otherwise, select ‘None’
- Intended Minor: Select a minor you plan to pursue. This is an optional field.

**Step 3: Select your institution and class information**- Search for the name of your college/university. Search for ‘Advanced Placement’ if you wish to add AP scores.
- Select the course you have completed or will complete. For each course, you will be required to enter the term you wish to enroll at Fordham, number of credit hours received/expected, final grade received/expected, and the type of credits earned (semester, trimester, or quarter hours).
- Select ‘Add another class from this school’ or select ‘Proceed’.
- Repeat this step so that courses from all institutions you have previously attended or currently attend are included.

At this time, we are able to provide transfer credit information for a limited number of institutions. If your institution is not listed, or if you cannot find a specific class in the database, you will find out how your credits transfer after you have applied and been admitted. Additional institutions and classes are regularly added to the transfer database.

**Step 4: Review your preliminary transfer credit evaluation and degree audit**- The results page will indicate how your courses will be accepted for transfer credit and how these courses will apply toward your intended degree.
- Download and save the PDF of your degree audit. If you are admitted as a transfer student, you may provide this document to the Director of Transfer Students for Fordham College Rose Hill & Lincoln Center or Transfer Dean for Gabelli School of Business.
- If you have created an account, save your work by clicking on the disk icon in the top right hand corner of the website.

Please note that the preliminary transfer credit evaluation and degree audit is not official. The degree audit should be used as a guide to help you understand how your courses taken at previous institutions may transfer to Fordham and apply toward your degree requirements. Official transfer credit evaluations are not completed until you have been admitted and have submitted official transcripts. At the time of admission, you will be connected with the Director of Transfer Students for Fordham College Rose Hill & Lincoln Center or Transfer Dean for Gabelli School of Business, who will assist you in this process. Please contact

[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4a3e382b24392c2f380a2c25382e222b27642f2e3f)with any questions.*This tool is for prospective transfer students. Current students must contact their advisor/class dean to request approval before taking coursework outside of Fordham.* -
Prior to applying, a student attending another college or university may utilize our

[transfer credit equivalency database](https://dw-prod.ec.fordham.edu/DWTE)to determine how their credits are transferable. At this time, we are able to provide transfer credit information for a limited number of institutions. Please refer to the above section for more information.

If your institution is not listed in our database, or if you cannot find a specific class in the database, you will find out how your credits transfer after you have applied and been admitted. At that time, we will connect you with the Director of Transfer Students for Fordham College Rose Hill & Lincoln Center or Transfer Dean for Gabelli School of Business, who will provide you a transfer credit evaluation of all previous courses completed.

We encourage admitted students to wait to submit an enrollment deposit until after their transfer credit evaluation has been completed. -
Admitted transfer students will receive a Preliminary Transfer Credit Evaluation (P-TCE) within 2-3 weeks after being admitted. In addition, a transfer student's online admission letter provides the contact information for the Director of Transfer Students for Fordham College Rose Hill & Lincoln Center or Transfer Dean for Gabelli School of Business. Admitted transfer students should contact the Director of Transfer Students for Fordham College Rose Hill & Lincoln Center or the Transfer Dean for Gabelli School of Business with any questions regarding their P-TCE.

If you attend an institution that can be found in our

[Transfer Equivalency Self-Service (TESS)](https://dw-prod.ec.fordham.edu/DWTE?_ga=2.131821583.1819228075.1727658609-916336321.1694007501)tool, your P-TCE will be prepared according to the information in TESS. We recommend that you save a copy of your degree audit when using TESS and provide this to the Director of Transfer Students for Fordham College Rose Hill & Lincoln Center or Transfer Dean for Gabelli School of Business upon admission.The Director of Transfer Students for Fordham College Rose Hill & Lincoln Center or Transfer Dean for Gabelli School of Business will determine which courses will transfer to fulfill Fordham's core curriculum requirements.

Fordham University accepts a maximum of 60 credit hours towards degree completion in our three undergraduate colleges (Fordham College at Lincoln Center, Fordham College at Rose Hill, and the Gabelli School of Business). Students are required to complete at least two years of full-time coursework, for a total of 120-124 credits (depending on the program), in order to receive a Fordham degree. Students who have over 60 credit hours may instead consider applying to Fordham’s

[School of Professional and Continuing Studies](/school-of-professional-and-continuing-studies/).

Approved courses taken at a regionally accredited two-year or four-year college or university will likely transfer to Fordham as either core curriculum credit or elective credit if the courses meet the below criteria. Fordham also accepts AP and IB coursework for transfer students.**Courses will be considered for transfer if:**- 3 or more credit hours
- Grade received is a C or higher (2.0 or above on a 4.0 scale)
- Pass/Fail grades will be accepted and considered for credit for students completing Spring 2020 and Summer 2020 coursework only. Pass/fail grades will not be accepted or considered for credit for students completing coursework before Spring 2020 or from Fall 2020 and beyond
- Online coursework will be accepted and considered for credit for students completing Spring 2020, Summer 2020, Fall 2020, Spring 2021, Summer 2021, Fall 2021, and Spring 2022 coursework
- Course description is similar to a course offered at Fordham. Often, if a course is not similar to courses offered at Fordham, the class may still be transferable as elective credit
- Course is approved by the Director of Transfer Students for Fordham College Rose Hill & Lincoln Center or Transfer Dean for Gabelli School of Business

**Courses will not be considered for transfer if:**- Grade is lower than a C (below a 2.0 on a 4.0 scale)
- Course has fewer than 3 credits (certain science labs may be accepted)
- Please see our college coursework policy for courses taken prior to high school graduation, such as dual enrollment
- Course is not approved by the Director of Transfer Students for Fordham College Rose Hill & Lincoln Center or Transfer Dean for Gabelli School of Business
- Course credit is for a prior learning experience, including, but not limited to, U.S. Armed Forces credit, and CLEP or DANTES examination results

**Will my GPA transfer or will I start with a new GPA at Fordham?**A student's GPA from Fordham will be based on the student's performance in Fordham courses alone. Grades from previous institutions will not be included in the calculation of a Fordham GPA. -
In general, we advise prospective transfer students to focus on completing college coursework that will fulfill requirements in Fordham’s robust core curriculum. This will ensure a higher likelihood of your coursework being accepted for transfer credit. If a student pursues coursework within a specific major prior to Fordham, we advise that you focus on introductory classes, as more advanced level classes within a major may be more challenging to transfer.


Additionally, we recommend students seeking advice on what courses to take at their current college or university to consult with their current academic advisors.**Fordham College at Lincoln Center and Fordham College at Rose Hill Applicants**We encourage students who are pursuing majors in the liberal arts and sciences to review the below resources as a guide. This information will allow you to explore the requirements for graduation at Fordham, and then select similar coursework at your current institution.

Resources:[Core Curriculum General Information](/academics/undergraduate-education/core-curriculum/)[Academic Bulletin Core Curriculum Requirements](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/undergraduate/fordham-college-core-curriculum/#text)[Fordham College at Lincoln Center Major and Minor Requirements](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/undergraduate/lincoln-center/#text)[Fordham College at Rose Hill Major and Minor Requirements](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/undergraduate/rose-hill/)

Please note that all students pursuing a Bachelor of Arts (with the exception of psychology majors enrolled in the pre-health program) must complete a foreign language requirement. Students are required to take a language placement exam, which will place them in the appropriate language requirement sequence. In order to fulfill the language requirement, a student must complete all courses in the sequence leading up to and including an exit-level (2001) course. Typically, most transfer students do not have the required foreign language sequence complete when transferring.


**Gabelli School of Business Applicants**We encourage students who are pursuing majors in business to review the below resources as a guide. This information will allow you to explore the requirements for graduation at Fordham, and then select coursework at your current institution that is similar.

Please refer to our Gabelli Transfer Admission Requirements section for more detailed information. A student must have the prerequisite courses completed prior to their entry to Fordham University.



Please note that the Gabelli School of Business has two different core curriculums running simultaneously. If it is at all possible, students will be placed in the Integrated Business Core curriculum as seen in the information links above. In the event that transferring into this curriculum causes a significant loss of transfer credits, students will only at this time be placed in our Traditional Business Core curriculum. -
Admitted transfer students will receive a formal Preliminary Transfer Credit Evaluation (P-TCE) about two weeks after being admitted. The P-TCE document will be issued to you via email. Admitted transfer students should follow up on their P-TCE by contacting the Dean/Director indicated in their admission letter. Students who have previously completed coursework at international universities must have their transcripts evaluated by WES before contacting the dean. This can be done before or after depositing.

Fordham’s

[Gabelli School of Business](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/undergraduate-programs/)offers distinct programs at each of our two New York City[campuses](/undergraduate-admission/why-fordham/a-new-york-education/). Students select only one campus (the[Gabelli School of Business at Rose Hill](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/undergraduate-programs/which-campus/rose-hill/)or the[Gabelli School of Business at Lincoln Center](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/undergraduate-programs/which-campus/lincoln-center/)) and a corresponding major on their application. Applications are accepted for both the fall and spring semesters. All Gabelli School of Business students complete a liberal arts core, a business core, a major and concentration, and electives. More information about the curriculum can be found in our[course bulletin](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/undergraduate/gabelli-business/academic-curriculum/).A key semester in the Gabelli School program –on either campus– is called the consulting challenge. During this semester, students take their initial courses in finance, marketing, management, and business communications. The students are placed onto teams of five or six students and each team is assigned a company which they spend the entire semester analyzing by using what they are learning in these courses. At Lincoln Center, this important set of integrated courses is only offered in the Fall semester. Transfer students who already have credit for one or more of these courses

should only apply to the Rose Hill program where they can earn a bachelor’s degree in business without completing the consulting challenge semester at Fordham.**Applying to the Gabelli School of Business at Rose Hill**

The vast majority of transfer applicants who apply for a business program apply to the Rose Hill campus as multiple majors are offered.*Admission Requirements*

To be eligible to apply, an applicant must have completed one of the following:- High school Precalculus, Calculus, AP Calculus (AB or BC), IB Math
**OR**College level Algebra, Pre-calculus, Calculus, or Finite Math

The following college classes are recommended for applicants to the Gabelli School of Business at Rose Hill, but are not required for admission purposes:

- Basic Macroeconomics
- Basic Microeconomics
- Statistics
- Precalculus, Calculus, Finite Math, or College Algebra (one of these math courses is required for admission if the applicant has not completed high school Pre-calculus, Calculus, AP Calculus, or IB Math)

The Gabelli School of Business at Lincoln Center offers three majors: Finance, Marketing and Digital Media & Technology (DM&T). The last of these, DM&T, includes the choice of a concentration either in Media Management or Information Technology. All three majors are STEM-designated majors.**Applying to the Gabelli School of Business at Lincoln Center**The program welcomes a very small incoming transfer class each semester so availability is typically limited and admission is very selective. There are specific academic requirements that applicants must meet in order to be eligible for this competitive program. Should an applicant not be admitted to the program at Lincoln Center, the Committee on Admission may elect to offer the applicant the opportunity to be considered for an alternate college choice. The Gabelli School of Business at Rose Hill offers a similar – but slightly more extensive - list of majors.

*Admission Requirements*Applicants planning to enroll in the Gabelli School of Business at Lincoln Center, will need to either bring with them credit for the following – or complete the following courses prior to taking the consulting challenge semester (

**which is only offered in the Fall at the Gabelli School of Business at Lincoln Center**):- College level Finite Math (or Business Finite Math)

- College level Basic Macroeconomics
*** - College level Basic Microeconomics
***** - College level Statistics
*(AP credit is not accepted – but earns elective credit only)* - College level Financial Accounting
******

*****AP credit accepted with a score of 4 or 5******In order to receive credit forFinancial Accounting, a student must also pass a placement exam when they arrive to Fordham – a one-page review sheet is available to assist the student to prepare for this placement exam.*If an applicant is missing one or two of the required courses listed above, arrangements might be made with the Assistant Dean for Transfers at the Gabelli School of Business at Lincoln Center to ensure you will complete the needed requirements during the summer before starting at Fordham.* - High school Precalculus, Calculus, AP Calculus (AB or BC), IB Math

Applicants interested in pursuing Dance or Theatre as a major must audition as part of the application process. Please see the Dance and Theatre department websites for details on the audition process.

-
Please refer to our

[International students website](/undergraduate-admission/international-students/)for detailed information. -
Current Fordham students who wish to transfer colleges within Fordham should speak to the Academic Advising Center to discuss the internal transfer process.

-
Any applicant who graduated from high school or received a high school equivalency diploma, who completed or will complete coursework at a 2 or 4 year regionally accredited college or university at the time of application, and who intends to enroll full-time (15 credit hours per semester) in one of Fordham’s three undergraduate colleges to pursue a bachelors degree qualifies as a transfer applicant. A student must meet all of these criteria to be considered a transfer applicant.

Any student who earns college credit after completing a secondary school diploma is considered a transfer student, regardless of the number of credits completed. Both matriculated and non-matriculated students who earn credit will be considered a transfer. If you have audited a class or completed non credit coursework, then you may be considered an incoming first year student. Typically, students who complete language intensive classes, who do not earn credit, are considered an incoming first year student.

Students who begin their studies at a college or university and withdraw prior to earning credit must contact the Office of Admission via email at

[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#31545f435e5d5d71575e435559505c1f545544)to confirm their status. In order to be considered as a first year, a student must withdraw prior to the add/drop date at the institution they attended and provide official documentation (college transcript, withdrawal form) indicating the date of their withdrawal. In addition, to be considered a first year, the student must not have had any financial aid disbursed from the federal government while at the college or university that he or she attended.The Office of Admission will exercise professional judgment and consider each student’s circumstances to ensure that, regardless of status (first year or transfer), the best interest of the student’s needs are met related to enrollment.

Who should not apply as a transfer applicant?

- Non Traditional Students
- Some applicants apply as traditional undergraduate transfer applicants but should consider applying to Fordham through Fordham’s School of Professional and Continuing Studies (PCS). Applicants who are returning to school after more than a year off, who have significant life experience after high school graduation, who work full-time, who have attended several (3 or more) colleges and universities since high school graduation, who have more than 60 credit hours of college coursework completed, or who have served in the military are encouraged to explore the educational options offered by
[Fordham’s PCS](https://www.fordham.edu/school-of-professional-and-continuing-studies/). This encouragement is not to prevent applicants from applying as a traditional transfer student but to ensure they have explored the best possible options academically, financially and socially for their future. Please read the section below on PCS or follow the link for more information on the advantages of enrolling in Fordham’s PCS.
