A.B., Brown University, Biology, 1993


Masters Certificate, University of Georgia, Conservation Biology, 2002

Ph.D., University of Georgia, Botany, 2002

Research Associate, USDA Invasive Plant Research Lab, 2002-2004

Postdoctoral Researcher, University of California, Irvine, 2004-2007 -
I study plant ecology and ecological genetics and am particularly interested in rapid, contemporary evolution. I work on topics such as evolutionary responses to climate change and evolution in invasive species. One of the main approaches I use for studying evolution is the resurrection approach of comparing ancestors and descendants under common conditions. My research combines field work, greenhouse and lab experiments, and quantitative and molecular genetics and genomics. I focus on testing key components of contemporary ecological and evolutionary theory with the goal of attaining a more complete understanding of evolution in natural systems.

[Project Baseline](http://www.baselineseedbank.org/)

This NSF-funded multi-collaborator effort entails collecting seeds of key species throughout North America in a way that will allow the use of ancestor-descendant comparisons ( Franks et al. 2008) to investigate evolution in natural populations in response to ongoing changes in climate.**The Genetic Basis of Climate Change Adaptation**

Following the first study to demonstrate rapid evolution in a natural plant population in response to a change in climate ( Franks et al. 2007), I am currently investigating the genetic basis of evolutionary changes in flowering time in the annual plant*Brassica rapa*(field mustard).**Other Projects**Other projects in the lab involve examining evolution in invasive and introduced species, evolution of herbicide and herbivory resistance, and plant reproductive ecology and evolution.**Opportunities**

Graduate and undergraduate positions may be available for work on these and other projects. For more information, please contact me ([[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#325440535c594172545d40565a535f1c575647)). -
