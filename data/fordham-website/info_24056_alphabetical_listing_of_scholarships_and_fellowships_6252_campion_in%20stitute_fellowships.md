# Campion Institute Fellowships

## Overview:

Each year, the Campion Institute offers awards to undergraduate and graduate students who have applied for and will be applying for competitive external scholarships and fellowships (e.g., Boren, Critical Language Scholarship, Gilman, Goldwater, Marshall, Mitchell, NSF GRFP, Rhodes, Truman, etc.)

The Campion Fellowships typically fund activities that involve research, international study, teaching English as a second language, and/or community service. The selection committee is especially interested in proposals for medium- and long-term activities that include cultural immersion or independent research.

The specific terms of each award are determined on a case-by-case basis, and usually include a small stipend, summer housing, or a combination of both.

The selection committee prioritizes applications from students

- early in their time at Fordham
- who have applied for and are planning to apply for competitive external scholarships
- whose academic background is a good match for their future career goals
- studying subjects that are underrepresented in the Fordham fellowships process

If you are unsure whether or not you should apply, please do apply!

There are two application deadlines:

- December 5th - for Winter and Spring activities
- May 1st - for Summer and Fall activities

The application includes a statement of purpose, budget, transcript(s), resume, and supporting documentation.
