## Thomas Massaro, S.J.

Father Massaro's goal as the holder of the McGinley Chair is to advance the faithful and creative application of Catholic social thought to the many urgent challenges facing contemporary society, in line with the social justice commitments of the Society of Jesus. His ultimate aim is to continue Fordham's unique contribution to the constructive dialogue between Catholic theology and the vibrant pluralistic community of New York City, as well as the wider national community of the United States.

Following in the tradition of this endowed professorship, he will deliver two lectures each year in the spring and fall. His first McGinley Chair lecture will coincide with his installation ceremony on April 9, 2025.
