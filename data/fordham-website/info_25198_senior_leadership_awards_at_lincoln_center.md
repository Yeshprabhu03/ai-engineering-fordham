**The Awards**

**Senior Leadership Award**

Nominees should have exhibited the ability to lead, organize, empower, and inspire fellow students in our overall efforts to create a welcoming, involved, and inclusive community. Each should possess a high degree of commitment, creativity, innovation, initiative and integrity. As quality leadership is a way of conducting one's self and not merely possession of a title or position, candidates need not have held positions of high visibility.

**Journalism Award**

The Journalism Award will be given to the senior who has made an outstanding contribution to a Fordham LC student publication in the field of publishing, editing, writing or graphic arts.

**St. Alberto Hurtado, SJ Mission, Faith and Justice Award**

This award is given to the senior who has exhibited excellence and leadership in exemplifying Fordham's Jesuit mission by living a life of faith that does justice. This student has dedicated his/her time to others through service and social justice work and has taken on leadership roles to help foster the moral and spiritual growth of the Fordham Community. This student has shown enthusiasm, dedication, and compassion when working with others, especially those who are marginalized, disadvantaged, or underprivileged and encourages others to do the same. This student promotes the causes of social justice and spiritual growth in the larger community and securing positive change in the world.
