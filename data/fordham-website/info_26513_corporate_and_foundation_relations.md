**Office of Institutional Giving**(IG), in the Division of Development and University Relations (DAUR), supports Fordham University in achieving its education and research mission by raising funds from corporations and foundations.

The Office of Institutional Giving works across Fordham's undergraduate colleges, graduate schools, and Law School to assist faculty and program directors in obtaining external support for projects that have been identified as University priorities. Grant funds from corporations and foundations enable research, fund special projects, meet capital needs, support curriculum development, and provide resources for community engagement and a variety of other initiatives.

As an office within Development and University Relations, the Office of Institutional Giving raises money for scholarships and campaign priorities but also works closely with the Office of Sponsored Programs in seeking competitive grants for faculty research and special projects.
