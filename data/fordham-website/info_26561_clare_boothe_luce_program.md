Since its inception in 1989, the Clare Boothe Luce (CBL) Program has been one of the most significant sources of support for women seeking to study or teach science, engineering, and mathematics. Fordham is proud to be a part of this program and to connect our students to its offerings. To learn more about the life and legacy of Clare Boothe Luce, and her dedication to fostering the growth of women in STEM, please see this fascinating [article](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201903/rnoti-p387.pdf).

Women comprise nearly half the faculty in non-science fields at four-year colleges and universities nationwide, but only about a quarter of faculty in mathematics, and an even smaller percentage in the physical sciences, engineering and computer science. To encourage women to enter sciences, mathematics and engineering fields, the CBL Program awards:

Eligible students must be:

- female
- a U.S. citizen or permanent resident
- majoring or pursuing matriculated graduate studies in an approved field (please note that students on the pre-health track are ineligible)
- intending to pursue a career in teaching and research in these fields

All awards are based on undertaking research with a mentor and each awardee must have a mentor by the time the award period begins. Awardees may not switch their major or field of study, or graduate degree program during the term of the award, and are required to report on their progress according to the requirements of their award. Recipients will also be invited to participate in dedicated programming to encourage their professional development and networking.

CBL Timeline:

- February - Eligible students will be invited to apply for a CBL award.
