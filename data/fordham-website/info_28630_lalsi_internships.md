**Pregones/PRTT**(Bronx and New York, NY)

Following years of enterprising activity on stage and in the community, Pregones Theater and Puerto Rican Traveling Theater recently merged into a single Latino arts organization with performance venues in The Bronx and Manhattan. The transformation builds upon congruence of mission, values, and programs, and sustained engagement of a growing network of diverse artists and audiences throughout and beyond New York City. Moving forward, Pregones/PRTT champions a cultural legacy of broad impact through (1) creation and performance of original musical theater and plays rooted in Puerto Rican/Latino cultures and (2) presentation of other artists who share our twin commitment to the arts and civic enrichment.- Phone: 718-585-1202 (Bronx), 212-354-1293 (Manhattan)
