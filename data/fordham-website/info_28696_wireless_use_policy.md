# Wireless Use Policy

## Version 2

**For Students, Faculty, Staff, Guests, Alumni**

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to regulate wireless network access to the University’s IT Resources.

## Scope

This IT policy, and all policies referenced herein, shall apply to all members of the University community, including faculty, students, administrators, staff, alumni, authorized guests, delegates, and independent contractors (the “User(s)” or “you”) who use, access, or otherwise employ, locally or remotely, the University’s IT Resources, whether individually controlled, shared, stand-alone, or networked.

## Policy Statement

- User authentication is required before accessing the 'Fordham' or
[eduroam](https://eduroam.org/about/connect-yourself/)wireless networks.[1](#1) - The FordhamGuest (non-authenticated wireless service) provides visitors with unprotected and insecure access to the Internet for basic web browsing and is limited to Internet-available services.
- Users must not use the network to exchange sensitive or personal information.

- The University monitors the wireless networks for interfering devices to ensure reliable access.
- The University reserves the right to restrict/remove device access to the wireless networks to prevent Users from infecting, degrading, or otherwise negatively impacting IT Resources.
- Users must not install a personal Wireless Access Point or any device that interferes with wireless IT Resources.
- Should any such device be detected, the University notifies the User, and the User is then required to disable and remove the device from the network. If the User does not promptly disable the device, the University reserves the right to disconnect the device from the network.
