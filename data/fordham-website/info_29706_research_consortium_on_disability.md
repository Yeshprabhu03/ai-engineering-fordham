Diego Perez is a college undergrad at Fordham University currently studying neuroscience. His passion in the arts and sciences led him to create a portfolio of pieces titled “Human Abnormalities” that focused on physical abnormalities as features of beauty and artwork. Diego spent the formative years of his art career asking what the purpose of his artwork was, if it was to paint as realistically as possible or to create a message. This led to an emphasis on realism as well as striving to find a statement that engages with the world.

Diego practiced art in high school classes and has taken two art courses at the Honk Kong campus of the Savannah College of Art and Design. One can currently find him in New York, working towards a career in neuroscience while currently seeking outlets for his artwork. Questions on quantum physics, the nature of being, the relationship between art and society, and where to find the best dim sum place in New York rattle his mind on the daily.
