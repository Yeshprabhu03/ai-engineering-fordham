# REAL Scholars Program

## The Mission

Fordham’s Law School’s Realizing Excellence and Access in the Law (REAL) Scholars Program is committed to transforming law school and the legal profession by preparing and expanding opportunities for first year law students who have encountered challenges or obstacles on their path to entering law school.

## The Purpose

The purpose of REAL is to enhance the academic, professional, wellness, and social opportunities for incoming first year J.D. students, particularly those who encountered obstacles or challenges on their path towards a legal career.

The REAL Scholars Program is designed to provide incoming first-year J.D. students with an early orientation to the study of law, fostering a sense of preparedness, confidence, and belonging within the Fordham Law community. Participants will engage in structured programming focused on the development of essential academic, professional, and interpersonal competencies critical to success in law school. In addition, the program offers sustained exposure to institutional resources and a robust support network comprising faculty, alumni, current students, and legal professionals—resources that will remain available throughout their legal education.

The REAL experience commences with a structured Pre-Orientation week consisting of workshops and seminars designed to introduce Scholars to the foundational principles of legal education, including legal reasoning, analysis, and methodology. This initial programming also encompasses sessions focused on the realities of the law school experience, the development of practical lawyering skills, and the cultivation of a sense of community. Throughout the week, Scholars will be introduced to a broad network of support, including faculty, administrators, mentors, current and incoming students, as well as practicing attorneys and other legal professionals—individuals who will serve as ongoing resources throughout their legal education.

## Eligibility

Incoming first year J.D. students admitted to Fordham University School of Law are eligible to apply to the REAL Scholars Program. Upon review, select applicants will be offered admission into the REAL Scholars Program. Admitted students must timely confirm their participation and agree to commit to program requirements.

## Student Testimonials

Shivani Parikh, Fordham Law ’24 Being a part of the REAL summer program was instrumental in feeling like I had a community from the day I stepped into the building on the first day of classes. For first-generation law students of color, it can be isolating and confusing when you are simultaneously navigating a demanding curriculum, a new institution, and your career goals in New York City. Being a public interest student of color also made it challenging for me to always feel a sense of belonging in my affinity group - a double minority. The REAL program throughout the school year (whether the Office of Student Affairs administrators, cohort peers, or allied faculty supporters) always cheered me on, made me feel that I am not alone on my journey, and reminded me that others see & value me as a friend and colleague. It has been especially rewarding as a 2L to give back and return to the program as a mentor to six REAL students in the Class of 2025! |

Rian Morrissey, Fordham Law ’24 The REAL summer program was my first introduction to the law school experience at Fordham. I knew that being a person of color would be a different law school experience than from most of my colleagues. The REAL program provided a network of diverse peers and mentors that significantly contributed to my success and continues to do so throughout my law school experience. This was particularly impactful when I discovered that I was the only African American man in my first year of classes. REAL has become my support system within the school regarding career advancement, academics, and mentorship. As a 2L, I still have a strong connection with both cohorts and provide any resources and look forward to seeing how the program will continue to evolve. |
