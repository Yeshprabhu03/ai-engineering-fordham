# Identity Theft

**Identity Theft Warning and Response**

If you notice changes to your personal online accounts at Fordham or elsewhere that you did not initiate, this could be a sign that your identity has been stolen. Common indicators of identity theft include:

- unusual or unexplainable charges on your bills
- phone calls you did not make, or bills for accounts, products, or services that you did not authorize
- failure to receive regular bills or mail
- new, strange accounts appearing on your credit report
- unexpected denial of your credit card

**What to do if you are a victim of identity theft**

If you suspect identity theft, take immediate action by contacting the relevant offices at Fordham University, including Student Financial Aid, the Bursar's Office, Human Resources, and Enrollment Services. Additionally, notify your bank and credit card companies. It's also important to file a report with your local police department.

Act quickly to minimize any damaging effects to your credit, your reputation, and your peace of mind.
