# Blocking Calendar Phishing in Google Calendar

**For Students, Faculty, Staff, Guests, Alumni**

Calishing is a type of phishing attack that abuses online calendars by sending fake event invitations or automatically added events that look legitimate but are actually malicious. These events may claim to be security alerts, invoices, appointments, or package deliveries and often include links or phone numbers that try to trick you into sharing passwords, financial information, or installing malware. If you see an unexpected calendar event, do not click any links or call any numbers in the event description. Instead, verify the event through a trusted source, delete it from your calendar, and report suspicious activity to Information Security and Assurance.
