# Account Separation and Account Retention Procedure

## Version 2.0

**For Students, Faculty, Staff, Guests, Alumni**

## Purpose

The purpose of this procedure is to protect University business units and constituents against the improper dissemination of or unauthorized access. Fordham University faculty, staff, students, and student organizations are provided with a Fordham username. In some situations, the University must retain control over accounts for continuity of business purposes and to protect Fordham Sensitive Data and Fordham Protected Data

## Scope

This IT security document and all policies referenced herein, shall apply to all members of the University community, including faculty, students, administrative officials, staff, alumni, authorized guests, delegates, and independent contractors (the “User(s)” or “you”) who use, access, or otherwise employ, locally or remotely, the University’s IT Resources, whether individually controlled, shared, stand-alone, or networked.


## Procedure:

Roles determine account privileges. The roles described in this procedure are as follows:

- Administrator
- Faculty
- Student
- Alumni

**Primary vs. Secondary Role-Based Accounts**

- Fordham provides each person with a primary email account for the person’s primary role.
- Individuals with two roles (e.g., employee plus student or alumni) also receive a second role-based email account.
- Use each account only for communications tied to that account’s role.
- University systems that require sign-in must be accessed with the primary account. See “Set up your second role-based account” below.

**Set up your Second Role-Based Account**

- Go to
[claim.fordham.edu/update](http://claim.fordham.edu/update)and sign in with your primary account. - Under “Role Based Account,” select Update Password for the second account.
- In a new window, log in to
[my.fordham.edu](http://my.fordham.edu/)with the second account and complete Duo setup. - Use the second account only for communications tied to that role.

**Upon Separation from the University:**

- Employees (administrators and faculty):
- The employee account is disabled on the last day of employment.
- If the individual is also a student or alumnus, that student’s or alumnus’s account remains active per University policy.

- Students:
- Upon graduation or completion of at least one course, the student/alumni account remains active.

- Individuals with two roles:
- The active role determines the primary account; the other role is maintained as the second account while that role persists.

- Forwarding is optional and at the University’s discretion; the employee account may be configured with a forwarding message for up to 120 days.
- Forwarding may be denied or terminated for risk, policy, or legal hold reasons.
- Forwarding must not be set from the student or alumni account to personal addresses.


**Data Custodianship and Access after Separation **

- Business records in the employee account (i.e., mail, Drive, calendar) are University property.
- Upon manager or department request and with HR approval, Information Security and Assurance can preserve, delegate, or transfer access to business content.
- Personal content is not retained except as required to satisfy legal or regulatory obligations.

**Legal Hold and eDiscovery **

- When legal hold or investigative preservation is in effect, mailbox changes, deletion, and forwarding options are suspended.
- Information Security and Assurance will coordinate with the Office of Legal Counsel.

**Sponsored or Guest Accounts **

- Sponsored and guest accounts are time-bound, must identify a responsible sponsor, and are disabled automatically at the end of the sponsorship unless renewed.
