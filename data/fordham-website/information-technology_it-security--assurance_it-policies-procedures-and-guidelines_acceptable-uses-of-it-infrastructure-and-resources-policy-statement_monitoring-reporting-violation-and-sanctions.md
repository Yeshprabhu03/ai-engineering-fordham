# Monitoring, Reporting, Violation, and Sanctions

## A. Monitoring

The University may, but is not required to, monitor use, deny access, or otherwise prevent inappropriate use of the IT Resources. If violations of this Policy are found, the University may initiate charges and impose appropriate sanctions per the process applicable to the User's status at the University (i.e., student, employee).

## B. Reporting

Users must report violations of this Policy and any potential security or other breaches. Reporting of any such violations or other issues involving the inappropriate use of the IT Resources should be referred to:

- The Dean of Students (or delegate) if the alleged offender is a student on any campus except students in the School of Law;
- The Academic Dean (or delegate) in the School of Law, if the alleged offender is a student therein;
- The appropriate Academic Dean or Provost if the alleged offender is a faculty member;
- The Area Vice President, if the alleged offender is an administrator;
- The Vice President of Human Resources (or delegate), if the alleged offender is any other employee who does not fall into any of the above categories;
- The Vice President for Development and University Relations, if the alleged offender is an alumnus of the University; or
- The Associate Vice President for Information Technology/CISO for all other alleged offenders.

## C. Violations

A violation of this policy is considered a breach of the University's principles, objectives, and standards. Depending on the severity of the conduct, it also may violate the University's other policies or local, state, federal, or international law. The University may impose penalties ranging from terminating the User's access to the IT Resources to disciplinary review and non-reappointment, discharge, or dismissal. In cases involving egregious violations, the University may institute legal action or cooperate with a lawsuit brought by applicable authorities or third parties.

## D. Sanctions

Users who violate this Policy are subject to sanctions imposed by the University.

Sanctions against students are listed in the Fordham University Student Handbook. Additional information is available on [University policies](https://www.fordham.edu/info/21366/policies), [Residential Life policies](/student-life/residence-hall-agreement/), and [academic policies in the Undergraduate Bulletin](https://www.fordham.edu/UndergraduateBulletin/).

The faculty is subject to disciplinary action, including reprimand, suspension, and dismissal, as the [Article IV of the University Statutes](/about/leadership-and-administration/board-of-trustees/university-statutes/article-four-policies-and-procedures-for-faculty/) stipulates.

Administrators and staff are subject to disciplinary action under their respective [handbooks](https://www.fordham.edu/info/27332/handbook_for_administrators) and [collective bargaining agreements.](https://www.fordham.edu/info/26853/human_resources_policies_and_guides/5793/collective_bargaining_agreements)

Depending on the nature and severity of the violation, sanctions can range from various levels of warnings to immediate termination of employment or enrollment.

The University will exercise good faith in its enforcement of this Policy. It will respect the academic freedom to which Users are entitled to the extent the legal rights and obligations of the University allows.

Under no circumstance shall the University be liable to any User or third party for any violation, including illegal or improper acts that any User commits using the IT Resources.
