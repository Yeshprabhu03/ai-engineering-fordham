**RHI data is classified as Fordham Protected Data and requires the highest levels of protection per the Data Classification and Protection Policy. The key distinction between RHI and PHI is that PHI is associated with or derived from a healthcare service event (i.e., the provision of care or payment for care). RHI is provided as part of voluntary participation in a research study. RHI is covered by other state and federal laws for privacy and confidentiality of research health information and human subjects research protections.**
