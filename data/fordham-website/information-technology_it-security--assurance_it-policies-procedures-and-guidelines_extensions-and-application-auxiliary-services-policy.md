# Extensions and Application Auxiliary Services Policy

## Version 1.1

**For Students, Faculty, Staff, Guests, Alumni**

## Purpose

This policy outlines Fordham University’s position on the use of browser extensions, add-ons, plug-ins, and other auxiliary application services that may interact with University-supported platforms. It aims to protect institutional data, uphold contractual obligations, and reduce the risk of unvetted third-party services compromising IT Resources.

## Scope

This IT security policy, and all policies referenced herein, shall apply to all members of the University community, including faculty, students, administrative officials, staff, alumni, authorized guests, delegates, and independent contractors (the “User(s)” or “you”) who use, access, or otherwise employ, locally or remotely, the University’s IT Resources, whether individually controlled, shared, stand-alone, or networked.

## Policy Statement

- Only software applications and auxiliary services that have been provisioned, licensed, or approved by the University, either through formal review or as part of established enterprise agreements, are authorized for use.
- The appearance of a tool within a platform’s interface or marketplace (e.g., Microsoft AppSource, Zoom App Marketplace, Google Workspace Marketplace) does not imply University approval.
- Users must consult Information Security and Assurance before enabling tools that have not been explicitly sanctioned.


- Users must:
- Confirm that a tool is included in the University’s sanctioned software list as defined in the Data Classification Guidelines2 or has been provisioned or reviewed by Information Security and Assurance.
- Not use third-party tools to access, store, or transmit Fordham Protected Data or Fordham Sensitive Data unless explicitly authorized for that purpose.
- Avoid enabling applications that request excessive permissions (e.g., file system access, identity credentials, email content) without formal review.
- Contact Information Security and Assurance if there is any uncertainty about a tool’s approval status or data compatibility.
- The University reserves the right to restrict, disable, or remove access to any auxiliary service or application that poses a risk to institutional security, privacy, compliance, or operational integrity.
- The University disclaims all responsibility and liability for consequences resulting from the use of extensions, plug-ins, or auxiliary services that are not formally approved.
- Users assume all risks, including but not limited to data loss, unauthorized disclosure, service disruption, or regulatory noncompliance.
- Policy violations, especially involving Fordham Protected Data or Fordham Sensitive Data, may result in disciplinary action and do not limit the University’s responsibility to investigate and respond to any resulting data incident.
