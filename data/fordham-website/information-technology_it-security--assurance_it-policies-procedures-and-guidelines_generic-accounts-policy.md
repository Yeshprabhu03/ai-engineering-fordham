# Generic Accounts Policy

## Version 1.1

**For Students, Faculty, Staff, Guests, Alumni**

## Purpose

This policy establishes the acceptable use of Generic Accounts.

## Scope

This IT policy, and all policies referenced herein, shall apply to all members of the University community, including faculty, students, administrators, staff, authorized guests, delegates, and independent contractors (the “User(s)” or “you”) who use, access, or otherwise employ, locally or remotely, the University’s IT Resources, whether individually controlled, shared, stand-alone, or networked.

## Policy Statement

- Generic Account use is prohibited on all non-Public Computers and wherever Information Security and Assurance compensating controls cannot be implemented.
- Generic Account requests may be granted based on justification and appropriate need. Information Security and Assurance must approve exceptions to this policy in advance through the IT Service Desk ticketing system.
- Generic Accounts need to ensure compliance with University policies (i.e., auditing of rights/permissions to appropriate users).
- Information Security and Assurance will audit the usage of Generic Accounts on an annual basis and will work with the owners of found Generic Accounts to limit their use with minimal impact on the business of that department.

## Definitions
