# Internet of Things Policy

## Version 1.5

**For Students, Faculty, Staff, Guests, Alumni**

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the University’s IT Resources by regulating the use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and connecting them to the appropriate University network.

## Scope

This IT security policy, and all policies referenced herein, shall apply to all members of the University community, including faculty, students, administrators, staff, alumni, authorized guests, delegates, and independent contractors (the “User(s)” or “you”) who use, access, or otherwise employ, locally or remotely, the University’s IT Resources, whether individually controlled, shared, stand-alone, or networked.

## Policy Statement

- In support of University functions, the faculty and staff must sumbit an official request to use an IoT device or collection of devices specified in the
[Internet of Things for Faculty/Staff Networks procedure](/information-technology/it-security--assurance/it-policies-procedures-and-guidelines/internet-of-things-procedure-for-facultystaff/). - All other Users must request IoT device connections per the
[Internet of Things for Public Networks](/information-technology/it-security--assurance/it-policies-procedures-and-guidelines/internet-of-things-procedure-for-public-networks/)procedure. - The University has classified the IoT networks into the following groups:
- Administrative/Restricted (i.e., University-owned and managed devices, contracted services),
- Building management systems (e.g., specialized instruments, HVAC, elevators),
- Community devices owned and operated by faculty or staff (e.g., televisions, Apple TV
®, Chromecast™), or - Student-owned devices on the public network.

- Faculty/Staff IoT device requests must be reviewed and connected to the appropriate network as deemed necessary by Information Security and Assurance and DevOps Infrastructure Services.
- IoT devices must only be connected to a segregated and controlled network segment.
- IoT networks must be monitored to identify abnormal traffic and emergent threats.

- IoT devices should have a process for updating software, hardware, and relevant firmware as stated in the
[Vulnerability Management Policy](/information-technology/it-security--assurance/it-policies-procedures-and-guidelines/vulnerability-management-policy/#d.en.90893), as applicable.
