# Patch Management Policy

## Version 1.3

**For Students, Faculty, Staff, Guests, Alumni**

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to enforce patch requirements for University-owned or managed IT Resources.

## Scope

This IT security policy, and all policies referenced herein, shall apply to all members of the University community, including faculty, students, administrative officials, staff, alumni, authorized guests, delegates, and independent contractors (the “User(s)” or “you”) who use, access, or otherwise employ, locally or remotely, the University’s IT Resources, whether individually controlled, shared, stand-alone, or networked.

## Policy Statement

- All IT Resources must be part of a patch management cycle.
- Owners and managers are responsible for the assessment of IT Resources under their management or supervision.
- All patches or configuration changes must be deployed to University-owned or managed IT Resources when a vulnerability is determined per the
[Vulnerability Management Policy](/information-technology/it-security--assurance/it-policies-procedures-and-guidelines/vulnerability-management-policy/).

## Definitions

**IT Resources** include computing, networking, communications, applications, and telecommunications systems, infrastructure, hardware, software, data, databases, personnel, procedures, physical facilities, cloud-based vendors, Software as a Service (SaaS) vendors, and any related materials and services.

**A patch** is a software update comprised of code inserted (i.e., patched) into the code of an executable program. Typically, a patch is installed into an existing software program. Patches are often temporary fixes between full releases of a software package. Patches include, but are not limited to the following:

- Updating software
- Fixing a software bug
- Installing new drivers
- Addressing new security vulnerabilities
