[Acceptable Use of IT Infrastructure and Resources](/information-technology/it-security--assurance/it-policies-procedures-and-guidelines/acceptable-uses-of-it-infrastructure-and-resources-policy-statement/)policy.

[Data in Transit](https://www.fordham.edu/info/28700/data_in_transit_policy),[Data at Rest](https://www.fordham.edu/info/28699/data_at_rest_policy)policies, and[Data Classification Guidelines](https://www.fordham.edu/info/25534/data_classification_guidelines). - Third parties must demonstrate compliance with industry security standards (e.g., SSAE 18, SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001).

## Definitions

**Application Programming Interface (API)** is a set of protocols enabling software communication and integration with third-party applications.

**Central Authentication Service (CAS)** is an authentication protocol allowing authorized users to access multiple applications.

**IT Resources** include computing, networking, communications, application, telecommunications systems, infrastructure, hardware, software, data, databases, personnel, procedures, physical facilities, cloud-based vendors, Software as a Service (SaaS) vendors, and related materials and services.

**Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) **is a session-based authentication standard that enables identity verification between the University and a third-party service.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** is a service that allows users to access multiple applications using a single set of login credentials.

A **Third-Party** is any non-Fordham entity that provides a product or service to the University.
