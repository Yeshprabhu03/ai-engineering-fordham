## About Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the capability of a computer system to mimic human cognitive functions such as learning and problem-solving. This term was coined in 1956.AI can be broken down into two major fields: Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

Machine learning (ML) is the process of using mathematical models of data to help a computer learn without direct instruction. Deep learning involves training artificial neural networks to learn and make predictions from large amounts of data. It utilizes multiple layers of interconnected neurons to automatically extract meaningful patterns and features, enabling the network to progressively understand complex relationships and perform sophisticated tasks.
