Learn how Google’s NotebookLM helps you get more from your research. Unlike other AI, NotebookLM uses your uploaded documents to answer questions, generate study guides, quizzes, and even interactive podcasts. This workshop will show you how to use NotebookLM’s chat function and “studio” features, and explain how its unique design keeps your research secure. Perfect for students and researchers in humanities and research-heavy fields.

Already attended a previous NotebookLM session? This workshop is still worth your time! Google has added many new features over the past year, including a mobile app, video overviews, and automatic slidedeck generation.

**Day-to-Day AI: An Introduction to Generative AI for University Faculty**Are you curious about generative AI? Want an explanation of how it works? An overview of potential real-world uses? Tips on how to spot AI hallucinations and how to avoid them? And be able to speak on the topic a bit more supportively with your students?

Join us for a hands-on, practical workshop where we confront the fact that while generative AI creates compelling content, it doesn’t always create truth. The real benefits will stem from your understanding of its capabilities and limitations.


Together, we will:- Understand the fundamentals of generative AI and how it differs from traditional conceptions of AI
- Explore real-world examples and case studies that highlight both the promise, pitfalls, and ethical questions of this technology
- Access a curated list of the best generative AI tools currently available
- Review “prompt engineering” best practices to get the most relevant, accurate, and useful responses from AI tools.
- Discover practical ways to integrate AI into your workday, including: summarizing documents, classifying and organizing data, generating or completing text, getting coaching, advice, and suggestions, and finding answers.

Event Description

This presentation will draw attention to the particular challenges facing global policy-making efforts in the race to regulate and govern Artificial Intelligence locally and globally. Through a discussion of recent work in AI literacies, ethical design, games, and data as they inform industry and policy, Dr. Chee will engage the audience in some of the multilateral efforts currently underway in regulating our most intimate contexts and spaces. In this discussion, we will go beyond binary thinking and venture into where ethics and privacy implicate data, autonomy in navigating various consent regimes, and what we can learn about respecting human rights in everyday practice.Speaker

Some of you may remember Dr. Bowen as one of the most effective and well-received keynote speakers from our Faculty Technology Day events. He is a winner of the Stamford University Alumni Scholar Award, as well as the Ernest L. Boyer Award in 2018 by the New American Colleges and Universities. He is also currently writing a book on teaching with AI.

About the Session

The excitement (and panic) surrounding A.I. is shattering expectations around assignments, assessment, class preparation and attendance, while challenging us to build more future-proof and inclusive classrooms. AI is changing working and thinking: as jobs and the way humans do thinking tasks change, how will our curriculum respond? AI is also changing how we think about average. If ChatGPT can produce consistent "C" work, then we need to update our policies around grading. AI is even changing creativity. Together, we will examine the skills and content that will matter most in this new age, what policies and practices improve motivation and decrease cheating, and why articulation of ‘quality’ is essential. Focusing on the tangible, attendees will also learn techniques to transform assignments and assessments to motivate and engage students by placing greater emphasis on the process and experience of learning.

Popular programs like

[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/)can solve complex math problems, create original music and art, and write stories better than an actual person—and sound like one, too. This has triggered a big question among educators: How will AI affect assignments, assessments, and originality in the classroom?On Feb. 7, Fordham’s Graduate School of Education hosted a panel discussion at the Lincoln Center campus, “Threat or Opportunity? The Impact of AI on Education,” where five experts explored how AI can impact students at all grade levels—and why sometimes, we learn better without fancy chatbots.
