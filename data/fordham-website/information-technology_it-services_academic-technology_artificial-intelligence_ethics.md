Event Description

This presentation will draw attention to the particular challenges facing global policy-making efforts in the race to regulate and govern Artificial Intelligence locally and globally. Through a discussion of recent work in AI literacies, ethical design, games, and data as they inform industry and policy, Dr. Chee will engage the audience in some of the multilateral efforts currently underway in regulating our most intimate contexts and spaces. In this discussion, we will go beyond binary thinking and venture into where ethics and privacy implicate data, autonomy in navigating various consent regimes, and what we can learn about respecting human rights in everyday practice.Speaker
