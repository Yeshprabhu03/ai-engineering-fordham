**No More Free-Riders! Designing Systems for Meaningful & Fair Team Project Experiences**[January 2026]

Drawing on my transition from a frustrated student to a marketing professor, I propose a systemic approach to eliminate free-riding and restore student motivation in team projects. By balancing Monitoring with Incentive, we can protect responsible high-performers and motivate disengaged students. Attendees will gain practical strategies to architect a fair environment where individual effort is quantified, leadership is rewarded, and collaborative work becomes a professional milestone. I suggest we move beyond grading the final deliverable as a "black box" and instead design a process where fairness is structural and excellence is the intentional result of the system.*Presented by Seoyoung Kim, Marketing Department*[Recording](https://fordham.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=f3510729-7697-45b9-95fe-b3d20151531b)[24:41]
