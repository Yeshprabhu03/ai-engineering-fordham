### Keynote

Teaching and Thinking with A.I.

Co-presented by [José Antonio Bowen, Ph.D. ](https://josebowen.com/)and [C. Edward Watson, Ph.D.](https://www.eddiewatson.net/), the authors of the upcoming book, [Teaching with AI: A Practical Guide to a New Era of Human Learning. ](https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/54122/teaching-ai)

The excitement (and panic) surrounding A.I. is shattering expectations around assignments, assessment, class preparation and attendance, while challenging us to build more future-proof and inclusive classrooms. AI is rapidly changing how humans work and think. AI is also changing how we think about average and AI is even changing creativity. This session will give you a different way to think about AI and introduce the workshops to come.
