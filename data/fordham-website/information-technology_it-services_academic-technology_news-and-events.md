In this webinar, Dr. Amin and his mentee, Innocent Ababio, reviewed and leveraged their experience developing their own large language model and instructed participants on current best practices for collecting quality datasets, choosing appropriate model architectures, training and fine-tuning parameters, evaluating output, and monitoring for issues like toxicity.

This webinar gave faculty firsthand experience building a small LLM while covering theoretical topics like self-supervision and transfer learning. Participants gained practical skills to apply in their own NLP and AI projects in academia.

**Faculty Technology Bootcamp:**a week of workshops aimed at helping faculty leverage technology to enhance teaching, research, and student engagement by providing you with immediately applicable strategies to save time, boost productivity, and energize your classes. -
Some of you may remember Dr. Bowen as one of the most effective and well-received keynote speakers from our Faculty Technology Day events. He is a winner of the Stamford University Alumni Scholar Award, as well as the Ernest L. Boyer Award in 2018 by the New American Colleges and Universities. He is also currently writing a book on teaching with AI.

About the Session

The excitement (and panic) surrounding A.I. is shattering expectations around assignments, assessment, class preparation and attendance, while challenging us to build more future-proof and inclusive classrooms. AI is changing working and thinking: as jobs and the way humans do thinking tasks change, how will our curriculum respond? AI is also changing how we think about average. If ChatGPT can produce consistent "C" work, then we need to update our policies around grading. AI is even changing creativity. Together, we will examine the skills and content that will matter most in this new age, what policies and practices improve motivation and decrease cheating, and why articulation of ‘quality’ is essential. Focusing on the tangible, attendees will also learn techniques to transform assignments and assessments to motivate and engage students by placing greater emphasis on the process and experience of learning.

Popular programs like

[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/)can solve complex math problems, create original music and art, and write stories better than an actual person—and sound like one, too. This has triggered a big question among educators: How will AI affect assignments, assessments, and originality in the classroom?On Feb. 7, Fordham’s Graduate School of Education hosted a panel discussion at the Lincoln Center campus, “Threat or Opportunity? The Impact of AI on Education,” where five experts explored how AI can impact students at all grade levels—and why sometimes, we learn better without fancy chatbots.
