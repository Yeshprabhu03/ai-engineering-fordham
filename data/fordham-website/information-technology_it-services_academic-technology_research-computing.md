# Research Computing

**For Faculty, Staff**

## Overview

Faculty use Research Computing services to conduct research and experiment with innovative technology projects. It is a virtual service space for faculty who can administer their projects independently, with background IT support available.


## New High Performance Computing (HPC) Magis Cluster

Faculty and student researchers requiring significant computational power can now use the Magis Cluster, Fordham’s new high-performance computing system (HPC). Magis is a 56 Teraflops cluster that has separate Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) equipped with 64,000 CUDA cores, meaning it can handle multiple computationally intensive tasks in parallel at a high speed. We will soon be adding Grace-Hopper GPUs to further enhance Magis's capabilities. Please [email the Research Computing department](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d0b1b1beb7b5bcbfa0bfa5bcbfa390b6bfa2b4b8b1bdfeb5b4a5) for information and the [Office of Research](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/research/office-of-research/contact-us/) to request access.
