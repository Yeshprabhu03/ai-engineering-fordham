**For Students, Faculty, Staff**

## Overview

Eduroam (**edu**cation **roam**ing) is an encrypted, worldwide roaming access service developed for the international research and education community. Fordham University is proud to be a member and provide eduroam service.

Eduroam allows Fordham University students, faculty, and staff to connect to the Internet at participating institutions in the [United States](https://www.incommon.org/eduroam/eduroam-u-s-locator-map/) and [abroad](https://www.eduroam.org/where/). Equally, visitors from participating institutions in the eduroam network can connect to the eduroam wireless network on any of Fordham’s campuses.

## How to connect

Fordham members should run the [SecureW2 JoinNow configuration wizard](https://cloud.securew2.com/public/36185/eduroamPROD/) to set up the device(s) that will be used to connect to the eduroam wireless network. This allows you to use your Fordham credentials to access eduroam at participating institutions. *If you've already run the wizard and are having trouble connecting to eduroam, try downloading the wizard and re-enrolling again.*

Although you can run the configuration wizard from anywhere you have an active internet connection, it is highly recommended that you configure your device for eduroam while on the Fordham University campus before you leave.

For assistance connecting to the eduroam service, Fordham University students, faculty, and staff can contact the [IT Service Desk](/information-technology/it-services/technology-support/). Visitors from participating eduroam organizations should contact their home institution’s help desk.
