# Laptop First

**For Faculty, Staff**

## Overview

(effective from July 1, 2022)

Laptop First program is designed to address the shift in how we work after the pandemic. This program offers employees a standard Fordham laptop, listed below, along with a comprehensive setup to mirror the same experience and power of a desktop that we used to have. The setup includes a laptop, docking station, 24” monitor, keyboard, and mouse. This setup ensures flexibility and mobility, allowing employees to transition between office and remote work environments seamlessly. This also protects the university's data. You can think of the laptop with the large monitor and docking station very similar to the desktop in power, functionality and experience. In instances where an employee needs a desktop, they can have one instead of a laptop. For a non-standard Fordham laptop, a special request is necessary. This special request should include a business rationale explaining why a standard Fordham laptop will not meet the business needs, along with their manager's approval. Despite the emphasis on laptops, "Laptop First" prioritizes meeting the diverse needs of employees to optimize their productivity and comfort in the workplace, whether it might be in the office or at home.

## Replacements

We understand the importance of having reliable technology to support your work. To ensure uninterrupted productivity, we've implemented a policy that computers will be replaced if they are no longer operational (for example, the computer is extremely slow, the system has reached its end of life, and no patches are provided, newer OSs cannot run on the hardware, etc.). If you encounter any issues with your computer affecting its functionality or performance, please promptly notify the IT Service Desk. The team will assess the situation and provide a replacement device as needed, allowing you to continue your work efficiently. Your satisfaction and productivity are our priorities, and we're committed to providing you with the necessary tools to excel in your role.

Coming out of the pandemic and the shift in how and where we work has made us rethink what it means to have a “computer.” We need access to our software and data wherever we work. This required us to move to the Laptop First model and one device to support a user wherever they want to work by keeping their and the university’s data accessible and secure. This led to only **one device per person**. By having just one assigned device, such as a laptop or desktop computer, users can enjoy streamlined operations and enhanced security measures. One device per person helps streamline operations, bolsters security and reduces costs, ultimately benefiting both users and Fordham. This promotes productivity and workflow continuity. With only one device to manage, a user can focus on maximizing its functionality without the added complexity of juggling multiple devices.

Consolidating all work-related activities onto a single device strengthens security protocols. The IT department can implement robust security measures, such as encryption and access controls, more effectively, safeguarding sensitive data and mitigating the risk of breaches. Having a single, dedicated device simplifies the user experience, allowing users to seamlessly access all necessary tools and applications without the hassle of switching between devices. In addition, this helps IT support teams provide you and the devices with the best support. It also minimizes maintenance costs. In instances where an employee requires more than one device, a special request is needed. This special request should include a business rationale explaining why one device doesn't meet the business needs, along with the employee's manager and area VP/Dean's approval. In some cases, there will be further approval required from the CIO’s office.
