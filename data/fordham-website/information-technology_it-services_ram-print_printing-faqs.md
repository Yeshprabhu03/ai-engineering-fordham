# Printing FAQs

Print Anywhere. When working within the Fordham network, you will be able to print from your laptop, desktop, tablet, or smart phone to any of our Canon MFDs in a Fordham facility. With only a single print queue, you won’t have to choose specific MFDs each time you print.

Release Anywhere. You can access your personal print queue on any Canon MFD.

Secure Print Release. Your prints are held securely in your own print queue which you can access on the web or when you badge-in with Fordham ID at any Canon MFD and only release the jobs that you want to print. This keeps your print jobs secure and reduces waste.

Decrease Costs and Environmental Footprint. If you send multiple versions of a document to an MFD, you can delete any versions you don’t want before printing--saving paper, toner, and energy.

Single User Interface. No matter where you are in Fordham, you will experience the same printing interface when using Canon MFDs.

Fordham and Canon professionals are responsible for assessing each environment and location across campus. Device size, type, speed, features, and location are based on standard criteria that include business requirements, average pages printed per month, and related industry standard metrics. This ensures that the appropriate device, device features, and related configuration items will meet individual departmental needs.

-
The Ram Print program includes shared multifunction devices. Some departments require special-purpose scanners or specialty printing devices such as plotters, check printers, hand-held printers, or other devices requiring non-standard supplies and servicing. These specialty printers are not included in the Ram Print program, but Departments should consult with Ram Print before purchasing these types of devices.

Superuser Training will be provided when your department transitions to Ram Print. Additional guides and training materials are available on

To retrieve your print jobs or to copy, scan or fax at a RAM Print device: Place your Fordham ID card over the card reader, or enter your ID and password on the screen.

Primarily to ensure the security of your prints. Using your ID badge or Fordham ID and password to print the document ensures that your printout can only be retrieved by you. A document will not print until you log in at the device. You do not need to rush to a printer to pick up a sensitive document after you send it to print.

It also provides greater convenience. You can send a print to your print queue and access it at any Fordham MFD. It only takes a moment to swipe your badge at the device. If you forget your badge, you can still print by logging in with your mobile key (insert hyper) or network credentials at the device.

When you use a Mac computer or a PC that is not Fordham domain-joined, you see an additional pop-up login screen at the beginning of each session. This pop-up appears after you log out of or restart your computer.

If you have a PC, you can have the computer joined to the Fordham domain. Consult your desktop support team to determine whether this is an option. Although there is no workaround for the Mac computer, our team is currently investigating a permanent solution to this issue.
