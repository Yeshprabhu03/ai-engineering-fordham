# Ramcell Phone Services

**For Faculty, Staff**

## Overview

Ramcell provides mobile service discounts for Fordham employees (not student workers).

## Features

Each mobile carrier sets their own policies for eligibility and requirements for discounted services. The discount and contact information for each provider is shared by the University, however your service provider must be contacted directly to answer any specific questions you have about the plans.

### T-Mobile Discounts

From this site, you can check available discounts, as well as speak to the carrier about obtaining a discount on a new or existing account.

### Verizon Discounts

Please visit [Verizon's dedicated website for corporate-level discounts](https://www.verizonwireless.com/discount-program/). You will be asked to log in with your existing account and then prompted to verify your employment status via email or pay stub.
