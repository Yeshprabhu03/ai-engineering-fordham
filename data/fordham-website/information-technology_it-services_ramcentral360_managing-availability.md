It is recommended to keep email notifications on, at least initially. To do this, make sure all three items listed under “Email Notification Settings” are toggled to the right, setting them to “Enabled”. **Note:** these notifications will be sent to you regardless of who is making the appointment. This means that if you schedule an appointment on behalf of a student or they schedule an appointment with you in the Student Success Hub you will receive a notification if enabled.

*Please remember to keep your availability up to date. You may need to check on it every few months.

## SSH Appointment Manager Calendar View

When you have appointments scheduled, or to view your availability for a certain day, you can open the SSH Appointment Manager from the utility bar at the bottom-left of your screen, next to the lightning bolt icon. You will see your scheduled time on the left and any scheduled appointments on the right.

## Editing and Deleting Recurring Availability

You may edit your appointment availability from within the Student Success Hub. If you need to edit the start/end times or delete the times of one of your daily recurring appointments, use the Appointment Manager in the lower-left corner of your screen next to the lightning bolt icon to open the calendar view. From there, navigate to the correct day. Find the scheduled appointment block and select the downward pointing arrow to the right of the available time. Then select either **Delete Availability** or **Edit Availability**.
