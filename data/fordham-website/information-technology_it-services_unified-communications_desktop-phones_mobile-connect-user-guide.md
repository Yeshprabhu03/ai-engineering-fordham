# Mobile Connect User Guide

**For Faculty, Staff**

## Overview

Mobile Connect allows you to use your mobile phone to handle calls that are associated with your desk phone number.

## Getting started

To use Cisco Mobile Connect, you must add the mobile and other phones that you want to use to make and receive calls using the same directory numbers as your desk phone. These phones are called remote destinations. You can also define access lists to restrict or allow calls from certain numbers to be sent to your mobile phone.

When you enable Mobile Connect:

-
Your desk phone and remote destinations (your mobile phones) receive calls simultaneously.

-
When you answer the call on your desk phone, the remote destinations stop ringing, are disconnected, and display a missed call message.

-
When you answer the call on one remote destination, the other remote destinations and desk phone stop ringing and are disconnected, and a missed call message is shown on the other remote destinations.

-
When you answer the call on one remote destination and then switch the call to a Cisco Unified device that shares lines, the Cisco Unified devices that share the same line display a “Remote In Use” message.
