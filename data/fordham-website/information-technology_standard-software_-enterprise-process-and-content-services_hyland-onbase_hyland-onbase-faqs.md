Request access via fordham.edu > My Pages > Tech Help or contact the

[IT Service Desk](/information-technology/it-services/technology-support/)at (718) 817-3999 or[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#82eae7eef2ebf6c2e4edf0e6eae3eface7e6f7)and describe your requirements for Imaging or Workflow. -
Imaging, the scanning and indexing, and storage of the documents involved in your work may not cost anything if there is a scanner or multi-function copier available, and the volume of documents is small. As the volume increases, the cost may increase if a scanner needs to be purchased, or a license for Disconnected Scanning to do 30-50 or more documents as a batch.

Workflow solutions can be developed by Fordham resources and we encourage business units to look into empowering their staff to develop web forms and workflows. If you are interested in a workflow solution and will like assistance from IT, please submit a request at fordham.edu > My Pages > Tech Help.

-
In general, document imaging refers to the process of generating digital, electronic documents from hard copy. Documents can be of any type or in any format, such as vouchers, journals, invoices, admissions applications or purchase orders. If documents are indexed, any system or person with appropriate permissions may retrieve them online.

-
There are four primary parts to imaging at Fordham - scanning, uploading, indexing, and retrieving documents.

**Scanning**- this is taking a physical piece of paper and running it through a scanner.**Uploading**- this refers to the sending or uploading of data from a local system to the hosted document repository, which means it's not on the Fordham network.**Indexing**- this is the process of assigning "keys" to the document. It gives the system a piece of information specific to that document so it can be retrieved, and the ability to link other documents using the same piece of information. For example, a great deal of information at Fordham is linked to the student's ID, or FIDN, so we can say that a great deal of information is indexed on FIDN.**Retrieving**- once a document has been stored, you need to be able to get it back and view it. Retrieving a document is done by searching with one or more of the index keys.

-
All types of documents can be scanned.

-
Document scanning is the procedure of using software and scanners to transfer any image or text on paper to a digital picture. The image can then be indexed and stored in a document storage system and is available as a single copy to many people and systems.

-
This is a software module in OnBase normally used for two conditions: for bulk scanning to scan large volumes of documents, and when the scanner in use is not directly connected to the database repository from which the documents will be retrieved.

At Fordham, we have a hosted environment and the repository is disconnected from the network. Once scanned, an internet connection is used to upload the document batches.

-
Right-click the selected batch(es) in the Disconnected Scanning application and select "Upload Batch".


## Workflow

-
Workflow is a module in OnBase which manages automation solutions. A workflow solution can be initiated by the submission of a web form or by the import of a specific document. Workflow solutions are configurable solutions meeting specific requirements. The functionality enables business process automation and has been proven to yield return on investment.
