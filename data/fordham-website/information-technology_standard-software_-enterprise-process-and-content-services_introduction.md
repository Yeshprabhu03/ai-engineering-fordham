# Introduction to Enterprise Process and Content Services

**For Faculty, Staff**

- Do You Have Too Much Paper?
- Are You Losing Track of Documents?
- Employees Engaged in Low-Value Tasks?
- Do You Have Too Many Versions of Critical Documents?
- Compliance Keeping You Up at Night?

OnBase is a document management system with a number of different modules; it is “A system of record for managing process-related documents.” OnBase provides the ability to:

- Capture documents, including paper, email, system reports, e-forms, etc.
- Manage content according to business rules
- Store, organize and track your content
- Deliver documents to processes as soon as they’re needed
- Preserve and protect documents in compliance with internal and external standards

**ONBASE DOCUMENT IMAGING**

OnBase Document Imaging enables paper documents to be systematically captured and stored in standard electronic formats. By converting paper documents to images, OnBase reduces physical storage costs, enables documents to be securely utilized and shared, and results in faster retrieval of business information. Documents can be scanned with any industry standard scanner, individually or in large batches, indexed, and archived into OnBase, taking advantage of several methods for automation.

There are four primary parts to imaging – scanning, uploading, indexing, and retrieving documents.

- Scanning – this is taking a physical piece of paper and running it through a scanner.
- Uploading – this refers to the sending of data from a local system to a repository not on the same network.
- Indexing – this is the process of assigning “keys” to the document. It gives the system a piece of information specific to that document so it can be retrieved, and the ability to link other documents using the same piece of information. For example, a great deal of information at Fordham is linked to the student’s ID, or F I D N, so we can say that a great deal of information is indexed on F I D N.
- Retrieving – once a document has been stored in the system, you need to be able to get it back and view it. Retrieving a document is done by searching one or more of the index keys.

OnBase Document Imaging benefits any institution that needs to electronically store, retrieve, and secure paper documents.

**ONBASE WORKFLOW **

OnBase Workflow is an electronic document routing system that enables users to process work more efficiently, faster and more accurately than with traditional paper processing. An institution’s ability to manage its business processes and adapt quickly can determine its success in higher education. OnBase Workflow streamlines collaboration and business processes; and accelerates the completion of critical business tasks for a wide range of applications.

The OnBase Workflow module uses a configurable set of rules and actions to route documents through a user defined business process. The point and click configuration of OnBase Workflow enables organizations to quickly deploy robust workflow solutions, streamline business processes and create the opportunity for continuous improvements. Documents enter workflow in a variety of ways: electronic forms filled out on the Internet; document imaging; receipt of an email or fax; or manual imports.

The OnBase Workflow rules and actions ensure that documents are distributed in a standard and controlled manner ensuring that business rules and practices are followed. OnBase Workflow can prompt users for input or automatically process documents based on information such as a keyword, the type of document, when the document arrived, the presence of a supporting document, or information from a line of business system.

**ONBASE DISCONNECTED SCANNING**

The OnBase Disconnected Scanning module is a full-featured, standalone scanning application that allows users to scan documents without being connected to the document repository. Paper documents may be scanned and converted to digital images on the scanning workstation using a standard scanner. Scanned batches are uploaded to an OnBase database through a connection to the OnBase Web Server. The upload can be performed manually or scheduled for non-peak hours. Once in the OnBase database, OnBase Client retrieval stations may access the documents.

A big advantage of Disconnected Scanning is the ability to process large volumes of documents, whether a stack of 100 documents, or 100 documents every hour.

- Enables distributed capture at any location with Internet access
- Provides faster capture of time-sensitive documents
- Automates document classification and indexing

**ONBASE VIRTUAL PRINT DRIVER**

The OnBase Virtual Print Driver VPD provides a mechanism to output TIFF images from practically any Windows-based application with print capability. The VPD module enables users to import any document, report or other content that is printable from a Windows application into OnBase as a TIFF image. Once installed, the VPD acts as a standard print driver accessible from any Windows application that offers a print option. Microsoft Office documents, web pages, screen dumps, reports, hosted sessions and so on can all be imported via the VPD by simply "Printing" them into OnBase. Once the VPD is installed as a Windows print driver on a user's workstation, subsequent printing of documents to the VPD automatically invokes the following two-step process. First, the VPD renders the document into a multi-page TIFF image and copies that TIFF rendition to a user-specified spool directory. Next, Web Client users manually invoke the "upload" feature of that client to import the TIFF rendition of the document from the spool directory. Completing the document import dialog and clicking the "import" button concludes the process.
