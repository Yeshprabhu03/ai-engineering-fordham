# Additional Resources for Events

**For Staff**

**Can I request to have a room set up in a particular way, such as a Banquet layout?**

Yes. A small group of spaces allow for multiple layouts of furniture depending on the event type. After selecting the space for your event in the 25Live Event Form, you will be presented with a list of available layouts for that space. It is at that time that you can select the setup you require.

**Who do I contact if I need any audio/visual equipment?**

Enter resources needed on the 25Live Event Form or contact [Media Services](/information-technology/it-services/learning-spaces-and-events-management/) for any academic space, and reference the resource training document for any non-academic space.

**I would like to serve food at my event, what are the policies around catering?**

All food and beverage services are coordinated by the University Caterer - Aramark. Please refer to the [Catering section of their website](https://fordham.campusdish.com/Catering.aspx).
