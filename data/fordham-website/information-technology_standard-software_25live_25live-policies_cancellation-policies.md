# 25Live Cancellation Policies

**For Staff**

**Can I cancel a confirmed reservation and if so, how do I cancel it?**

If you would like to cancel your event, you may do so by contacting the person from whom you received the confirmation email. You must request the cancellation in writing by sending an email to the reservation coordinator of the space.

**What is the minimum amount of time required if I need to cancel a reservation?**

You must notify the reservation coordinator as soon as possible about the cancellation but no later than 72 hours prior to the event. Please refer to your contract for any penalties associated with cancellation of events.

**Can my confirmed reservation be cancelled by the Reservation Coordinator?**

In extraordinary circumstances, the reservation coordinator has the right to change/cancel any reservations as needed.

**Can I allow my colleague to use a room that I have already reserved?**

No, event reservations are not transferable. All confirmed events must be conducted in the manner stipulated in the confirmation. No changes or additions can be made unless confirmed in writing by the reservation coordinator.

**I misspelled the title of my event, can I correct my mistake online?**

No. You must contact the reservation coordinator of the space who will help you correct it.

**What should I do if there is someone else occupying the space I have reserved?**

It is recommended that you carry a copy of your confirmation with you to present it to the group occupying the room. If the party occupying the room refuses to leave the space, you may contact the [Department of Public Safety](/student-life/safety-health-and-wellness/public-safety/) at your campus for resolution of the conflict.
