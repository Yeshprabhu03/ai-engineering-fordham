## Classrooms for Academic Courses

Classrooms for Academic Courses should NOT be submitted through 25Live. While instructors will find 25Live to be helpful in identifying the features and availability of classrooms, the request for a classroom cannot be submitted through 25Live. All requests for academic courses should be submitted through previously set procedures by the department or school. All room assignments are processed in Banner, which then feeds to 25Live through an interface. Instructors can use 25Live to request a make-up session, or special lecture outside of the normal meeting time for the course.

## Denied Events

"Why was my event denied when the classroom requested appears to be available?"

Academic courses may not appear in 25Live until a few weeks before the semester begins, and even then there may be multiple room changes that will have to be made to accommodate all course needs. The Office of Academic Records and the Law School Registrar may not be able to confirm an event until all academic course room assignments are finalized.

### Planning Your Future Event

25Live will only allow users to submit requests up to 2 years in the future. If you request an event beyond that time frame, your request may be Denied or you will be told it will remain in a Pending state until it can be processed.

## Canceling or Editing Your Event

Requestors will not be able to edit an event after it is saved. If you would like to cancel or make changes to an event after it is saved, you can respond to the confirmation email to make the appropriate changes.

Space can only be used for the purpose in which it was originally requested and approved for use. Requestors cannot change the type of event for which the space was requested. Requestors cannot give away an approved allocated time in a room to another group. Any changes to an event type or room use needs to be sent to the person who sends the confirmation email.

## Processing Your Requests

"How can I tell if my request has been processed?"

All Schedulers will send an email for each request to notify the requestor if it was approved or denied. You can also check your Tasks Tab, and click on one of the Assigned By You: options.

### Required Sponsors

"Why am I being asked for the name of a sponsoring Vice President?"

A Vice President, Dean, or Director’s signature is required for use of some spaces, such as:

**Lincoln Center** – 12th Floor Lounge, Plaza View Room, President’s Dining Room, Pope Auditorium

**Rose Hill**– Walsh Library O’Hare Special Collections Room, Walsh Library Outdoor Terrace


Please indicate the name of the Sponsoring VP, Dean, Director, etc… in the Additional Event Information area so the scheduler can follow up with necessary paperwork.

## Pending Event Conflict and Blackout Conflict

"My Event Request won’t save because of a Pending Event Conflict or because of a Blackout Conflict."

**Pending Event Conflict** – Another Event Request is already in progress asking for the same room at the same time. However, it can also be caused by an Event Request that was started and not saved or cancelled. If you encounter this message, please email [[email protected].](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7143443d1807142e371414151310121a31171e031519101c5f1415045f) A 25Live Administrator can remove the Pending reservation.

**Blackout Conflict **- A location Blackout Conflict is different than a Pending Event Conflict. A select few schedulers have the authority to put a blackout on a space if they are holding it for a special event. For example, there might be a Blackout to hold a lecture hall for New Student Orientation or a Board of Trustee meeting. Once the exact times of each meeting and session is confirmed, the Blackout comes off and the actual reservation is then processed. A Blackout could be a real conflict to any new event being submitted.
