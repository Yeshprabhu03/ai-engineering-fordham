After graduation, alumni can continue to access their student Fordham Gmail for life. Note that some Google Workspace services like Google Drive will be removed a few months after graduation.

Members of the Fordham community who are both employees and students or alumni receive two email accounts: one for work and one for student or alumni activities.
