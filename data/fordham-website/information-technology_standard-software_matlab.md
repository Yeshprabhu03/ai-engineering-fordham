# Matlab

**For Students, Faculty, Staff**

## Overview

[MATLAB (matrix laboratory)](https://www.mathworks.com/) is a high-performance language for technical computing, including data analysis, exploration, and visualization. Can be integrated with Simulink, a graphical programming environment.

## Getting started

- Go to
[https://www.mathworks.com/academia/tah-portal/fordham-university-40795824.html](https://www.mathworks.com/academia/tah-portal/fordham-university-40795824.html) - Login with you MathWorks account. If you do not have an account, click "Create Account" and follow the prompts. Be sure to use your Fordham email address
- Once logged in, you'll be directed to a License Center page where you can click "Download Installer" to download and install Matlab

## Features

Everyone has access to MATLAB’s cloud-based tools for instruction.

Access the above via the [MathWorks/Fordham portal](https://www.mathworks.com/academia/tah-portal/fordham-university-40795824.html)

**Simulink **is a graphical programming environment for modeling, simulating and analyzing multidomain dynamical systems. Its primary interface is a graphical block diagramming tool and a customizable set of block libraries. It offers tight integration with the rest of the MATLAB environment and can either drive MATLAB or be scripted from it.
