# Plagiarism Prevention/Academic Integrity

**For Students, Faculty**

## Overview

Blackboard allows instructors to insert plagiarism detection software directly into assignments given to students. By designing assignments with plagiarism detection built-in, students are often deterred from purchasing papers or copying unattributed material into their submissions. Our experience has been that creative assignments that are centered around students’ unique perspective, analysis, and critical thinking, encourage original (and properly attributed) student submissions.

## SafeAssign

A Blackboard-owned plugin that is available whenever a new Blackboard assignment is created. SafeAssign identifies whether a paper contains a high percentage of unoriginal material. It also helps identify the original source material. [Learn about creating SafeAssign assignments](https://help.blackboard.com/SafeAssign/Instructor/In_Your_Course#ultra_use_safeassign).
