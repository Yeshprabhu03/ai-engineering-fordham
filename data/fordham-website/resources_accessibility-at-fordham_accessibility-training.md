**Accessibility Grant Supports Inclusive Education at Fordham**

The New York State Education Department (NYSED) awarded Fordham a grant through the new “Enhancing Supports and Services for Students with Disabilities for Postsecondary Success (SWDPS)” program.

These grants will enable Fordham University to provide a series of accessibility workshops for faculty, students, and staff, strengthening the University’s commitment to inclusion and equal access.

Fordham has partnered with two distinguished experts to lead these workshops. Dr. Auriel Watson, is an authority in educational leadership, and Barbara Kestenbaum, is a special education expert and long-time advocate for individuals with disabilities, with more than 40 years of experience in the field.

The Office of Human Resources Management and the Accessibility Committee would like to extend their sincere gratitude to the Office of Government Relations and Urban Affairs for its invaluable support in securing this grant.
