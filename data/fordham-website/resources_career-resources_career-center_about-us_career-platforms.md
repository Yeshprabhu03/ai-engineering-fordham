PathwayU is an online platform to guide students to purpose when making critical choices about education, career, and employment. Patented predictive analytics have shown students who complete PathwayU have higher GPAs, are more likely to persist in their academic and career programs, are better able to communicate their career goals, are less stressed about identifying their career options, and have more confidence in their ability to make career decisions.

PathwayU evaluates interests, values, personality, and workplace preferences in four different assessments. This information helps students learn about their preferred environments, communication with others, and other important factors when considering various career paths. All four of the assessments take 20-25 minutes to complete in total, which makes it easy for students to complete for personal career exploration or as a part of classroom assignments. In addition, this resource is free for all students, faculty, alumni, and staff!

Once students complete the assessments, PathwayU provides detailed and customized explanations of results, as well as guidance on how to use this information to explore careers and educational pathways. PathwayU uses information from O*NET to provide career and occupational information to students based on their assessment results. These occupations are then connected to our academic programs to provide students with the foundational knowledge needed to consider pursuing that career.
