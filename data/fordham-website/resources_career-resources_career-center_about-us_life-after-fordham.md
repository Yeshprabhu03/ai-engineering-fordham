# Life After Graduating Fordham

## Fordham's Senior Career Survey

The Senior Career Survey is an integral part of telling the Fordham story. Each year, the University makes a survey available to the graduating senior class to gain insight into where graduates go after Fordham. From this information, we answer questions like: Where are graduates working? Are they attending grad school? Are they doing a year of service? How many graduates stay in New York?

The survey results help Fordham identify areas of accomplishment and growth for resources and services, including partnerships with a variety of organizations. In return, graduating students who have completed the survey gain access to exclusive career services, including a dedicated career counselor and a curated database of post-graduation opportunities and resources.

## Frequently asked questions
