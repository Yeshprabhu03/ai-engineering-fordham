# Rams Helping Rams with the Career Center

Rams Helping Rams is an informal mentorship program designed for graduating seniors preparing to enter the workforce. This program centers around developing the core career readiness competencies, as outlined by NACE:

- Career & Self-Development
- Communication
- Critical Thinking
- Equity & Inclusion
- Leadership
- Professionalism
- Teamwork
- Technology

Unlike traditional mentorship programs, there is no formal pairing between students and mentors. Upon acceptance into the program, participants also become eligible for additional coaching that goes beyond standard counseling sessions. Rams Helping Rams kicks off every January with its signature speed networking event.
