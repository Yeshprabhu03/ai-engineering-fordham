# Career Center Info for Current Students

Whether you’ve just started at Fordham or you’re preparing for graduation, the Career Center is here to support you in your professional journey!

We offer programs that will allow you to get involved in a variety of ways. You can stop by one of our workshops, attend a career fair, represent the Career Center as a Career Ambassador, or just come in for a one-on-one counseling appointment. In addition to our in-person offerings at our Rose Hill and Lincoln Center campuses, we have resources and services available virtually via Handshake.
