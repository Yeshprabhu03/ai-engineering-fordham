### About the Humanities Student Ambassadors

The Humanities Student Ambassadors (HSAs) are a dynamic group of students who are looking to bridge the gap between professional development opportunities and Fordham's humanities community. HSAs rely on their passion for the humanities and their curiosity about career readiness to steer students toward career exploration and success.

While Fordham Career Ambassadors (FCAs) may be from any academic background, the HSA program is specifically tailored to the needs of humanities students and related disciplines.
