## Tabling and information sessions

Both tabling events and information sessions help to build brand awareness on-campus with students. Tabling sessions are conducted in high-traffic areas like student lounges and generate direct conversations with students, while information sessions are in a more formal setting, such as a presentation or networking and Q&A event, where your organization can inform students about company programs, opportunities, and workplace culture.

-
There are no cost or fees for hosting a tabling event or an information session.

-
Employers can request a tabling event at least 1-2 weeks in advance and/or information sessions at least 3-4 weeks in advance on Handshake. To request an event, please follow the steps outlined here:

Once you create the event, please email Brittany Perez, Employer Relations Specialist | Equity & Inclusion, for further instructions.

-
Tabling events are held in-person at the Rose Hill Campus or at the Lincoln Center Campus. Information sessions can be in-person at Rose Hill Campus or Lincoln Center Campus, virtual, or hybrid.

-
For both types of events, employers may bring printed informational materials like pamphlets or flyers, promotional products, food, and related items.


-
Tabling events are typically held for two to three hours. Information sessions are usually 30 minutes to one hour in length.

## Coffee chats and interview days

-
Coffee chat sessions, also known as informational interviews, are one-on-one informal conversations between students and a company recruiter or representative, often a Fordham alum. These sessions are typically 15 to 20 minutes long and hosted over the course of a two to three-hour period. Employers use coffee chats to identify candidates that they would like to invite to formal Interview Days.

Coffee chats and interview days follow nearly identical structures but have differing purposes. Opportunities attached to the On-Campus Recruiting Program (OCR) program receive a special label in Handshake that students can view and search within.

-
Interview days give employers the opportunity to host interviews on campus, often resulting in a higher number of applicants. Interviews are typically 30 to 60 minutes long and held over a two to four-hour period.

Interview days and coffee chats follow nearly identical structures but have differing purposes. Opportunities attached to the On-Campus Recruiting Program (OCR) program receive a special label in Handshake that students can view and search within.

-
Coffee chat sessions are informal in nature and will only result in identifying candidates to interview later. Interview days are formal sessions in which students have applied to a position and the results could culminate in an employment offer. If an employer intends to do both sessions, the coffee chat would come before the interview day.

-
At this time, employers do not incur any fees for hosting coffee chats or interview days.

-
On average, employers who list OCR sessions see between 10 and 100 applicants. The number of applicants will vary depending on the employer’s industry, as well as the time of year the session is offered.


-
Employers from any industry can host On-Campus Recruiting Sessions!

-
Coffee chats and interview days must be scheduled between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on weekdays. Select exclusions may apply for holidays or conflicting large-scale events; please view our calendar in our annual

[Recruiting Guide](https://qrco.de/bfg78j). Should your organization require scheduling sessions outside of this period, please contact the Fordham Career Center team to see if your request can be accommodated. -

While interview days have the formal position listing attached to the interview schedule, coffee chats will have a general interest listing associated with the schedule.

The Career Center team will have a printed copy of your schedule and resume book ready for your arrival, as well as refreshments available for both you and your selected candidates in the waiting area. The Career Center team will also manage the waiting area as you meet with your scheduled candidates.
