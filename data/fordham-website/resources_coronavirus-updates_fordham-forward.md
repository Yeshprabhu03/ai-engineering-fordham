# Fordham Forward

## Latest Updates

**As of May 15, 2023, Fordham will not require members of the University community or visitors to be vaccinated against COVID.** Vaccinations and boosters will continue to be strongly recommended because they remain very effective in protecting each of us individually from serious illness and death.

The University will continue providing COVID vaccinations and testing to students as much as it can. Schedules will be posted on the [Health Services Page](/student-life/safety-health-and-wellness/health-services/). Employees should see their healthcare providers.

As of May 15, 2023, the University will no longer use VitalCheck to track vaccination status, nor to report COVID cases, and members of the on-campus community will no longer receive the daily VitalCheck questionnaire via text or email.

If you have questions, please email [vpforadministration@fordham. edu](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#433533252c3122272e2a2d2a30373122372a2c2d03252c31272b222e6d262736).
