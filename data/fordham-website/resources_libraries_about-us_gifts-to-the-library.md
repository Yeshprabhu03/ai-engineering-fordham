# Gifts to the Library

Fordham University Libraries are grateful for the generosity of patrons and friends, who have helped us build our collection.

Donations of Books, Videos and Sound Recordings Are Temporarily Suspended

The relocation and resizing of various library collections at both the Lincoln Center and Rose Hill libraries is causing a temporary shortage of shelf space and staff time, which requires us to suspend accepting gifts of books, video and sound recordings at this time.

Donations to the Special Collections and Archives

The Library’s Special Collections and Archives have distinct criteria for materials, including items relating to Fordham’s history. Please contact Gabriella DiMeglio, Archives and Special Collections Librarian, at
