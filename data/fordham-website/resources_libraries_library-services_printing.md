# Printing

## Overview

Ram Print is Fordham University's managed print service, allowing Faculty, Staff, Students, and Guests to securely print, copy, or scan materials at any Ram Print device. It includes a networked, multi-function device print platform available in departments, residence halls, and the library. It reduces costs by limiting the need for personal desktop printers, fax machines, hallway copiers, and scanners.

Faculty, staff, students, and guests will all use the same Canon printers through the PaperCut printing software.

Starting July 2024, we are upgrading the printers and implementing Papercut printing software. This upgrade will start with lab/student printing and will continue into the Fall for staff printing. For information about navigating the old printing systems, see [how to print with Uniflow and Pharos](https://www.fordham.edu/information-technology/it-services/printing-at-fordham/).
