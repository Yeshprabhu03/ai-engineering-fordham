# Procedure for a Student to Report an Academic Violation

If a student witnesses a violation of academic integrity or otherwise has reason to believe that a violation has occurred, they may choose among several possible courses of action.

A. Talk with the student, urging them to report their violation to the instructor of the course or to the chair of the AIC.

B. Discuss the observed action with the instructor, not naming those involved, to obtain guidance and determine if an observed act merits action under the Academic Integrity Policy.

C. Submit a written report to the chair of the AIC. If the student wishes to remain anonymous, the AIC will honor that request during the initial inquiry prior to a case review.
