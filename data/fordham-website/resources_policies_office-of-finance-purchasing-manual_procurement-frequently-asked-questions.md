# Procurement Frequently Asked Questions

-
**How do I keep track of a Requisition after it has been processed?**

The Purchase Requisition is a two-part form. Only one part (canary) is sent to the Purchasing Department after completion of the required fields. All users are advised to keep the second copy (green) of the Requisition before it is forwarded to the Purchasing Department. This will be your record of the Purchase Order until you have received the laser copy Purchase Order Confirmation.**What number do I enter in the LPO Number section at the top of the form?**

You must enter your department sequence number in the field on the form. The departmental sequence number should also be entered in the (SEQ.) field. This information will identify who is placing the order.**Why does the LPO contain two approval signatures and how do I know which one to use?**

There are two distinct approvals that occur during the LPO process. As a result, there are two separate fields for each approval. The first signature required is the LPO Approval Signature. This signature authorizes the actual placing of the order to the vendor. The second signature required is the Authorization Signature. This signature assures the goods or services have been received and payment for this order is approved.Note: Please be sure that signatures are entered in the correct order. Improper use of the signature field causes confusion and could cause a delay in the processing of your order.

**What steps do I take with the LPO after it has been completed?**

Completed forms are not sent to the Purchasing Department. The LPO is a three-part form and each part is designated for a specific user. Please use the following steps to complete the LPO process:- Complete all information that is required for the LPO.
- Send the vendor copy of the LPO to the vendor only, if it has not been faxed or called in.
- After goods/services are rendered and invoices are received, the Accounts Payable copy of the form is approved and forwarded to the Accounts Payable Department.
- Formal Purchase Orders are required for orders exceeding $5,000.
