# Procurement Special Programs

### Vendor Fair

Each spring Fordham’s Purchasing Department holds a Vendor Fair to acquaint the University community with the vendors and manufacturers with which we do business. This is a showcase for our vendors to share new products with the Fordham community and for us to see and touch the new products on the market.

This event is an informational cornucopia. Each year our Vendor Fair has been growing, and if you have any suggestions, we would love to hear them.

### Workshops

There are many times when reading information, is not the same as a face to face meeting. Since 2008, we have been hosting Purchasing Workshops, led by the Assistant Director, to explain the nuances of the Fordham Purchasing Department and the three P’s (policies, procedures, and paperwork) associated with the purchasing process from purchasing to payment.

The Workshop is available and held as needed, one-on-one, or for the entire department.
