# Receipt and Payment

The following describes the policy and procedure for receiving documentation.

- Simply sign the vendor invoice. Place the Purchase Order number on the invoice and forward same to the Accounts Payable Department.
**Mark the invoice “Final.”** - For partial shipments simply sign the vendor invoice. Place the Purchase Order number on the invoice and forward to the Accounts Payable Department.
**Mark the invoice “Partial.”**

Note: Since payment terms sometimes allow discounts for prompt payment, it is imperative that these approved invoices are processed without delay. Doing so ensures that the department ordering an item receives the prompt payment discount.

-
Items delivered directly to departments should be checked at the time of delivery for:

- Damage;
- Completeness; and
- Compliance with specifications.

**What to do with Damaged Items**Situation Action If the packaging is visibly damaged... Then it should be noted on the bill of lading when the item is signed for. If the package has concealed damage that is discovered after the carrier has left... The package must be saved, and the Purchasing Department must be contacted immediately to file a claim. -
Requests for returns and credits must be channeled through the Purchasing Department, which will contact the vendor to negotiate the return or credit.

- Often vendors will charge re-stocking costs and shipping charges for returns.
- Custom-made items and printed matter are usually not subject to return unless they are defective. The ordering department must absorb these charges.

If the department receives a credit:

- Written notification must be made to the Purchasing Department to inform them of the credit.
- The notification ensures that the funds encumbered for this Purchase Order are adjusted to reflect the credit and re-directed to the appropriate budget.

-
There is a time limitation for filing claims on all carrier-delivered materials (usually 30 days) and delays may result in disallowance of legitimate claims. The Purchasing Department should be notified immediately when mistakes in shipping are discovered.

-
A purchasing transaction is complete only after the goods or services have been received and the supplier has been paid. When a PO is issued, the department/university assumes responsibility to make sure the vendor is paid within an appropriate period of time. By issuing a PO, funds are properly encumbered and set-aside to pay these obligations. The encumbrance ensures that the required funding is available. Accounts Payable (AP) FMH 5th floor pays all invoices for Fordham University.

When a Purchase Order is used to complete a transaction with a vendor, payment of the invoice is simple. If the Vendor Invoice has the Purchase Order number, the invoice is signed by the appropriate signatory and sent to the Accounts Payable Department. If the invoice does indicate the Purchase Order number on it, please write in the appropriate number and then the Accounts Payable Department will process it against the Purchase Order, liquidating the funds, and paying the vendor. There is no need to send a Check Request.

If the payment is for a Partial Payment, please mark “Partial” on the invoice. “Final” will close out the Purchase Order and liquidate all funds pending in the encumbrance.

**Please highlight or circle the Purchase Order Number for faster processing.**Check Requests sent without referencing Purchase Order numbers will not liquidate funds from the encumbrance. Please note the PO number – if using a check request.

If you have an invoice over $5,000., please attach it to a Requisition for payment and processing. Note: Since payment terms often allow discounts for promptness, it is imperative that these approved invoices are processed without delay. Doing so ensures that the department ordering the item receives the prompt payment discount.

Pending and unpaid invoices can cause a vendor to stop shipments to other Fordham departments and to also cause

**negative results on the Fordham University Credit Reports.****Please send Invoices to the Accounts Payable Department promptly! The Accounts Payable Department needs time to process.**
