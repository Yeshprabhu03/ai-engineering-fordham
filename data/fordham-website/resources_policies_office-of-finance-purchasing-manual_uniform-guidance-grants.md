# Uniform Guidance: Grants

**The Federal Government's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) publishes guidance on the administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirement for grants and cooperative agreements.**

Uniform Guidance (“UG”) is a set of regulations (located at 2 CFR 200) that consolidates federal guidelines impacting research administration. Per the OMB website, this guidance “supersedes and streamlines requirements from OMB Circulars A-21, A-87, A-110, and A-122” (which have been placed in 2 C.F.R. Parts 220, 225, 215, and 230).

UG significantly reforms federal grant-making to focus resources on improving performance and outcomes. The intent is to reduce administrative burdens for grant applicants and recipients and to reduce the risk of waste, fraud, and abuse.

**Procurement guidance is specifically located in sections 200.317-200.326. This guidance focuses on increased competition and transparency in the procurement process.**

Fordham University’s Uniform Guidance Policy is found within the Office of Sponsored Programs Department under Academic Research.

Fordham University Procurement will be monitoring all requisitions to comply with all OMB Federal rules.
