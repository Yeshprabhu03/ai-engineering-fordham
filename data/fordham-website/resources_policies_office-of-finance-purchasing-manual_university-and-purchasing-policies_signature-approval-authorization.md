# Signature Approval Authorization

The Signature Approval Authority form is used to authorize and verify signatures for both Fordham Purchasing and Accounts Payable transactions. The Budget Managers have the ultimate responsibility for their budgets but may give authorization to others to sign various documents. Each level of approval has a distinct dollar value. Each level **must** get the level above to give them approval. (Example - Directors must get their Dean or Vice President to sign off/validate the form and their signature, etc.)

In order to sign **any** forms involved in payment or purchasing, these forms must be submitted to the Purchasing Department. Budget FOAPAL information is also needed on the form. Signature Authority is only given for the specific Budget authorized on the form.

**If the cost of the purchase is $10,000 or more, a second approval from the Vice President or Dean is required. (Unless given special authority). If any documents are received without proper authorization, they will be returned.**

Those individuals that are allowed to sign for Staples orders may or may not also be given authorization for requisitions or invoices. The Staples authorization form is separate from the Fordham Signature Authorization form and does not give one automatic authorization for anything but Staples orders.
