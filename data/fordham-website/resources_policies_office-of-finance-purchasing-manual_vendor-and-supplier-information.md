# Vendor and Supplier Information

Departments are encouraged to recommend vendors, particularly when they are aware of special pricing or specifications. When appropriate, the Purchasing Department will search for and contact other vendors to obtain competitive quotations before placing the order.

Positive efforts should be made to utilize **small, minority-owned and woman-owned** businesses as sources of supplies and services and to allow these sources the maximum feasible opportunity to compete for the University’s contracts.

**Vendors must comply with the Equal Opportunity Act** (Executive Order 11246 as amended). They must also comply with all federal, state, and local laws and directives. The Purchasing Department is committed to evaluating new suppliers, and whenever possible, more than one source will be sought and considered. Alternate or multiple sources of supply are maintained as a means of ensuring good value, performance, service, and of minimizing costs.
