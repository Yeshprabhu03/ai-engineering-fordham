# Vendor Pricing

We all have a favorite vendor. But are you sure that you are getting the Best Price? The only way to know - is to bid out the item or service. Fordham encourages every department to get the most for their money by getting more than one quote on an item or service and to include the competition to confirm the lowest price. Purchasing can help.

We have the experience and knowledge of information and agreements that are not available at the department level. Please call the Purchasing Department for further information.

**Note**: When using a quote or proposal from NYS/GSA or an E&I contract vendor, the bidding has already been completed by the entity involved.

If a department wishes to participate in obtaining quotes here are some things to know:

- A Request for Quotation (a bid) is the means of inviting price quotations from vendors via a list of materials, supplies, equipment and/or service specifications that the University intends to order.
- Always ask for a written quote, as phone quotes can be open to misinterpretation.
- All quotes and proposals should be dated and be on the vendor’s company stationery or emailed from a business email.
