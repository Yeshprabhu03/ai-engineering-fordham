# Current Student Privacy Notice in the E.U.

**Data Privacy Notice for Students Studying in the E.U. and U.K.**

This Notice describes Fordham University’s practices concerning the collection, use, storage, and disclosure (“processing”) of Personal Information covered by the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and GDPR U.K. about students studying in the European Union or the United Kingdom. This Notice applies to Fordham and its affiliated legal entities and branches (collectively “Fordham,” “us,” or “our”). All students studying at Fordham’s sites in the E.U. and U.K. (referred to below as “you” or “your”) should carefully read the provisions of this Privacy Notice.

“Personal Information,” as used in this Notice, means any information that can be used to identify you, whether directly or indirectly, including by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to your physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.

Additional notices at any data collection point may supplement this general Notice. Additionally, Fordham’s [Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) Policy](/resources/policies/family-educational-rights-and-privacy-act-ferpa-policy/) affords students certain rights concerning their education records.

If you have specific questions about any data processing activities described in this or any other Notice, please contact the [Office of Legal Counsel](#OLC).

**The Information We Process About You**

We process the information we collect from you directly, including, but not limited to, when you apply to study abroad, during our communications with you, when you sign up for classes or other services when you make use of Fordham equipment, facilities, and resources when you take classes when you apply for financial aid when you make use of the student health center, and when you make use of other required or optional services as a member of the Fordham community. This includes information about you created by our faculty and staff, for example, your grades, scores, records of attendance and participation, and recorded observations about you. It also includes information about your payments made to us for tuition and other expenses.

In some cases, we will require that certain information be provided in order for us to provide you with a service or take the action you request. We will indicate when such information is required, and failure to provide required or mandatory information may result in our being unable to provide you with a service or take action your request.

We use automated decision-making processes to process your data in certain contexts. For example, we may automatically evaluate your grades or test scores to determine your eligibility for enrollment in certain programs, receipt of honors, or offer you academic support. Similarly, the information in your financial aid application may generate a profile of your financial circumstances to decide your eligibility for scholarships, loans, and other financial assistance throughout your enrollment at Fordham. You can learn more about the logic we use in our automated decision-making processes by contacting [Enrollment Services](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ee8b809c818282ae88819c8a868f83c08b8a9b).

In addition, we collect the following kinds of information about you from third parties:

- Information we collect from other students or Fordham staff: Other students may provide information about you, whether by reporting an incident or complaint on campus, alerting us to an emergency involving you, or through campus activities. This information can include your name, information about your behavior or activities, and other information about the situation being reported to us.
- Information we receive about you from journals, research publications, or other platforms through which you publish academic content.
- Health, wellness, and insurance information about you that we receive from other healthcare providers or insurance companies.
- Information we collect about your prior or concurrent educational history from other academic institutions (or from our records in the event of a re-enrollment or enrollment for a different degree).

Fordham maintains video surveillance and card swipe systems for the security of our premises. Fordham or our contracted service operator may process images and video of you, and information about your use of and access to our premises, in connection with the operation of these systems.

**Purposes and Legal Basis for Processing Your Data**

We process your Personal Information to operate Fordham and the programs you are enrolled in, to provide you with financial aid, and to provide you with additional related services (like housing, internet access, and health services through the Student Health Center and other programs). We also use this data to:

- You can obtain additional information about our legitimate interests in processing your information by contacting
[Enrollment Services](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#97f2f9e5f8fbfbd7f1f8e5f3fff6fab9f2f3e2). - During your enrollment, we may also be required to process your Personal Information to complete a contract that you have entered into with us, including to be admitted to a program or receive financial aid, housing, or another service from us.
- You can obtain additional information regarding the processing we do to enter into contracts with you by contacting
[Enrollment Services](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#75101b071a191935131a07111d14185b101100). - We may also be required to process your Personal Information to comply with laws applicable in the European Union or its member states, such as immigration laws or laws requiring reporting personal information to the city administration for local registration purposes.

In the case of Sensitive Personal Information (which includes (i) information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership; (ii) genetic and biometric data, and (iii) data concerning health, sex life, or sexual orientation), we process information either (i) because we have your consent to do so, (ii) because we are required to process the information to comply with applicable laws or (iii) because processing is necessary for the provision of healthcare to you. We may also process sensitive data where necessary to protect your vital interests, and you are physically or legally incapable of giving consent, for example, to admit you to the hospital if you are sick or injured and unable to complete the admission information on your own.

You can obtain more information about our processing of Sensitive Personal Information by contacting the [Office of Legal Counsel](#OLC). When we process your Sensitive Personal Information based on your consent, you may withdraw that consent at any time by contacting the [Office of Legal Counsel](#OLC). If you withdraw your consent, we may still be required to process your Sensitive Personal Information to comply with applicable law, but we will explain to you what processing activities will continue for legal compliance purposes when your consent is withdrawn.

Finally, we process your Personal Information for additional purposes compatible with those already described, including conducting scientific, statistical, or historical research or creating archives in the public interest. Where possible, we do not use identifiable information for these purposes, or we take steps, including using pseudonymous data, to limit the amount of Personal Information we use in our research or archives.

**Recipients of Your Personal Information**

Your Personal Information will be received and processed by Fordham employees and personnel, including third parties who provide services to Fordham in connection with the purposes of processing described above. For example, we may disclose your information to service providers who help us make travel arrangements, support our information technology systems, or provide services to our students. We share your Personal Information with our service providers only when they have agreed to process your Personal Information only to provide services to us and have agreed to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure. You may contact the [Office of Legal Counsel](#OLC) to learn more about the categories of service providers to whom your data is disclosed.
