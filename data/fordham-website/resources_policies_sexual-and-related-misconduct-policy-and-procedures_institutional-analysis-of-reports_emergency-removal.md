# Emergency Removal: Sexual and Related Misconduct Policy

Unless prohibited by applicable law, the University will remove a Respondent from an education program or activity, living or working environment on an emergency basis if, following a safety and risk analysis of reported misconduct, the University determines that: (1) the respondent is an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of another community member; or (2) there is serious or immediate harm to the Respondent or others.

Respondents will be provided with notice and an opportunity to challenge the decision immediately following the removal. Students who wish to appeal an emergency removal must submit an appeal to the Vice President for Student Affairs or their designee. For allegations under Title IX , employees who wish to appeal an emergency removal must submit an appeal to the Vice President for Human Resources or their designee. Appeals of an emergency removal must be submitted to the relevant administrator within 5 (five) business days.

The University retains the authority to place an employee-respondent on administrative leave in accordance with all policies, collective bargaining agreements and/or the University Statutes, as applicable.
