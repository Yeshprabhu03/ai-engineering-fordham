# Other Sexual and Related Misconduct

Reports submitted to the University will be analyzed upon receipt. The Title IX Coordinator or their designee will determine if a report of sexual or related misconduct is within the scope of other sexual and related misconduct. If the conduct falls under other sexual and related misconduct, the University’s investigation and adjudication process will apply to the Formal Complaint.
