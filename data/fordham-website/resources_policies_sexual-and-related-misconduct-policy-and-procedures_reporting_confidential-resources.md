# Confidential Resources

Community members may wish to talk about their experiences in a supportive, confidential space that allows them to discuss and process their feelings with administrators or staff members who do not have a duty to report incidents of sexual or related misconduct. For this reason, **the University offers Confidential Resources – trained administrators and staff members who are not subject to the mandatory reporting provisions in the Policy and Procedures – to our community members.**

The following** Confidential Resources** are available to the University community:

**Counseling and Psychological Services**

Rose Hill Campus: (718) 817-3725

Lincoln Center Campus: (212) 636-6225

Westchester Campus: (914) 367-3733

**University Health Services**

Except in limited circumstances, communications with the Confidential Resources listed above will not be shared with the Title IX Coordinator, the Department of Public Safety, the Deans of Students, or any other member of the University community. Please note that Confidential Resources must report sexual and related misconduct when: (1) a community member is likely to engage in conduct that would result in serious harm to themselves or others; or (2) there is reasonable cause to suspect that a minor has been sexually abused.

It is important to note that Confidential Resources may not be able to provide the full range of accommodations and supportive measures that Public Safety, the Deans of Students, the Title IX Coordinator, or Human Resources can arrange (e.g., changes to academic schedules, housing, and work schedules).

Consistent with the mandatory reporting section below, **all other faculty, staff, and administrators have a duty to report all incidents of sexual and related misconduct they learn of or reasonably suspect**. All non-Confidential Resources will maintain community members’ privacy to the greatest extent permitted under the Policy and Procedures.
