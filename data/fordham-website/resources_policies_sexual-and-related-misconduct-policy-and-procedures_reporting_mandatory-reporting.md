# Mandatory Reporting

**When any faculty member, administrator, or staff member who has not been designated as a Confidential Resource observes, learns, or reasonably suspects a student or University employee has experienced sexual or related misconduct, that faculty member, staff member, or administrator must report all relevant details of the incident to the Title IX Coordinator, the Deans of Students for the campuses, the Vice President for Student Affairs, the Department of Public Safety, or Human Resources**. Reporting this information ensures that individuals who experience sexual or related misconduct are informed of their rights and options as well as the full range of resources available to them. Faculty members, staff members, and administrators are not required to report if they are the person who has experienced the sexual or related misconduct.

**Faculty members, staff members, or administrators who do not know if they are obligated to report an incident should contact the Title IX Coordinator or Human Resources to discuss the proper steps to take. **

Failure to make a report may result in disciplinary action.
