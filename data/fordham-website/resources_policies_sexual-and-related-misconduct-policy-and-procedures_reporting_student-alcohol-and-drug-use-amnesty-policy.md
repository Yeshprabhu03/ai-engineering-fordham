# Student Alcohol and Drug-Use Amnesty Policy: Sexual and Related Misconduct Policy

A reporting individual acting in good faith or a bystander acting in good faith that discloses any incident of sexual or related misconduct to University officials or law enforcement will not be subject to adjudication under the University’s Code of Conduct for violations of alcohol and/or drug use policies occurring at or near the time of the commission of the sexual or related misconduct.

The University takes this position because the health and safety of every student at Fordham University is of utmost importance. The University recognizes that students under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or other intoxicants at the time of sexual or related misconduct may be hesitant to report such incidents due to fear of potential consequences for their own conduct. The University strongly encourages students to report sexual and related misconduct to institution officials.
