# Sexual Harassment: Sexual and Related Misconduct Policy

**Sexual Harassment:** Unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that is severe, pervasive, or persistent, including but not limited to sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, and:

- Submission to or rejection of such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of a person’s employment, academic standing, or status in a program, course, or activity; or
- Submission to or rejection of such conduct by a person is used as the basis for employment or educational decisions affecting that person, or for academic evaluation, grades, or advancement; or
- Such conduct is sufficiently severe, pervasive, or persistent to have the purpose or reasonable effect of interfering with a person’s work or educational performance, or of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work or educational environment.

The effect of the conduct will be evaluated based upon the perspective of a reasonable person in the position of the complainant. Some examples of sexual harassment include, but are not limited to:

- Stating an intention or threat to expose another person’s sexual orientation or sexual experiences with others;
- A direct or implied threat that submission to sexual advances is a condition to participate in a living, working, or learning group or activity; and
- Severe, pervasive, or persistent comments of a sexual nature, including jokes and remarks about sexual experiences.
