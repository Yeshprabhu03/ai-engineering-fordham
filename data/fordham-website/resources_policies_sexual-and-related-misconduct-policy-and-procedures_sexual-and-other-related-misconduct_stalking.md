# Stalking: Sexual and Related Misconduct Policy

**Stalking:** Engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to: (i) fear for their safety or the safety of others; or (ii) suffer substantial emotional distress.

For purposes of this definition, “course of conduct” means two or more acts, including acts in which the respondent, directly, indirectly, or through third parties, by any method monitors, observes, follows, surveils, threatens, or communicates to or about a person or interferes with a person’s property.

For purposes of this definition, “reasonable person” means a reasonable person under similar circumstances and with similar identities to the complainant. “Substantial emotional distress” means significant mental anguish or suffering that may, but does not necessarily, require professional treatment or counseling.
