# Course Enrollment

## 1.1 Registration

Continuing students register online via the portal fall semester courses during the spring term, and for spring semester courses during the fall term. Incoming first-year students register during the summer with oversight from their class deans; incoming transfer students will be registered by a designated dean in their respective college/school. Students with schedule problems should contact their class dean or academic advisor (FCRH, FCLC, and GSB) or advising dean (PCS), depending on their affiliation. All override requests should be directed to associate chairs (FCRH and FCLC), advising deans (PCS), or area chairs (GSB).

## 1.2 Required Reporting

The **Faculty tab** of the portal provides accurate, real-time class information on students enrolled in your course see ( [section 7.4](/resources/policies/undergraduate-faculty-handbook/planning-for-classes-policies-and-resources/) for more details).

**Required Reporting:** There are four reports that are required for all instructional staff each semester. These reports must be filled out via your my.fordham.edu account. Academic Records will contact you via your Fordham email with instructions when these reports are coming up. The reports and tentative **due **dates are noted below.

**Initial Student Attendance**(identified as Class Attendance Reporting on the Faculty Dashboard in the portal): the week following the end of add/drop (check the Academic Calendar for due date of Round 1, Last Date of Attendance);-
**Midterm Evaluations**(entered using a link that will be emailed to you from Academic Records): the week following midterm week (check the Academic Calendar for due date of mid-semester evaluations); **Late Semester Student Attendance**(identified as Class Attendance Reporting on the Faculty Dashboard in the portal): the eighth or ninth week of classes (check the Academic Calendar for due date of Round 2, Last Date of Attendance);**Final Course Grades**(identified as Enter Final Grades Here on the Faculty Dashboard in the portal): begins the week of final exams (check the Academic Calendar for these events). In the spring semester, grades for seniors must be submitted within 48 hours of the final exam date.

Please note that we no longer use Midterm Grades; in the Midterm Evaluation, all students receive notice as to whether they are at risk in the class, and those who are at risk receive an alert indicating the nature of their deficiency/ies.

**In the event the student stops attending your course at any time during the semester, you must notify via email the Office of Academic Records (****[email protected]****) as well as the student’s advising dean or, at PCS, the respective assistant or associate dean.** The email should contain the student’s name, FIDN, the course subject/number/section, the CRN, and the student’s last date of attendance. Please notify the appropriate dean if there are any student(s) attending your course whose name is not on the attendance report. The student will not receive credit for the course unless their name is on the official course list.
