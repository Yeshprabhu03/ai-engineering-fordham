## 8.1 Counseling and Psychological Services

[Fordham’s Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS)](https://www.fordham.edu/student-life/safety-health-and-wellness/counseling-and-psychological-services/) is a comprehensive mental health center that is dedicated to promoting the emotional and psychological health and wellness of our students. At CPS, we recognize that University life can be stressful due to academic, financial, family, and social pressures. These stressors can sometimes contribute to or exacerbate more significant psychological problems, such as depression, anxiety, substance abuse, trauma, or difficulties with sleeping, eating, or attention. CPS provides a range of services to help students address and cope more effectively with their stress and psychological concerns. No matter what challenges students are experiencing, our free and confidential services can help them better understand their difficulties, develop more self-awareness, and enhance their coping skills, academic performance, self-esteem, relationships, and overall well-being.

The CPS hours during the academic year are Monday to Thursday, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.; Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Summer hours are Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The CPS contact information is as follows:

## 8.2 Office of Disability Services

The [Office of Disability Services (ODS)](https://www.fordham.edu/student-life/disability-services/) works with students, faculty, and staff to ensure appropriate services for students with disabilities. Fordham University will make reasonable accommodations and provide auxiliary aids and services to assist otherwise qualified persons in achieving access to its programs, services, and facilities in accordance with Section 504 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Faculty must implement the accommodations given by ODS.

Applicants who have been accepted for admission or current students who would like Fordham to accommodate a disability are required to contact the Office of Disability Services at 718-817-0655 to arrange an intake appointment, submit current documentation, and develop their accommodation plan with ODS staff. The Rose Hill office is located on the lower level of O’Hare Hall, and the Lincoln Center office is in Lowenstein 408. When calling, students should specify whether they are a Lincoln Center or Rose Hill student. Students are not eligible to receive academic accommodations until they complete the registration process with ODS.

ODS requests that all faculty members include the following standard statement in each class syllabus in order to increase awareness of the services that ODS provides and encourage students with disabilities to self-identify in order to properly access their accommodations:

“If you are a student with a documented disability and require academic accommodations, please register with the Office of Disability Services for Students (ODS) in order to request academic accommodations for your courses. Please contact the main ODS number at 718-817-0655 to arrange services. Accommodations are not retroactive, so you need to register with ODS prior to receiving your accommodations. Please see me after class or during office hours if you have questions or would like to submit your academic accommodation letter to me if you have previously registered for accommodations.”

The primary mission of the Office of Academic Advising for Student-Athletes is to provide Fordham University’s more than 500 NCAA student-athletes with the resources and direction needed to achieve their scholastic potential and to prepare them for post-graduate scholastic, athletic, and career opportunities. The office brings a breadth and depth of experience in athletics and higher education to their many responsibilities.

## 8.8 **The Office for Prestigious Fellowships**

Fordham strongly encourages eligible students to compete for fellowships and grants. [The Office for Prestigious Fellowships](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/student-fellowships/office-of-prestigious-fellowships/) connects students with these opportunities. Students who apply for these awards receive support for research and advanced studies, and the application process often yields important long-term benefits. Many award competitions demand immediate action during the first few weeks of classes in the fall, particularly those competitions of interest to graduating seniors. Those students who intend to apply for external scholarships should contact Dr. Lorna Ronald ([[email protected]](http://lronald@fordham.edu/)). The Campion Institute’s offices are located in Thebaud Hall 106, 107, and 108 and in Martino Hall 715, 716.

The Office of Prestigious Fellowships holds meetings and workshops that alert students to different opportunities and provide guidance on different elements of the application process, such as proposal writing and interviewing techniques. Certain students are recommended to work closely with faculty mentors in composing their fellowship applications. More information, especially about individual fellowships, may be found at [fordham.edu/fellowships](https://www.fordham.edu/fellowships).

The Office of Prestigious Fellowships is part of the Campion Institute, which was created to advance excellence throughout the University, thus enhancing the University's reputation both nationally and internationally. Under the patronage of the 16th-century scholar and martyr St. Edmund Campion, the institute exists to encourage students to undertake ever more challenging intellectual opportunities in the Ignatian tradition of *magis*, through the development of discernment and *eloquentia perfecta*, not merely for self-interest but more for the service of humanity.

This office also provides the students with personal counseling, information on health insurance requirements and banking, and programs to promote cross-cultural and international understanding. Our office also serves as a resource for our academic departments and administrative offices on immigration matters regarding our international faculty, researchers, and scholars. OIS also coordinates and administers Fordham’s faculty international network and its pertinent events.

For more information, you can contact the OIS office at 718-817-3145 or email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#92fdfbe1d2f4fde0f6faf3ffbcf7f6e7).

### 8.9.2 Institute of American Language and Culture (IALC)

[The Institute of American Language and Culture (IALC)](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/academic-resources/esl/) is the Fordham English as a Second Language (ESL) program. Courses are available to all non-native English speakers—those currently enrolled in a Fordham credit program, those intending to enroll in a Fordham program in the future, and those who simply want to improve their English language skills for personal or professional reasons.

The IALC office is located at the Lincoln Center Campus, on the third floor of Martino Hall. The majority of IALC courses and workshops take place in the Lowenstein Center at 113 West 60th Street. A limited number of courses and workshops for matriculated students take place at the Rose Hill campus during the academic year.

Professors and administrators are encouraged to refer students, friends, colleagues, relatives, and family members in need of English language assistance to the IALC program for English proficiency evaluation and possible participation/enrollment in academic workshops and/or classes. A combination of traditional ESL courses (which address reading, writing, grammar, speaking, listening and vocabulary skills) and content-based courses (designed to bridge the gap between English language studies and university-level content courses) are offered. Fordham undergraduate students may receive college credit for College ESL Writing 1 or 2.

For more information, contact James Stabler-Havener, director of IALC at 212-636-7994 or [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6a0f19062a0c05180e020b07440f0e1f).

### 8.9.3 Fordham Global Transition Program

All international students are required to attend a Global Transition Program during the week preceding New Student Orientation. On the first morning, all non-native English speakers take the Fordham English Language Test (FELT) administered by Fordham’s Institute of American Language and Culture. Based on the results of this exam and students’ planned academic curriculum, students may be enrolled in two ESL courses—College Writing (ILAC 2026) for six credits and Sociology of American Culture (SOCI 1025) for three credits—for their first semester. In order to register for at least 15 credits for their first semester, these students will also enroll in courses that fulfill the core/major requirements

Global Transition also includes a thorough introduction to American academic culture and Fordham’s particular curriculum, academic processes, resources, and expectations.

### 8.9.4 International and Study Abroad Programs

Drawing on a longstanding tradition in Jesuit education, the [International and Study Abroad Programs Office](https://www.fordham.edu/study-abroad/) staff is committed to supporting and promoting global diversity as well as helping undergraduate students gain an understanding of some of the complexities that stem from our increasingly interconnected and interdependent world. Opportunities for study abroad include Fordham Semester Programs (Fordham in Granada, Fordham in London, and Fordham University Ubuntu Program), exchange programs at universities worldwide, and short-term programs

during the winter intersession, spring, and summer. We are a University that places a high value on respecting and learning from the experiences of international students, faculty, and staff.

Across the University, there is a deep commitment to sending Fordham into the world and bringing the world to Fordham. These concepts reflect the administration’s embrace of the idea that students must push their boundaries by experiencing new places and cultures, and its commitment to cultivating a truly international community at Rose Hill and Lincoln Center.

Under the umbrella of sending Fordham into the world are programs designed to help all students—domestic and international—develop a global mindset through international study. Both short- and long-term study abroad opportunities are available to accommodate all students’ schedules and learning goals. Semester-long programs are offered at our own London Centre and in collaboration with worldwide university partners. For students who seek a shorter commitment, Global Immersion programs offer academic travel experiences of seven to 10 days. These are connected directly with a business course, and the travel components take place during school breaks: winter, spring, or at the end of the school year in May.

Bringing the world to Fordham also requires the utmost attention to globalization in the classroom. Faculty are encouraged to integrate global course content into every aspect of their classes so that students can learn about the world even while at home.

### 8.9.5 Gabelli School of Business Global Programming

Several global initiatives are being designed for domestic, international, and exchange students to extend their knowledge of the global business environment. A variety of short-term and long-term study abroad programs and global experiential learning opportunities are offered either through Fordham London or in collaboration with our world-wide university partners. Additionally, Global Immersion Programs are integrated within a few business classes and include international trips that take place over winter or spring break or at the end of a semester.

Business students at Rose Hill who choose Global Business as a secondary concentration receive academic advising in their program of study. They are provided with information on available courses, specialized advising, and membership in the International Business Association, a student organization.

The Gabelli School of Business provides different programming to engage students with the international business world. For example, International Business Week features keynote speakers and a host of other events on the theme of global business. The week starts with a cultural showcase kickoff and includes various panel discussions and events on both campuses.

**The international student association serves the needs of all international students at the Gabelli Rose Hill campus, with the purpose of engaging the international student community at large, involving both Fordham College and Gabelli School student populations in meaningful activities, and strengthening the diversity and global initiatives within the Fordham community.**

The business school participates in Fordham’s Global Transition Program, which provides an early-arrival, five-day orientation for new international students that combines academic, administrative, and social activities to ease the transition this population typically experiences. In addition, course registration for international Gabelli students is strategically adjusted to allow for transition to full-time English language coursework, and students are language-tested to ensure the best possible class placements.
