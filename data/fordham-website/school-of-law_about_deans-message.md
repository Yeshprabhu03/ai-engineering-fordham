Law pervades the most pressing issues facing our world. Whether working in a prestigious law firm or the public sector, lawyers are at the forefront of fighting for criminal justice and civil rights, safeguarding privacy and data security, protecting the environment and economic rights, or defending free speech, religious rights, and democracy itself. In every field, lawyers play a pivotal role in shaping our society.

Fordham Law School occupies a special place in the legal profession, and we have a great team. Our faculty are leaders in their fields and are dedicated to teaching, ensuring that our graduates are well-prepared for the demands of the profession. Our administrative and staff professionals support our students on a range of important matters and are excited to help them explore all that law and law school have to offer. Our students come from all over the world, bringing tremendous diversity, vast breadth of knowledge, and an incredible range of experiences. And our alumni—experts in so many areas—love to give back and constantly show up to teach, mentor, and hire our students in the many reaches of the profession they represent.

Fordham Law is well-positioned to address the major challenges of our time, from the rapid technological advances transforming legal practice to the heightened polarization straining legal and political institutions. We are a hub for exploring critical issues on local, national, and global levels, and we are dedicated to empowering our students and graduates to engage deeply in crucial conversations while contributing to reforms that address our most pressing problems. As a Jesuit institution deeply committed to service, we resolutely adhere to our values while maximizing our impact. This includes opening doors for students facing barriers to a legal education and ensuring a community grounded in inclusion.

Fordham lawyers stand out for their preparedness, with a unique capacity to assess legal problems and devise practical solutions. They understand that law is a service profession and are known for their leadership at law firms, public interest organizations, the judiciary, and more. As dean, my foremost commitment is that our students excel throughout their legal education and thrive in their careers.

It is an honor to be Fordham Law’s dean. I encourage you to explore our website to see the many opportunities a Fordham Law education can offer. The best way to get to know us is to visit our state-of-the-art campus. Located in the heart of Manhattan across from Lincoln Center, we look forward to welcoming you so that you can see for yourself what a difference Fordham and a Fordham Law degree can make in your future.


Warmly,

**Joseph Landau**

Dean and Paul Fuller Professor of Law
