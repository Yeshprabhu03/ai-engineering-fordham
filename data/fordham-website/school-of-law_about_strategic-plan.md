# Fordham Law Strategic Plan

## Fordham lawyers are smart, know the law, have strong judgment, and possess the skills to solve real-world problems.

Whether they are employed by firms, businesses, government agencies, or community organizations, Fordham lawyers are committed to service with an integrity that is a hallmark of Fordham’s Jesuit tradition. Fordham lawyers serve clients and the public at the highest levels as counselors, problem solvers, advocates, and leaders.

These qualities stem from and reflect Fordham Law School’s unique approach to legal education, which is grounded in deep commitments to excellence, an ethos of care, valuing the individual while building community, and the belief that law and lawyers can nurture human flourishing. Located in new and stunning surroundings in the greatest city in the world, Fordham Law School offers students the extraordinary advantages of a large institution of learning while providing individualized training, focus, and mentorship from our world-class faculty. And Fordham’s extended network of dedicated alumni helps create opportunities within the profession while ensuring that the Law School itself remains strong.
