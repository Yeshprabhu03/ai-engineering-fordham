# International, Comparative, and Foreign Law

### We live in an increasingly globalized, interdependent world.

If you are interested in a legal career involving diplomacy, counseling government agencies, nonprofit advocacy, trade law, cross-border transactions, private practice abroad, and international arbitration, then this Concentration is for you.

The Concentration in international, comparative, and foreign law integrates three sub-fields of law that provide paths for legal practice in multilateral institutions, government agencies, NGOs, law firms, and private sector work involving international and transnational law.

Courses and faculty

Foundational, electives in specialized areas, and experiential courses compose the international, comparative, and foreign law Concentration. You are also encouraged to take a writing course.

Please note that not all courses are offered every semester. Current students can log in to LawNET([https://my.lawnet.fordham.edu/sites/jdconcentrations/SitePages/International-Comparative-and-Foreign-Law.aspx](https://my.lawnet.fordham.edu/sites/jdconcentrations/SitePages/International-Comparative-and-Foreign-Law.aspx)) for the most up-to-date course listing.
