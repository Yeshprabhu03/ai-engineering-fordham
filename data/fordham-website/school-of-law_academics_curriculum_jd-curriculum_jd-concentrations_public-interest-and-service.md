# Public Interest and Service

### “In the service of others” is more than the Law School’s motto; it is also a career path.

The public interest and service Concentration prepares you to fight injustice and to help empower and advocate for disenfranchised individuals and communities.

It is flexible enough for you to develop a set of courses that is tailored to your interests and career objectives. And it gives you a solid substantive grounding in the field that will signal to employers that you are ready for a variety of public interest positions or important careers in government.

Course and faculty

Foundational, specialized, and experiential, practicum, and writing courses compose the public interest and service Concentration. You are also encouraged to take courses that strengthen your writing and research skills and to participate in one or more student groups housed in the Public Interest Resource Center.

Please note that not all courses are offered every semester. Current students can log in to LawNET ([https://my.lawnet.fordham.edu/sites/jdconcentrations/SitePages/Public-Interest-and-Service.aspx](https://my.lawnet.fordham.edu/sites/jdconcentrations/SitePages/Public-Interest-and-Service.aspx)) for the most up-to-date course listing.
