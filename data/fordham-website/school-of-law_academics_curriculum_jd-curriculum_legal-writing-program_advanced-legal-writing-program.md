# Advanced Legal Writing Program

The Advanced Legal Writing Program offers over 40 elective classes each year and is one of the most extensive upper-level writing programs in the nation. Each Advanced Legal Writing course is limited to 12 students and is taught by a practitioner with expertise in a particular field. Students in these courses learn how to draft documents in a specific area such as civil litigation, criminal litigation, commercial law, intellectual property, trusts and estates, and employment law.

Although not every advanced course is offered every semester, the most popular courses – such as Civil Litigation Drafting and Commercial Drafting – are offered each semester in multiple sections. There is no recommended sequencing for the Advanced Legal Writing courses. It is strongly recommended that students take at least one Advanced Legal Writing course prior to graduation.

Enrollment Information for Advanced Legal Writing Courses

*A student may enroll in only one Advanced Legal Writing course each semester. A student may not repeat any advanced Legal Writing course (all sections of Commercial Drafting, Civil Litigation Drafting and Intellectual Property Drafting count as the same course). All Advanced Legal Writing courses satisfy the upper-level skills requirement but do not satisfy the Upper-Class Writing Requirement.*

*There is no pre-requisite for any Advanced Legal Writing Course unless specifically indicated below.*
