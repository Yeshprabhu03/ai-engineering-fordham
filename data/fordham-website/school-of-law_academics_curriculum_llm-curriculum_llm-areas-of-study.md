Students who participate in this program must complete a minimum of 36 credits in total. Specialized credits cannot be double counted between the two concentrations; students must separately fulfill the requirements of each program and a course that is counted for one specialization may not be simultaneously counted toward the second specialization (requests for exceptions to this rule will be considered on case-by-case basis).


The Dual-Concentration option gives LL.M. students the opportunity to remain at Fordham Law for an additional semester of full-time study (or the equivalent for part-time students) to complete 12 credits in a second LL.M. discipline, at the end of which time the student would receive the LL.M. degree in two disciplines (for example, “LL.M. Degree in International Business and Trade Law and International Dispute Resolution”). Any two of our nine LL.M. concentrations can be combined in this way, provided that the student is able to meet the requirements of both programs. In addition to giving students the opportunity to fully explore a second area of study, the addition of a third semester will give students greater flexibility to pursue opportunities such as externships and clinics that may be difficult to complete in just two semesters. Note that students who wish to take a bar examination may opt to do so after two semesters of study as long as they have completed all of the requirements for one of the degree programs at the end of two semesters (and provided that they fulfill all the requirements imposed by the relevant bar authority). For more information, see law.fordham.edu/llm/dual-concentration and schedule a meeting with Anthony Agolia for advising by emailing [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Please note that the two concentrations will only be reflected on your transcript, not on the diploma itself.
