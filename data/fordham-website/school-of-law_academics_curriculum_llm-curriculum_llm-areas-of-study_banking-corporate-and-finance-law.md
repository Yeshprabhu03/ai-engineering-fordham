# Banking, Corporate, and Finance Law

Students in the LL.M. program in Banking, Corporate, and Finance Law acquire a sophisticated appreciation of corporate structure, an understanding of the laws relating to capital markets and financial institutions, and genuine insights into the goals and strategies of U.S. executives and business lawyers. In this program, students enroll in core courses including Corporations, International Banking Law, Financial Institutions:Banking Law and choose from a broad array of additional courses in corporate, banking, and finance law and related topics. Through these courses, students explore such areas as bankruptcy, corporate finance, corporate governance, corporate tax, cross-border insolvency, mergers and acquisitions, and securities regulation and enforcement.

-
Each student is required to complete a minimum of 24 credits of approved courses; the maximum number of credits permitted is 30.

Full-time students take 10-15 credits per semester (11-13 recommended); part-time students take 2-9 credits per semester and must complete the program within 24 months of starting. Up to 4 credits may be taken during summer terms.

-
The 24-credit minimum must include 12 credits of Specialization Distribution Courses approved for the Banking, Corporate, and Finance Law program.

The 12-credit Specialization Distribution Course requirement includes the following Core Course:

- Corporations

And at least one of the following Core Distribution Courses:

- Banking Regulation & Enforcement
- Federal Regulation of Investment Companies
- Financial Regulation and Innovation
- International/Global Banking Law
- Market Structure Regulation, Trading and Risk Management
- Regulation of Financial Institutions
- Securities Regulation (check prerequisites)

We recommend that students in this program register for Corporations during their first semester of study (or shortly thereafter for part-time students), as Corporations may be a pre-requisite for many other courses of interest.

Remaining credits needed to fulfill the 12-credit Specialization Distribution requirement must be chosen from among the wide selection of Specialization Distribution Courses approved for the Banking, Corporate, and Finance Law program (courses designated 'BCF' on the

[class schedule](https://myweb.lawnet.fordham.edu/sites/classschedules)). -
All LL.M. students are required to complete the following course:

- Quantitative Methods for Graduate Students (required in first semester of study)*

All LL.M. students who do not hold a J.D. from a U.S. law school are additionally required to take the following courses:

- Introduction to the U.S. Legal System and Process (required in first semester of study)**
- Legal Writing and Research for LLM Students (required in first semester of study)**
- Introduction to the U.S. Legal Profession***+

[Content Outline courses](/school-of-law/academics/curriculum/llm-curriculum/llm-areas-of-study/content-outline-courses/)*** - Fundamental Lawyering Skills for LLM Students****
- 2 credits of experiential coursework****

Students are required to take Introduction to the U.S. Legal System and Process and Legal Writing and Research for LLM Students during their first semester of study in the LLM program.

Note: If a course fulfills both a Specialization Distribution Course requirement and a Content Outline requirement, the course may count toward both requirements. For example, Corporations (4 credits) counts towards the Specialization Distribution Course requirement and also counts toward the Content Outline requirement.

** Students who completed a similar course in their prior studies, or who have significant business, tax, or other experience that provides them with sufficient knowledge of this topic may seek a waiver by submitting the*[Request for Waiver from LL.M./M.S.L. Program Requirements](https://v2.go.lawnet.fordham.edu/sites/internationalprograms/forms/SitePages/Registration Enrollment Forms.aspx)form.

A note regarding course selection for part time students

The LL.M. program strives to ensure that there is a wide range of courses available in the evening in each of our LL.M. areas of specialization, and to ensure that students will be able to meet their program requirements within their desired time frame for completion.

However, it would be impossible to ensure that any specific course will be offered at a time that is convenient to all students. We encourage you to look at the schedules from past semesters, available on the [registrar's website](https://myweb.lawnet.fordham.edu/sites/classschedules/SitePages/Home.aspx), to get a sense of what courses may be offered in the future (noting, of course, that the schedule varies from one semester to the next).

Should you find at any time that you are having trouble meeting your program requirements within your desired time frame, you should contact Anthony Agolia at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#86e7e7e1e9eaefe7c6eae7f1a8e0e9f4e2eee7eba8e3e2f3) to discuss options.
