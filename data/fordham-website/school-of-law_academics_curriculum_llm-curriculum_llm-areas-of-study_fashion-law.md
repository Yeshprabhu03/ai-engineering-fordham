# Fashion Law

LL.M. students in the Fashion Law program will study with the most distinguished faculty in the discipline, including both academics and industry insiders—in New York City, a capital of the world’s fashion industry.

You will explore what we’ve defined as the four pillars of fashion law:

- Intellectual property
- Business and finance, including areas such as investment, employment law, and real estate
- International trade and government regulation, including sustainability, privacy, and issues related to wearable technology
- Consumer culture and civil rights

You’ll also gain direct access to events and networking opportunities available through the nonprofit [Fashion Law Institute](http://fashionlawinstitute.com/). Established with the assistance of the [Council of Fashion Designers of America](http://cfda.com/), it’s the world’s first center dedicated to the law and business of fashion—and it’s based at Fordham Law.

Each student is required to complete a minimum of 24 credits of approved courses; the maximum number of credits permitted is 30.

The Fashion Law Institute pioneered the placement of legal interns at fashion brands. Students within our program have served as interns at companies throughout the New York area. Louis Vuitton, Prada, Michael Kors, Ralph Lauren, Gucci, Coach, Cushnie et Ochs, and SoulCycle are just a few of the brands where our students have interned. Students have also worked at leading fashion funders, nonprofits, law firms with fashion practices, and other organizations connected to the industry.



A number of these students have been placed through our Fashion Law Practicum drafting course, in which students receive academic credit for internships supervised by our faculty. Students have also secured internships independently with the help of our extensive industry connections. Internships come in all spaces and sizes, and we encourage students to remember that any internship has the potential to turn into a job.

A note regarding course selection for part time students

The LL.M. program strives to ensure that there is a wide range of courses available in the evening in each of our LL.M. areas of specialization, and to ensure that students will be able to meet their program requirements within their desired time frame for completion.

However, it would be impossible to ensure that any specific course will be offered at a time that is convenient to all students. We encourage you to look at the schedules from past semesters, available on the [registrar's website](https://myweb.lawnet.fordham.edu/sites/classschedules/SitePages/Home.aspx), to get a sense of what courses may be offered in the future (noting, of course, that the schedule varies from one semester to the next).

Should you find at any time that you are having trouble meeting your program requirements within your desired time frame, you should contact Anthony Agolia at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#caababada5a6a3ab8aa6abbde4aca5b8aea2aba7e4afaebf) to discuss options.
