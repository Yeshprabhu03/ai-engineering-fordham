# International Business and Trade Law

The LLM program in International Business and Trade Law prepares students to meet the challenges of an increasingly global economy by giving them the knowledge and training needed to handle complex transnational transactions that define the current legal and business environment. This program includes core courses in European Union Law, International Law, International Business Transactions, and International Trade Regulation, as well as a range of elective courses in such subjects as Admiralty and International Maritime Law, U.S. Contract Law, International Arbitration, and Cross-Border Mergers and Acquisitions. Students may also choose courses from an evolving curriculum that reflects current global economic power players with courses such as Islamic Finance and Estate Planning and China and International Law.

All LL.M. students who do not hold a J.D. from a U.S. law school are additionally required to take the following courses:

Students are required to take Introduction to the U.S. Legal System and Process and Legal Writing and Research for LLM Students during their first semester of study in the LLM program.

A note regarding course selection for part time students

The LL.M. program strives to ensure that there is a wide range of courses available in the evening in each of our LL.M. areas of specialization, and to ensure that students will be able to meet their program requirements within their desired time frame for completion.

However, it would be impossible to ensure that any specific course will be offered at a time that is convenient to all students. We encourage you to look at the schedules from past semesters, available on the [registrar's website](https://myweb.lawnet.fordham.edu/sites/classschedules/SitePages/Home.aspx), to get a sense of what courses may be offered in the future (noting, of course, that the schedule varies from one semester to the next).

Should you find at any time that you are having trouble meeting your program requirements within your desired time frame, you should contact Anthony Agolia at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#dbbababcb4b7b2ba9bb7baacf5bdb4a9bfb3bab6f5bebfae) to discuss options.
