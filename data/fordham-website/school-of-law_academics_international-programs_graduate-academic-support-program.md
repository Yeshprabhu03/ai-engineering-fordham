The Academic Enrichment Program comprises a series of seminars designed to help graduate students succeed in their studies. It covers a wide variety of topics, including case analysis, outlining, exam preparation, and scholarly writing. The first sessions of the Academic Enrichment Program take place each semester during Orientation; thereafter, sessions are offered periodically throughout the semester. Academic Enrichment seminars are required for first-semester exchange students, M.S.L. students, and LL.M. students who do not hold a J.D. from a U.S. law school. Students may view the International and Graduate Student eNewsletter to see the dates of these sessions. Questions regarding the Academic Enrichment Program should be directed to Anthony Agolia,
