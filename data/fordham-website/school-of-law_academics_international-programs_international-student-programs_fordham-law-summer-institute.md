### Who Can Register

The Summer Institute is open to international law students and graduates with an interest in U.S. law. There are no specific academic requirements in order to register for this program. All courses will be conducted in English, but we do not require any language assessment scores.

Many students who are coming to the United States for an LLM degree find this program helpful as an introduction to U.S. law prior to their master's studies. Each year we also welcome many other international law students, graduates, and practitioners who are interested in U.S. law.

### When to Register

The deadline for registration and full payment is approximately one month before the program's start. However, space in the program is limited and early registration is encouraged. We expect this program to fill before the registration deadline. Participants are accepted to the program in the order in which complete registrations, including the deposit, are received.

**Fordham Housing**Fordham has offered a limited number of single rooms in SHARED suite apartments on or near campus for the Summer Institute. Students are also welcome to secure accommodations independently, off campus. The below information is provided for reference only and may change in future years.

Fordham housing generally provides each occupant with the following:

- Twin bed
- Dresser
- Closet
- Sheets, blankets, pillows, and towel

In suite-style residences, four single rooms share a bathroom and living room, and a kitchen supplied with cabinets and stove. Please note that kitchens do not come equipped with cooking equipment, dishes, or utensils.

Additional amenities provided with Fordham housing have historically included:

- 24 hour security
- Laundry facilities
- Wireless internet access
- Air Conditioning
- Linens changed weekly

*Students who intend to secure accommodations independently are reminded to exercise caution when making arrangements. International students trying to secure housing while abroad are particularly prone to fraud. Avoid any arrangement that requires a wire transfer before arrival.

**Accommodations for Incoming LLM Students**Students who will attend the Summer Institute immediately prior to attending the LLM at Fordham may be able to apply for early student housing on or near campus. Students can consult with the

[Office of Residential Life](/student-life/living-on-campus/living-on-campus-at-lincoln-center/)for additional information on housing for the academic year.**Immunization Requirement**Pursuant to New York State Public Health Law Section 2165, all participants living in Fordham accommodations born on or after January 1, 1957, must have on file proof of immunity from measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR).

[WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccinations](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines/advice)are strongly recommended.Any queries regarding immunization should be addressed to Maureen Keown, Director of the Fordham Health Center, at

[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d7babcb2b8a0b997b1b8a5b3bfb6baf9b2b3a2). -
**Choosing a Visa**The University's Office for International Services (OIS) will process all visa paperwork for Summer Institute participants.

Fordham does not require any specific visa type to attend the Summer Institute, but we do offer guidance to enable you to make a prudent choice customized for your personal case.

Most program participants enter the U.S. as a B-1, B-2, or WT visitor. This is appropriate for those who are "coming to the United States primarily for tourism," and "also incidentally will engage in a short course of study during their visit." It cannot be used by participants who will be staying in the U.S. to pursue a degree-granting program after the Summer Institute. Therefore, if you choose the B-2/WT visa, you are entering the U.S. with "tourist" intentions, which is your primary purpose. Your "study" at Fordham in the Summer Institute is your secondary purpose. It is "incidental and avocational" to your primary tourist purpose.

Fordham University issues 1-20s to support F-1 visa applications for our Summer Institute. If you wish to pursue the F-1 option, you should follow all instructions on this webpage.

**Obtaining an F-1 Visa**The Summer Institute satisfies the F-1 visa/status requirements. Upon submission of the required documentation (see below), Fordham University will issue an I-20 which will enable participants to obtain an F-1 visa to enter the United States for the purpose of participating in our Summer Institute.

If a participant wishes to obtain an F-1 visa, the below documents must be submitted directly to the Office for International Services by email at**Do not submit any information to the OIS until you have paid the $500 program deposit.**[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d8b7b1abb6bdafabacadbcbdb6ac98beb7aabcb0b9b5f6bdbcade7abadbab2bdbbace59eb7aabcb0b9b5fdeae894b9affdeae88badb5b5bdaafdeae891b6abacb1acadacbdfdeae8eae8eaeb).- AFCOE form according to housing type (this form will available online closer to the start of the program);
- Financial supporting statement, such as an official bank statement, bank or employer letter showing sufficient funds, or copies of award letters, loans, etc.;
- A statement indicating whether the participant intends to pursue an academic program in the U.S. before or after the Summer Institute; and
- A copy of the name and picture pages of the passport clearly showing the participant's full name and photograph.

LLM program AFCOE forms are available via the OIS website.

In order to expedite your I-20 processing, please submit the AFCOE forms for both programs together, if possible.

**Visa Check-In at Arrival**Most of the mandatory check-in process is handled via the online portal accessible at www.fordham.edu/ois with instructions provided via email by OIS. Further information regarding visa regulations will be provided on the first day of the program. Summer Institute students holding a Fordham-sponsored visa should bring their I-20 form, passport, and I-94 card with them on the first day.

For participants who will continue on to the LLM program in the fall, please indicate that you are incoming LLM student when you communicate with the OIS. OIS will email contact you when your LLM I-20 is issued.

Further questions regarding visa issues should be directed to

[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a9c6c0dac7ccdedadddccdccc7dde9cfc6dbcdc1c8c487cccddc).**Health Insurance**Fordham Law strongly recommends that all Summer Institute participants arrange for health insurance coverage for their time in the United States. Participants are encouraged to check with their current provider to see if coverage extends to their stay in New York.

Participants who are not covered are strongly urged to purchase insurance. Please note that participants are not automatically covered by Fordham University's health insurance, and may be held liable for any emergency medical expenses they incur during their time in the United States. The 2024 cost was $206 per student, and should be expected to increase for 2025. Please direct any inquiries regarding participant medical insurance to

The schedule of fees for the 2025 Fordham Law Summer Institute is below:

**Program Fee:**$3,250**Program with single-occupancy housing on Fordham's campus:**$6,000

Fee includes tuition and course materials. -
The Thiago Barbarisi Moraes Memorial Scholarship is established in memory of Thiago, a participant in the First Annual Fordham Law Summer Institute in NYC. Thiago, a much beloved member of the Fordham Law family, died tragically on June 7, 2008, in Sao Paolo.

What we will always remember and treasure about Thiago was his wonderful, warm, and loving nature. He was unfailingly friendly, he was kind to all, he was gentle and sensitive, and he was a natural leader. Thiago enriched forever the lives of those who knew him, and he left us far too soon.

The scholarship that has been created in Thiago’s memory is awarded to the law student or young lawyer from Brazil who best exemplifies the qualities that we loved about and admired in Thiago. The scholarship covers the full cost of the Summer Institute.
