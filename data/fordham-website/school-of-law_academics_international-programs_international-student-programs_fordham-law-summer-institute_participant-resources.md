# Summer Institute Participant Resources

## Welcome to the Eighteenth Annual Fordham Law Summer Institute!

The Participant Resources webpage contains a range of information to help you prepare for this program and your stay in New York City.

The Summer Institute has been designed to give you an overview of the U.S. legal system and some of the most important areas of substantive law for global lawyers today. As you will see from the program schedule, the tentative version of which is available below, you will be learning from some of the country’s leading legal academics and practitioners.

New York is a wonderful city, and we encourage you to take full advantage of the social and cultural activities that are available here. We stand ready to help ensure that your visit will be an outstanding professional and personal experience – one that you will remember forever.

This page will be updated leading up to the 2025 program, so check back frequently and look for email communications from our office with important information!

Attendance Policy

Attendance will be taken at the start of each class. Participants who fail to attend at least 80% of program classes will not receive a program certificate. The attendance sheet will be removed once the session begins, and students who arrive late for class will not be counted as in attendance. Accordingly, please arrive at least ten minutes before the start of each session. Please note that program sessions marked as "optional" are not included in this attendance policy.

Students who leave a class before it ends will be marked absent for that class.

Academic Credit

Fordham Law does not award academic credit for this program. However, we are happy to coordinate with participants in order to help them receive academic credit from their home institutions. These participants will be given a graded evaluation based on a take-home exam that will be given at the end of the program.

Participants who require this evaluation must

Housing for the 2025 Summer Institute is shared suite-style apartments, with single-occupancy bedrooms. Common areas and bathrooms are shared spaces in all accommodations. Please see below for more details.

-
Fordham will provide linens, pillows, and towels for your use.

**Although there is a kitchen in these apartments, they do not come equipped with dishes, utensils, or cooking equipment.**McMahon Hall has three laundry rooms available for use by program participants. There is no charge for use of the washers and dryers, but participants must provide their own detergent. Rooms will be cleaned professionally before and after the participant’s stay, but not during.

-
Fordham housing facilities have 24-hour security. You are required to show your Fordham identification card each time you enter a housing facility or any other Fordham campus building, including the Law School.

Participants will check in at McMahon Hall the day before the program begins.

**Other summer groups will be checking in simultaneously; participants should expect to encounter delays at check-in.**A Fordham staff member will greet participants between 9:00 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. with keys and ID cards. The security guard on staff will greet those who arrive outside of these hours. Students must depart from the housing on or by 10:00 a.m. the morning after the program concludes. Students may leave keys with the security guard on staff. Please note that there will be a charge for lost or stolen keys, so please keep your key in a safe place.Fordham University hosts a variety of groups throughout the summer that are very tightly scheduled.

**It will not be possible for any Summer Institute participant to check in or check out other than the designated days under any circumstances.**If you would like to extend your stay in New York before or after the program, you should secure alternate accommodations before your arrival in New York. -
Any rules or processes governing receiving mail at Fordham accommodations will be published closer to the start of the program. Students staying in on-campus housing will also receive instructions from the Office of Residential Life.

-
As a participant in the Summer Institute, you are subject to all University housing and other rules and regulations. Failure to adhere to these guidelines may result in your ejection from University housing and the Summer Institute program. We will review these rules and regulations on the first day of the program, and the Office of Residential Life will provide information at move in.

All participants will receive an ID for access to Fordham’s campus. It is important to keep this ID card with you at all times. Lost ID cards must be replaced for a fee of $25.00 at the student's expense.

Participants should be advised that New York City has very strict anti-smoking laws. It is illegal to smoke in public buildings, public parks, the student dormitory, on beaches and boardwalks, and where marked. Smoking is also illegal throughout the subway and bus system, even on outdoor train platforms.


## Visas and Health Insurance

Fordham does not require any specific visa type to attend the Summer Institute, but we do offer guidance to enable you to make a prudent choice customized for your personal case. We also strongly recommend that participants check with their current health insurance provider to determine if their coverage extends to their stay in New York, and that they purchase supplemental coverage if it does not. Additional details are provided below.

-
The University's Office for International Services (OIS) will process all visa paperwork for Summer Institute participants. You can contact OIS via email at

[[email protected],](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9ef1f7edf0fbe9edeaebfafbf0eadef8f1ecfaf6fff3b0fbfaebb2)which is their preferred method of communication.**Please do not contact OIS with paperwork or questions until you have submitted the $500 deposit to hold your place in the Summer Institute program.**Fordham does not require any specific visa type to attend the Summer Institute, but we do offer guidance to enable you to make a prudent choice customized for your personal case.

Most program participants enter the U.S. as a B-1, B-2, or WT visitor. This is appropriate for those who are "coming to the United States primarily for tourism," and "also incidentally will engage in a short course of study during their visit." It cannot be used by participants who will be staying in the U.S. to pursue a degree-granting program after the Summer Institute. Therefore, if you choose the B-2/WT visa, you are entering the U.S. with "tourist" intentions, which is your primary purpose. Your "study" at Fordham in the Summer Institute is your secondary purpose. It is "incidental and avocational" to your primary tourist purpose.

Fordham University issues I-20s to support F-1 visa applications for our Summer Institute. If you wish to pursue the F-1 option, you should follow all instructions on this webpage.

## Obtaining an F-1 Visa

The Summer Institute satisfies the F-1 visa/status requirements. Upon submission of the required documentation (see below), Fordham University will issue an I-20 which will enable participants to obtain an F-1 visa to enter the United States for the purpose of participating in our Summer Institute. If a participant wishes to obtain an F-1 visa, please review the below required documents that must be submitted directly to the Office for International Services by email

**only after you have submitted your program deposit**:- AFCOE form according to housing type

And the below supplemental documents, as needed, listed on the AFCOE form:

- Financial supporting statement, such as an official bank statement, bank or employer letter showing sufficient funds, or copies of award letters, loans, etc.;
- A statement indicating whether the participant intends to pursue an academic program in the U.S. before or after the Summer Institute; and
- A copy of the name and picture pages of the passport clearly showing the participant's full name and photograph.

## Special Instructions for Incoming Fordham Law LLM Students

If you will attend the Summer Institute program prior to the LLM program, you will need to submit AFCOE forms for BOTH programs. LLM program AFCOE forms are available via the OIS website.

In order to expedite your I-20 processing, please submit the AFCOE forms for both programs together, if possible.

## First-Day Check In

Federal regulations require all non-immigrants attending the Summer Institute on visas sponsored by Fordham to check-in with the Office for International Services (OIS). Most of the check-in process is handled via the online portal accessible at www.fordham.edu/ois with instructions provided via email by OIS. Further information regarding visa regulations will be provided on the first day of the program. Summer Institute students holding a Fordham-sponsored visa should bring their I-20 form, passport, and I-94 card with them on the first day.

-
Fordham Law strongly recommends that all Summer Institute participants arrange for health insurance coverage for their time in the United States. Participants are encouraged to check with their current provider to see if coverage extends to their stay in New York.

Participants who are not covered are strongly urged to purchase insurance. Participants are not automatically covered by Fordham University's health insurance, and may be held liable for any emergency medical expenses they incur during their time in the United States.

International participants are invited to purchase basic health insurance coverage offered via Fordham University. The plan available to Summer Institute participants covers the duration of the program. The 2025 cost is $248.82 per student, with additional charges for a spouse and/or children. Students should enroll at

[aetnastudenthelath.com](http://aetnastudenthelath.com). Any issues, questions, or inquiries regarding insurance should be sent via email to[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6c1f18190809021805021f191e0d020f092c0a031e08040d0142090819).**Coverage is only available to international, or "non-immigrant" students. This coverage is not available to U.S. citizens, resident aliens, or permanent residents.**

## Important NYC Pre-Program Information

-
Clothing

There is no dress code for classes held at Fordham Law. Students should bring at least one or two business outfits for visits that are part of the program. For those visits, dress conservatively (no sneakers, jeans, or t-shirts; women should not wear low-cut blouses or short skirts). Many people like to dress festively for the Closing Luncheon.

New York City may be hot and humid in July, but most places are air-conditioned, and some heavily so, particularly within the Law School. It is advisable to dress in layers, and to always have a sweater, jacket, or long-sleeved shirt on hand.

It can rain heavily in July in New York so you may want to bring an umbrella, or purchase one while you are here. It is absolutely essential that you also have a pair of comfortable walking shoes!

Computers

Students may want to bring laptop computers with them but this is not required. Wireless access will be available in the Law School and in program housing for students who do bring a laptop with them.

All program materials will be provided in digital form; printed copies will not be made available. Fordham Law students will be using the library to study for the New York Bar Exam at this time and Summer Institute students should not use the Library unless absolutely necessary.

Traveling the New York City Subway System

The most common way to enter the subway is by using contactless payment (e.g., Apple Pay or a tap-enabled credit card) or the

[OMNY app](https://omny.info)at the turnstile. The charge for each ride, regardless of the length, is $2.90. Non-express buses also cost $2.90 per ride, and there is no cost for a transfer from a bus to a subway, or subway to bus. If you pay for 12 rides using the same device or card in a week, additional rides within that week are free.MTA services that extend outside of the city, such as the Metro North Railroad, have different fare structures.

[View MTA fares online.](https://new.mta.info/fares)You may also purchase a MetroCard to enter and travel the subway. The charge for a new card is $1.00. There is a flat fare for every subway ride, no matter how short or long your trip may be. The fare for a single ride is $2.90, but purchasing a SingleRide ticket is $3.25 (the $1.00 MetroCard fee does not apply to SingleRide tickets). You can save money by purchasing several rides in advance. For $34, the 7-day Unlimited Ride MetroCard will allow you to make unlimited trips for 7 days from your first use. There is no charge when you use your MetroCard to transfer from a bus to a subway, or subway to bus.

New York City is served by at least two international airports – John. F. Kennedy (JFK) and Newark Liberty (EWR). From either airport, you can take a taxi, train, or bus to reach Manhattan.

The program housing is located at 155 West 60 Street, between Columbus Avenue and Amsterdam Avenue. Program classes will take place in the Law School building, 150 West 62 Street, between Columbus Avenue and Amsterdam Avenue.

Participants should be advised that Fordham University has two campuses in New York City. Fordham Law School and the Summer Institute program housing are located on the Lincoln Center Campus on Columbus Avenue in Manhattan. No program activities will take place at the main university campus, which is in the Bronx section of New York City. Participants should make this distinction when advising taxi drivers of their final destination.

**Participants should ignore offers of transportation from solicitors in the terminal. Go to ground transportation information counters, bus stops, and taxi dispatchers for safe and legitimate transportation. Ignore non-uniformed people offering to assist with baggage.** -
From John F. Kennedy (JFK) International Airport

By Taxi

Upon leaving the arrival area of the airport, look for the taxi queue. For trips to Manhattan from JFK International Airport, there is a flat fee of $70 (plus tax), not including tolls or tip. Rates will be higher from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. on weekdays. It is customary to tip 15-20% for good service. You may be charged a toll depending on the route your driver takes. Generally, the only applicable tolls for a trip from JFK International Airport to Fordham Law School would be a $6.55 toll for using the Hugh L. Carey Brooklyn Battery or Queens Midtown tunnels. Up to four riders can take a taxi together.

By NY Airport Bus Service

NY Airport Service operates shuttle vehicles between JFK and Manhattan. The fare is approximately $50 one-way for a shared shuttle from JFK to Manhattan. Bus stops are located outside the baggage claim area at every terminal. The trip generally lasts 45-60 minutes and there are several stops in Manhattan. Participants should exit at Port Authority Bus Terminal (Eighth Avenue and West 42 Street). From there, it is a short taxi or subway ride to Fordham Law School.

[Get more information on the NY Airport Shuttle](https://www.goairlinkshuttle.com/nyc-jfk-airport-share-ride-shuttle/).By Train

Train travel from JFK Airport to Manhattan is generally the cheapest option; however, it is also the most time consuming. Participants should take the AirTrain to the Long Island Railroad (LIRR) at Jamaica Station, then take the LIRR to Penn Station. The one-way cost for travel from JFK to Penn Station is between $15.75 and $18.75, depending on the time of day. (Paying for fares onboard the LIRR is significantly more expensive.) From there, it is a short taxi or subway ride to Fordham Law School. If you are taking the subway, take the A/C train to 59 Street – Columbus Circle.
