# Dean Acheson Legal Scholar Program

The [Dean Acheson Legal Scholar Program](https://lu.usembassy.gov/applications-invited-to-dean-acheson-legal-scholar-program/) at the Court of Justice of the European Union (European Court of Justice), organized through the U.S. Embassy in Luxembourg, offers traineeship/internship opportunities at the Court of Justice and the General Court to a limited number of recent graduates from select U.S. law schools. Students are nominated to the Court by their law schools, and the Court makes the final selection decision. Fordham Law alumni and are eligible to apply for these opportunities, which last no more than three months and enable them to work in the chambers of a judge or advocate general of the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. The work environment is collegial, as clerks of all chambers spend a good deal of time together within and outside the Court of Justice.

## Dates

There are two possible Dean Acheson Legal Scholar periods:

Fall Term (mid-September to mid-December)

Spring Term (mid-February to mid-May)

**Due to residency requirements, candidates must have completed law school prior to the term for which they are seeking admission to the program.**

Some flexibility regarding dates may be possible at the discretion of the Judge or Advocate General to whom the Dean Acheson scholar is attached. Exact dates will be determined by the calendar of the Court. The maximum participation period is three months due to Luxembourg visa requirements for non EU citizens.

### Categories of Dean Acheson Legal Scholar Program

Three types of opportunities are available:

**With a Judge of the Court of Justice**

The Dean Acheson scholar works in the chambers of a judge of the Court of Justice in association with his or her referendaires (law clerks). The scholar is expected to assist the judge and his or her referendaires as required. This experience offers an unparalleled opportunity to gain insight into a judicial process characteristic of the European Court, but very different from the American approach, involving a high degree of intellectual teamwork. A good knowledge of French is desirable.

**With an Advocate General of the Court of Justice**

The Dean Acheson scholar works in the Chambers of an Advocate General of the Court of Justice in association with his or her referendaires. The scholar takes part in the research and writing of the Advocate General's opinions, an experience most akin to a traditional U.S. judicial clerking experience. Advocates General prepare their opinions in their native language. The scholar, therefore, needs to have the language skills appropriate to the Advocate General who selects him or her. A good knowledge of French is desirable.

**With a Judge of the General Court**

The Dean Acheson scholar works in the Chambers of a Judge of the General Court in association with their referendaires (law clerks). The visitor is expected to assist the Judge and their referendaires as needed. The tasks are varied and include case law research, scholarly writings analysis, brief production and issue discussions. The cases mainly concern applications by legal or natural persons against EU actions or inactions. A good knowledge of French is desirable.

#### Eligibility requirements

The purpose of the Dean Acheson Legal Scholar Program is to promote mutual understanding between the peoples of the United States and the European Union in the context of the legal profession. It is therefore open to American citizens and legal permanent residents only. Applicants must have completed three years of law school by the term for which they are seeking admission, and preference will be given to those who have a strong knowledge of Community Law. As noted above, in view of the nature of the working environment, a good knowledge of French is desirable; and the knowledge of an EU language other than French and English is an advantage.
