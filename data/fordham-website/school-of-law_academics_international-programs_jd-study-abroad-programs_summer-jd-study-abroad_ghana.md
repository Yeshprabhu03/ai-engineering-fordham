This exciting opportunity is the only foreign law program accredited by the American Bar Association located in Ghana. Each summer, we admit up to 30 students, allowing students to earn a maximum of 8 credits. **The structure of our program allows students to design their own experience by building on the required 3-credit course.**

: Students will select one of two 3-credit courses that will take place over two weeks of classroom instruction. All participating students enroll in the required 3-credit course.**Main Course**: Students can elect to take an additional 2-credit course on Critical Race Theory.**Extension Program**

Who Should Apply

Any students attending an ABA-accredited law school who has a desire to visit Ghana and explore topics of comparative law.

The program has enrolled over 200 students from over 30 law schools since its inception in 2009. The program also enrolls at least fifteen Ghanaian law students each year.

## Application Due Date

**Due date for submission is March 1, 2026.**

The final due date to apply for both the academic session and optional internship program is March 1, 2026, after which participants will only be admitted if space is available; however, some classes and internship placements fill up early, so applicants with a strong preference are encouraged to apply as early as possible.

This program is accredited by the American Bar Association. Fordham's academic rules and regulations will apply for awarding academic credit. Fordham uses an "A-F" grading system. Daily attendance and preparation for classes are required and may be taken into account in determining the course grade. The for-credit internship is pass/fail; however, taking academic session courses for pass/fail is not permissible. The for-credit internship is pass/fail; however, taking academic session courses for pass/fail is not permissible.

Students are permitted to enroll in a maximum of six credits (One 3-credit course + One 3-credit internship) during the program. Acceptance of any credit or grade for any course is subject to determination by the student's home institution. All classes and the for-credit internship qualify for three academic semester credit hours towards the JD or LLM degree at Fordham. Fordham Law Evening Division students who are planning to transfer to the full-time day division are eligible to participate but must consult the Registrar regarding residency requirements.

Non-Fordham Law students should consult their law school's registrar to verify that the Fordham course and internship may be credited toward their degree. Students should also consult their registrar with respect to the ABA residency requirement. It is unlikely that participation in this program will accelerate graduation.

Summer grades are generally available by late August; transcript requests are free of charge and should be addressed to the Fordham Law Office of the Registrar.

The Ghana Summer Program reserves the right to alter or cancel its programs. Cancellation would occur in the event of under-enrollment by May 1, 2026, or unforeseen international events that could inhibit program operations or seriously affect participants' safety.

In the unlikely event that the program is canceled, students will be notified immediately via telephone and email; the refunds of the otherwise non-refundable application fee and all other payments will be requested within 20 days of cancellation; and Fordham will use its best efforts to make alternative arrangements for any enrolled student to attend a similar program, if desired.

If the program were to be modified substantially, students affected by the modifications would be entitled to a refund upon request.
