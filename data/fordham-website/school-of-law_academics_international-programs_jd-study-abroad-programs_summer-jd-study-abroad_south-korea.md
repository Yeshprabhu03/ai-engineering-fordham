Fordham Law School and Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU) College of Law in Seoul are pleased to co-sponsor the annual Summer Program in Seoul, a two-week academic program (3 credits) to be followed by an optional one-week academic program (2 credits) or optional internships lasting 2 to 4 weeks (credit or no credit).

The program, which is held in [central](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/12/15/travel/things-to-do-seoul.html) [Seoul](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/31/travel/seoul-local-travel-guide.html) in the lush, [mountainside](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/19/travel/seoul-city-wall.html) campus of SKKU, is open to anyone who is seeking law school credits from an ABA-approved law school. In its seventeen years, the Institute enrolled over 1200 students from 10 countries and 70 law schools, including law students from American University, Arizona State, Boston College, Boston University, Chicago-Kent, Columbia, Cornell, Duke, Emory, George Washington, Gonzaga, University of Hawaii, University of Illinois, Loyola-LA, McGill, NYU, Northwestern, Southern Methodist, Texas, Tulane, UC-Berkeley, UCLA, University of Pennsylvania, USC, University of San Diego, University of South Carolina, and William & Mary Law School.

All participating students enroll in one 3-credit course on offer, taught by a member of the Fordham Law Faculty. The course will run from Monday, June 15 to Friday, June 26. Afterwards, participating students have the option of earning additional law school credits by enrolling in a 2-credit course, taught by a member of the Fordham Law Faculty, from Monday, June 29 to Friday, July 3. (These dates are tentative; exact dates are still to be confirmed.) Therefore, students will have the option of acquiring 5 law school credits in three weeks of coursework in Seoul. Classroom instruction is supplemented by field trips to legal institutions and cultural sites.

Participating students also have the option of being placed in internships with legal employers either for credit or for no credit, but there is a limited number of internships and internships are not guaranteed.
