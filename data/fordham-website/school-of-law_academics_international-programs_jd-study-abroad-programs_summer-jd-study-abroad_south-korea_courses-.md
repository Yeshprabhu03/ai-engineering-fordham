## Course Offering

International White Collar Crime (June 15, 2026-June 26, 2026)

In this course, we will study criminal laws that regulate cross-border or overseas conduct especially those that take the form of business transactions, such as bribery, export controls, arms and drug trafficking, money laundering, securities fraud, and antitrust violations; the principles of jurisdiction that may be used to prescribe, adjudicate and enforce these crimes; enforcement mechanisms of these crimes (including transnational prosecutions); and the logistical and procedural challenges involved in the prosecution of these crimes. Criminal law is not a prerequisite. (Note for Fordham evening students: This course may be taken concurrently with Professor Lee’s Criminal Law class in the Summer Term.)


Comparative Criminal Law and Dispute Resolution (June 29, 2026-July 3, 2026)

How should we think about the future of the criminal justice system in the United States? This class approaches this question by examining the role of criminal law as means of resolving disputes in Korea, but with references to other countries’ legal systems, including that of Germany, Japan, and France. The class will focus in particular on the role of various actors in the criminal justice system: complainants, defendants, prosecutors, defense lawyers, and judges and jurors. The final exam will be a take-home essay question. Criminal law is not a prerequisite. (Note for Fordham evening students: This course may be taken concurrently with Professor Lee’s Criminal Law class in the Summer Term.)
