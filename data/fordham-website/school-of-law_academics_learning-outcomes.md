# Learning Outcomes

Through committed teaching and influential scholarship in a community characterized by diversity, intellectual rigor, and collegiality, the law school aims to enhance understanding of law, advance the public good, and help its students obtain the professional values, knowledge, and skills they need to become excellent lawyers in the service of others. Part of a Jesuit university, Fordham Law School integrates intellectual growth with a commitment to justice and equality, and teaches that the privilege of practicing law carries concomitant moral responsibilities.
