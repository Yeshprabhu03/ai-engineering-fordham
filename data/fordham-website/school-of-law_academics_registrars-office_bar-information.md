New York Law Course and New York Law Exam

In conjunction with the adoption of the Uniform Bar Examination (UBE) in New York, the State Board of Law Examiners was directed by the Court of Appeals to create an on-line course, known as the New York Law Course (NYLC), and an on-line, open book exam on New York specific law, known as the New York Law Exam (NYLE).

As with the MPRE discussed above, a candidate seeking admission in New York must take and pass the NYLC, the NYLE, and earn a passing score on New York’s UBE, prior to being certified to one of our Appellate Division departments for a character and fitness investigation. The NYLE is offered four times a year. [Read more information on course materials and sample questions](https://www.nybarexam.org/Content/CourseMaterials.htm).
