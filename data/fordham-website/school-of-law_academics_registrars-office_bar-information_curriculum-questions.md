# Curriculum Questions on Bar Exam Application

## Instructions for Juris Doctor Applicants Completing Curriculum Questions on Bar Exam Application

During the New York State bar exam application process (Oct 1 – 31 for the February exam or March 1 – 31 for the July exam), you will be guided to answer curriculum questions. Your answers to the questions will be used by the NYSBOLE to generate a Certificate of Attendance form which will be uploaded to an electronic portal shared between Fordham Law School and the NYSBOLE.

The law school will compare your COA answers with our records and we will make any necessary corrections to the form. We will then certify the form’s accuracy and submit the verified COA via the portal. Completed COAs must be received via the portal by **January 15th** for the **February examination** or **June 15th** for the **July** examination. The Court Rules referred to on the bar exam application and on the Certificate of Attendance form that will be generated, may be found on the [Board’s website](https://www.nybarexam.org/).
