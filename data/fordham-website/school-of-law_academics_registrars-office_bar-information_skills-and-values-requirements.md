# New York State Skills and Values Requirements

## Learn about Pathways

In December 2015, the Court of Appeals adopted a [Skills and Values Requirement](https://www.nybarexam.org/Skills/skills.htm) ("Skills Requirement") for admission to the bar in New York, which is in effect for J.D. students who commenced their law school studies in August 2016 or later and LL.M. students who commenced their studies in August 2018 or later.

This Skills Requirement offers applicants a choice among five different "Pathways" to establish that they have acquired the skills and are familiar with the professional values necessary to practice law competently. These Pathways represent requirements for admission solely to the New York bar; they are not additional requirements for a Fordham legal education.

Three Pathways are relevant to your law school study:

-
Pathway 1 is satisfied by completing

[Fundamental Lawyering Skills](https://www.fordham.edu/school-of-law/experiential-education/lawyering-skills/fundamental-lawyering-skills/)and your graduation requirements.[Fundamental Lawyering Skills](https://www.fordham.edu/school-of-law/experiential-education/lawyering-skills/fundamental-lawyering-skills/)also satisfies three of six experiential course credits required for graduation. -
The Law School's Certification of its LL.M. Graduates for Satisfying Pathway 1 of the New York State Bar's Skills and Values Requirement

LL.M. students commencing study after August 1, 2018 who plan to apply for admission to the New York State Bar must satisfy one of five pathways under Section 520.18 of the Court of Appeal's Rules for the Admission of Attorneys and Counselors at Law regarding skills competency and professional values. (The section is attached below.)

(e) At least two credits of a professional responsibility-focused course.

*Courses that the Law School has designated as Experiential meet all of the requirements of the American Bar Association Standards and Rules of Procedure for the Approval of Law Schools Standard 303(a)(3).

§520.18 Skills Competency Requirement for Admission.

(a) General. Every applicant for admission to practice, other than applicants for admission without examination pursuant to section 520.10 of this Part, or applicants who qualify for the bar examination under section 520.4 or 520.5 of this Part, shall demonstrate that the applicant possesses the skills and values necessary to provide effective, ethical and responsible legal services in this State.An applicant may satisfy this requirement by submitting proof of compliance with one of the following five subdivisions.


(1) Law school certification of competence in skills and professional values.(i) An applicant may submit from an American Bar Association-approved law school a certification confirming that:

(a) the law school has developed a plan identifying and incorporating into its curriculum the skills and professional values that, in the school's judgment, are required for its graduates' basic competence and ethical participation in the legal profession, as required by American Bar Association Standards and Rules of Procedure for the Approval of Law Schools Standard 302(b), (c) and (d), and has made this plan publicly available on the law school's website; and (b) the applicant has acquired sufficient competency in those skills and sufficient familiarity with those values.

(ii) For purposes of this subdivision, a school may certify that an applicant has attained the required skill level if the graduate received a grade that the school considers sufficient to demonstrate competence in courses the school has designated as teaching the skills and professional values needed for basic competence and ethical participation in the legal profession.

(iii) A law school may adopt such other means of assessing its students' achievement of the required skills for purposes of this subdivision, provided the school receives the prior approval of the Court of Appeals.

(2) Law school certification of credit acquisition. An applicant may submit a certification from the applicant's approved law school confirming that the applicant enrolled in and successfully completed 15 credit hours, as defined by American Bar Association Standards for the Approval of Law Schools, of practice-based experiential coursework designed to foster the development of professional competencies.

The 15 credits may be earned in whole or half credits.

(a) Develops the concepts underlying the practice competencies being taught;

(b) Provides opportunities for performance by the student other than traditional classroom discussion;

(c) Provides for regular individualized student feedback from a faculty member; and

(d) Provides opportunities for student self-reflection.

In countries, territories or commonwealths that permit the practice of law without formal admission, supervision by a law graduate who has not been formally admitted to the bar may suffice as long as the supervisor is authorized to engage in the relevant practice under the jurisdiction's rules, is in full compliance with the jurisdiction's rules, and has had at least two years of experience in the relevant practice.

(i)

**Timing.**The apprenticeship shall be continuous for the six-month period, and shall commence after the conclusion of the applicant's law studies, except that an applicant who is required to complete an LL.M. program at an approved law school pursuant to section 520.6(b) of this Part may complete the apprenticeship before commencing the LL.M. program.

- Providing the applicant with experience and guidance in the skills and values required for basic competence and ethical participation in the legal profession;
- Giving timely oral and written feedback to the applicant;
- Engaging the applicant in reflection on his/her experiences and learning during the apprenticeship;

Prior legal practice may qualify even if it occurred without formal admission to the bar if the applicant engaged in lawful practice in a country, territory or commonwealth that permits legal practice without formal admission to the bar, and if the prior practice was for at least one year or half-time for two years, in full compliance with the jurisdiction's rules.

For an applicant who qualifies for the bar exam after completion of an LL.M. degree pursuant to section 520.6 of this Part, the applicant's practice may occur before or after commencement of the LL.M. program.

(b) Proof required. An applicant shall submit to the appropriate Appellate Division department of Supreme Court an Affidavit of Compliance with the Skills Competency Requirement.
