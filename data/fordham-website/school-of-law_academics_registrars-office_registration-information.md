Distance-Learning (Online) Course Reminders

All students (LL.M. students who have obtained permission, J.D. students and M.S.L students) will be limited to one distance-based course per semester.

J.D. students may not register for a distance-based course until they have 28 earned credits at the start of the upcoming term. Moreover, students can apply no more than 15 credits of distance-based courses toward the J.D. degree.

**Note: **this rule was suspended between the spring of 2020 and the spring of 2022 (inclusive), and thus credits in distance-based courses taken anytime between the spring of 2020 through spring of 2022 do NOT count toward the 15 online credits maximum.

LL.M. students may not register for a distance-based course until they first obtain permission from Director Anthony Agolia ([[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)). Distance-based courses do not count toward New York bar eligibility requirements for foreign-trained LL.M. students.

Foreign-trained LL.M. students who will finish with at least 26 cumulative credits may be permitted to register for one online/hybrid course, provided that the course is not a professional responsibility course or a content outline course. Failure to follow these instructions could jeopardize your eligibility to sit for the New York bar examination.


Courses with Pre-/Co-Requisites

Students must obtain permission from the professor (via email) in order to waive any pre-/co-requisites requirements. Upon receiving approval, please forward the email containing the approval to the Registrar’s Office ([[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)).

Holds

Students who have any holds on their account will be prohibited from registering for courses until the hold is removed. Students can check for holds on the top right-hand corner of their Student Services Dashboard, under their Student page on Fordham.edu.

For any questions regarding financial matters, please contact our Financial Aid Service Office ([[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)).
