# Law School eTranscript FAQs

## Overview

-
The National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) is a nonprofit and nongovernmental organization. It is the leading provider of educational reporting, data exchange, verification, and research services. Higher education institutions across the country use the NSC for eTranscript processing services.

-
All Fordham University students and alumni who attended (completed all of their coursework) after 1990 are eligible to request an eTranscript.

-
If you still have access to the www.fordham.edu portal, go to your Student Tab, and look for a box titled “Official eTranscript Request and Enrollment Verification” and click the link in that box. You will then be taken to a National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) landing page where you can access the eTranscript request.

If you no longer have access (or never had access) to the www.fordham.edu portal, visit

## Transcript Content

-
When submitting your transcript request, you will be able to choose from two transcript types:

- Undergraduate/Graduate
- Law School

Undergraduate/Graduate transcripts include coursework from all undergraduate and graduate colleges/schools, including continuing education courses. Such transcripts do

**not**include Law School coursework.Law School transcripts do not include any undergraduate/graduate coursework (or non-law continuing education) but include all Law School coursework.

If you attended both the Law School and another Fordham college/school, and need a transcript of both your Law and non-Law coursework, you will need to submit separate requests (Undergraduate/Graduate and Law School). You can have both an Undergraduate/Graduate and Law School transcript sent as part of the same request. If you entered your request for Undergraduate/Graduate first, for example, you would then need to use the “Add Recipient” option to add a Law School transcript to your request (and indicate the proper recipient).

-
Degrees are awarded several times throughout the year, following the conclusion of the Spring, Summer, and Fall semesters. The exact time at which students’ transcripts will indicate the awarding of a degree can vary based on a number of circumstances, so recent graduates submitting a transcript request should

**always**check their unofficial transcript on www.fordham.edu (Student Tab > My Information > Student Records > Academic Transcript > Unofficial Grad/Undergrad Trans > Submit)**prior**to submitting an eTranscript request, to ensure their earned degree(s) has/have been updated. -
Students submitting an eTranscript request, who are looking to have their most recent grades recorded on it, should

**always**check their unofficial transcript on www.fordham.edu (Student Tab > My Information > Student Records > Academic Transcript > Unofficial Grad/Undergrad Trans > Submit)**prior**to submitting an eTranscript request, to ensure their grades have posted. Alternatively, you can select the “After Grades Are Posted” option (described below) to have your transcript sent automatically once all of your grades have been posted. -
Yes, if you are currently enrolled in coursework for a current or future semester at the time you submit your request, you can select the “After Grades Are Posted” option and the relevant semester under the question “When do you want your transcript processed?” If you select this option, the system will check on a regular basis for all of your grades in the semester specified to be posted. Once all grades in the specified semester have been posted, your request will be sent.


## eTranscript Security

-
To learn more about the numerous security features of eTranscripts, visit the

[National Student Clearinghouse’s website](https://www.studentclearinghouse.org/). -
The electronic PDF transcript is meant to act as an official transcript when sent directly to the intended recipient. Thus, it is crucial that you have the transcript sent directly to the intended recipient, whether an individual, organization, institution, etc. eTranscripts forwarded from one party to another are not deemed official.


## After You Submit

-
Provided that: (i) you have no holds on your record that prevent transcript release, (ii) the National Student Clearinghouse is able to match the identifying information you provided to your Fordham student record; (iii) you have

**not**uploaded any attachments; and (iv) no system maintenance periods are ongoing, your eTranscript should be sent to your recipients within 30-90 minutes. -
If you have holds on your record that prevent transcript release, you will not be permitted to submit a request. Follow the instructions that accompany the notification of the hold to resolve the issue.

If your request cannot be matched to your student record at the time of your order, further research will be needed by the Office of the Registrar to positively identify your student record. Such research will add approximately 2-3 business days to your request, and is only conducted during normal business hours when the University is open. If such research determines that your student record has a hold, you will receive an e-mail notification informing you of the needed action.

**Under no circumstance will a transcript be released if a student’s account has a hold that prevents transcript release.** -
The emailed download link is only available to recipients for 30 days from the date on the email. Thereafter, the link will expire, and a new request must be sent.

-
You can track the status of your order by going to

[https://tsorder.studentclearinghouse.org/TrackOrder](https://tsorder.studentclearinghouse.org/TrackOrder)and entering your order number and e-mail address. You will also receive several email confirmations, such as when your request has been received, when your transcript has been sent, and when your recipient has retrieved the transcript. Text message notifications are also available.

## Troubleshooting

-
If this occurs, your request will submit successfully, but will fail to process once it reaches the University. If you make such an error, please resubmit your request ith the proper transcript type, as the erroneous request will be cancelled.
