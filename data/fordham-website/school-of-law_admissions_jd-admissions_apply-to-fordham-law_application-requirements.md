## Your step-by-step guide

**Applications are reviewed in the order they're received and completed, on a rolling basis**, so it's advantageous to apply sooner rather than later.

If you are applying for admission to Fordham Law’s J.D. program for fall 2026, mark these important dates on your calendar. Deadlines are the same for both the full-time and part-time programs.

**September 15, 2025** — The date the application becomes available on [LSAC.org](https://www.lsac.org/).

**October 15, 2025** — The deadline for submitting an Early Action application. The latest LSAT you can submit to be considered Early Action is October 2025. Please note that if you are taking the October 2025 LSAT, you still must submit your application by October 15, to be considered.

**March 15, 2026** — The final date by which your application must be submitted to Fordham Law. The last LSAT we're accepting for fall 2026 applications is February 2026. However, we encourage applicants to aim for an earlier test date so they can apply sooner rather than later. We strongly suggest that applicants take the LSAT prior to the January test administration so that all application deadline requirements are met.

**March 15, 2026, 11:59 ESTT **— The deadline for submitting your application.

**Notification timeline**Generally, applications are processed within two weeks. Applicants can expect decisions approximately 12 business weeks after completing their applications. Applicants can view the status of their application directly in their

[JD LSAC account](https://aso.lsac-unite.org/?guid=gsWj5A1mZaU%3D).

### Components of your application

**1. Application for admission**

We strongly recommend that all applicants apply electronically through the [Law School Admission Council (LSAC) Flexible Application](https://os.lsac.org/Release/Logon/Access.aspx), which is accessible to the visually impaired. However, if you need a paper application, [contact us](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a4c8c5d3c5c0c9cdd7d7cdcbcad7e4c8c5d38ac2cbd6c0ccc5c98ac1c0d1), and we will send you a downloadable one. Remember that paper applications will take an additional two weeks to process and require payment via check or money order.


**2. Credential Assembly Service Report**

Transcripts from each college or university you have attended should be forwarded to LSAC, which will prepare and transmit a Law School Credential Assembly Service (CAS) Report to Fordham Law School. In addition, applicants who have received academic credit for coursework taken abroad must request that the issuing institution send their [international academic records directly to LSAC](https://www.lsac.org/applying-law-school/jd-application-process/cas/requesting/international-transcripts), if the credits do not appear on their home school transcript. To register for the CAS service, visit [LSAC](http://www.lsac.org/?utm_source=applicationprocess&utm_medium=overview&utm_content=link-LSAC&utm_campaign=jdapplication).


**3. Two letters of recommendation**

Submit at least two [letters of recommendation](https://www.lsac.org/applying-law-school/jd-application-process/credential-assembly-service-cas/letters-recommendation) through LSAC’s CAS service. Letters from current or former professors are preferred. If you graduated five or more years ago, professional letters are acceptable. While we require two letters, you can submit up to four.


**4. Personal statement**

Fordham Law School welcomes and celebrates the equal dignity of students of all backgrounds. In evaluating admissions applications, we want to learn who you are as an individual to hear your personal story. We value the diversity of a vibrant law school community in the center of the most diverse city in the world, and we celebrate the many ways that individual students can bring wisdom and passion to the law school and those they will serve in their legal careers. Both the required personal essay and the optional personal essay allow you to complete your application by communicating, effectively and concisely, other aspects of yourself beyond your undergraduate grades and test scores.

**Please limit each essay to two double-spaced pages using 11 or 12-point font.**

**REQUIRED PERSONAL ESSAY**

While the topic of this required essay is up to you, the most successful personal statements are those that develop a sense of the applicant and their values, aspirations, and concerns. As Fordham Law School's motto is "In the Service of Others," we are also interested in hearing about contributions you would like to make to our student body, the legal profession, and, ultimately, the larger society.

**OPTIONAL PERSONAL ESSAY**

Educating lawyers to represent clients whose problems and perspectives grow out of a wide range of life circumstances is fundamental to Fordham Law School's mission. For this optional personal essay, please discuss how your life experiences or aspects of your personal identity have motivated or inspired you, posed challenges, helped you build skills, and/or taught you valuable lessons. We are eager to learn how these experiences or aspects of your identity have helped shape who you are and prepared you for the study and practice of law to help others who need your expertise to solve hard problems.


**5. Standardized test scores **

We accept scores from the following exams: [LSAT,](https://www.lsac.org/lsat) [GRE](https://www.ets.org/gre.html), and [JD-Next](https://jdnext.org/).

LSAT scores are transmitted through LSAC’s CAS service. If you apply without an LSAT score, we will hold your application until we receive one. The last LSAT we’re accepting for fall 2026 applications is February 2026. If you are registered for a future LSAT (up to February 2026), we will hold your application until we receive the new score. If you do not want us to keep your application for a future LSAT score, please email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d7bbb6a0b6b3babea4a4beb8b9a497b1b8a5b3bfb6baf9b2b3a2), and we will release the hold.

GRE scores can be submitted directly through ETS. Fordham Law’s GRE Code is **3329**. The last GRE we can accept for fall 2026 applications is February 2026. Additionally, we required all GRE scores from the past five years to be reported.

JD-Next is administered by Aspen Publishing. At the end of the JD-Next exam, you will be able to select Fordham Law to receive your score. The latest JD-Next score we can accept for fall 2026 applications is session 4 (February 2026). Any scores after this date would be eligible for the fall 2027 application.

Please note that if you have any reportable LSAT scores on your file, we will use that score in evaluating your application, even if you submit a GRE or JD-Next score.


**6. Resume**

Submit a resume (PDF format) along with your application. Your resume should highlight your professional and academic achievements, volunteer experiences, and extracurricular involvement. While one page is preferred, you may submit a longer resume. Please use discretion when determining your resume length.


**7. Application addendum (optional)**

You're also welcome to submit any optional statements and/or appendices. If you choose to submit an optional statement, it should not exceed two double-spaced pages.


**8. Scholarships**

All applicants, regardless of citizenship status, will be considered for a merit-based scholarship. No separate application is necessary in order to be considered. If you are selected for a scholarship award, you will be notified by the Financial Aid Office via email.

Additionally, all incoming and transfer students have the opportunity to apply for Fordham Law’s need-based grants regardless of citizenship status. Grants will range in award amount, and be limited in number.
