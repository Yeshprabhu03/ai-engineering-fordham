# J.D. Admissions FAQs

View answers to frequently asked questions by topic:

**How long will it take for my application to be reviewed?**

Once an application has been received and marked as complete by our team, applicants can expect decisions in approximately 12 business weeks.

**Can I apply to the full-time and part-time programs at the same time?**

No, you can only apply to one program per admissions cycle. If you are waitlisted for the full-time program, you can also opt to be considered for the part-time evening waitlist.

**Does Fordham Law have an early action program?**

We have a nonbinding Early Action program for the full-time and part-time programs. To qualify, you must apply with a completed application by **October 15.** If you do this, you will be automatically considered for the program. You don't need to indicate you're applying for Early Action anywhere on the application. Any applicant who abides by these guidelines will receive a decision by December 15.

An Early Action decision can be: admitted, denied, or placed on the Early Action Waitlist. If your application were placed on the Early Action Waitlist, the Admissions Committee would conduct a second review of your file in February (likely toward the middle of the month). At that time, you will receive another decision: admitted, denied, or waitlisted. While it's not required, you're welcome to submit additional materials before your application is reviewed in February.

**Does Fordham Law have a binding early decision program?**

No, Fordham Law currently does not offer an early decision program.

** Will you hold my application for a future JD-Next or GRE score? **

No, we do not automatically hold your application for a future JD-Next or GRE score. If you would like your application to be held for a future JD-Next or GRE score, you will need to email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a9c5c8dec8cdc4c0dadac0c6c7dae9cfc6cdc1c8c487cccddc) to request the hold. Otherwise, if you already have a reported score, your application will be pushed forward for review by the Admissions Committee.

**Can my application be reconsidered if I am not offered admission? **

If you were not offered admission, you could request reconsideration of your application for the part-time division. To do so, email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7d111c0a1c1910140e0e1412130e3d111c0a531b120f19151c1053181908) with your request for reconsideration. Please be aware that the reconsideration process takes place in August, at which time a second and final decision will be rendered.

**Can I apply if I have been academically dismissed from another law school?**

Yes, you can apply to the JD program at Fordham Law School if you have been previously dismissed from another Law School. You will be required to complete a standard JD application and provide official transcripts from all previous law school coursework.

**Does Fordham Law allow prospective students to sit in on classes?**

Unfortunately, we can only let admitted students sit in on courses due to space limitations. If you're an admitted student, please email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f894998f999c95918c8c9d9cb894998fd69e978a9c909995d69d9c8d) with your request.

**If I'm not admitted, can I reapply?**

Yes, you're welcome to reapply the following cycle. While the committee will have access to your previous application materials, you will submit a new application that will be evaluated within the context of the new admissions cycle.

**What are my chances of being admitted?**

While we can't tell you your chances of being accepted, please be aware that we take a holistic approach to the admissions process and consider all aspects of an application (as detailed in our website application procedure section). You can also read more about our [selection criteria](/school-of-law/admissions/jd-admissions/apply-to-fordham-law/entering-class-profiles/).

**What does it mean if my application is placed on the Early Action Waitlist?**

If your application was placed on the Early Action Waitlist, the Admissions Committee will conduct a second review your file in February (likely toward the end of the month). At that time, you will receive another decision: admitted, denied, or waitlisted. Please note: if you applied for Early Action and were placed on the Early Action Waitlist, that constitutes a decision. While it’s not required, you’re welcome to submit additional materials before your application is reviewed in February.

**Does Fordham Law utilize a waitlist?**

Yes. The waitlist size varies from year to year and is not ranked. Admission from the waitlist can occur as early as the end of May and as late as August during the orientation week. Therefore, the waitlist process is very fluid, and we cannot predict the number of offers we will make each year. Finally, as the committee evaluates waitlisted candidates, while it is possible for admission to be offered, there can be some candidates who are denied before the closing of the admissions cycle.

**Can I defer my acceptance?**

We grant binding one-year deferrals on a case-by-case basis. We only grant two-year deferrals if you have committed to a program with a two-year time frame (i.e., Peace Corps, Teach for America, etc.).

**How can I meet with an admissions officer?**

You can schedule an appointment for [Zoom Office Hours](https://calendly.com/fordhamlawadmissions/zoom-office-hours). If you'd like to speak with an Admissions Officer, please call 212-636-6810 during regular business hours (weekdays from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM ET). No appointment is necessary.

**Does Fordham Law offer housing to students?**

Off-campus [graduate housing](/student-life/living-on-campus/living-on-campus-at-lincoln-center/graduate-housing/) is available to entering 1Ls at Wilshire Plaza. Students interested in living off-campus should contact Graduate Housing at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ccabbeada8a4a3b9bfa5a2ab8caaa3bea8a4ada1e2a9a8b9). Most students secure their off-campus housing in NYC, and you can learn more about students' living situations in our [Housing Guide.](https://www.veryapt.com/guides/housing/23-fordham-law/)

**How many credits are needed to complete the J.D. program?**

Eighty-three credits are required for graduation.

**What does a typical schedule look like for full-time and part-time students?**

Full-time students are expected to be available Monday through Thursday from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM and Friday from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM. Full-time students will be assigned four classes — Legal Writing & Research and three other fundamental classes.

Part-time students are expected to be available Monday through Thursday from 6:00 PM to 9:45 PM. Part-time students will be assigned three classes — Legal Writing & Research and two other fundamental classes.

**What's the typical class size?**

First-year classes can range anywhere from 16 to 80 students. As a 1L, you're assigned to a section consisting of approximately 40 other students. Some 1L classes will be only your section (about 40 students). Other classes will be two sections combined (about 80 students). For example, Legal Writing & Research will be 16-18 students.

As an upper-class student, most of your classes will be under 25 students. More information can be found in our [ABA Standard 509 Information Report](/school-of-law/aba-required-disclosures/).

**What is the student-to-faculty ratio?**

More information about the student to faculty statistics can be found in our [ABA Standard 509 Information Report](/school-of-law/aba-required-disclosures/).
