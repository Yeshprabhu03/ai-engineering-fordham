![part time jd image](https://pxl-fordhamedu.terminalfour.net/prod01/channel_2/media/home/schools/school-of-law/hero-banners/Courthouse_Steps_8942_web.jpeg)

## Fordham's evening program is #3 in the nation and #1 in New York

Want to earn a law degree but can’t enroll full-time for three years? Then the part-time, evening program at Fordham Law may be the solution.

### Fordham Law understands the needs of part-time students

Fordham Law is committed to ensuring you have every opportunity to succeed as a part-time student in our rigorous yet caring academic environment. For more than 100 years, Fordham Law has welcomed remarkably diverse and academically gifted students balancing career, family, and part-time legal study.

In recent years, a working pathologist, a 10-year army veteran, an entrepreneur, an actor, and a housing rights advocate have all enrolled part-time. Like these students, you’ll be able to complete your degree in eight semesters.

Flexibility is key, which is why we offer class times that fit your schedule—evening classes Monday through Thursday, optional Saturdays, hybrid courses, condensed 7-week courses, and a two-week January term.

Depending on your schedule, you’ll be able to participate in the school’s activities, groups, and networking events. Some activities, such as regular pizza nights, are exclusively designed for evening students.

### Ready to apply?

The application process is the same for full-time and part-time JD students.
