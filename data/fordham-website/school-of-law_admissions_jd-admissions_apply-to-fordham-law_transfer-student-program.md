# Transfer Student Program

Transfer applicants must have completed at least one year in a J.D. program at an American Bar Association (ABA)-approved law school and be in good academic standing. Transfer candidates will be accepted for enrollment only at the beginning of an academic year in the fall. For transfer students admitted from ABA-accredited law schools, credit for classes in which the student has earned a "C" or better will be accepted (up to 31 credits).

Students will be advised on whether their course credits were accepted to be transferred over and if those credits were applied to required courses before they are asked to commit to attending Fordham Law.

**Transfer applicants must submit the following:**

- A completed Fordham Law application with the $75 application fee.
- A complete law school transcript includes all grades earned in the first year and subsequent years of the applicant's law school enrollment. Applicants are welcome to submit unofficial transcripts to

If an unofficial transcript is submitted, it must be followed up with an official transcript as a condition of enrollment. Official transcripts can be submitted through[LSAC](https://www.lsac.org/)or directly from an applicant's current law school. - An official CAS report from
