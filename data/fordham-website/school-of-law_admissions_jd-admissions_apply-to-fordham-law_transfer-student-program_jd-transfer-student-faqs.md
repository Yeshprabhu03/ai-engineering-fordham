[Application component](#FAQ topic 1)[Academic programs and resources](#FAQ topic 2)[Transfer student eligibility](#FAQ topic 3)[Transfer student experience](#FAQ topic 4)

**Does Fordham Law provide application fee waivers for transfer applications?**

No, we do not have application fee waivers for transfer applications.

**Does Fordham Law have a minimum GPA requirement for transfer students?**

No, but we generally admit transfer students who are in the top 15-20% of their law school classes. In addition to 1L grades, we also consider an applicant’s: statement detailing why they’re interested in transferring to Fordham Law; resume; and letters of recommendation.

**Can I apply as a transfer student if I didn't take the LSAT?**

Yes, the LSAT isn’t a requirement for transfer applications.

**How many transfer students does Fordham Law enroll?**

We enroll approximately 15-30 transfer students each fall.

**Academic programs and resources FAQs**

**Can I apply as a transfer student to start in the spring?**

No, we only enroll transfer students once per year in the fall. The** fall 2026** transfer student application will open on **March 15, 2026**. Keep in mind that we can't start reviewing an application until it is complete.

**Are transfer students eligible for scholarships?**

No, transfer students are not eligible for merit-based scholarships, but they can apply for need-based grants. If admitted, transfer students will receive access to a comprehensive [Admitted Student Portal](https://my.lawnet.fordham.edu/sites/admittedjdstudentportal) where they can find the need-based grant application.

**If my transfer application was denied, then can I ask to be reconsidered?**

All transfer decisions are final.

** Can I transfer if I've completed more than 1 year of law school?**

Yes, but we accept a maximum of 31 credits, which includes all your grades from your 1L year. You'll likely lose credits in the transfer process if admitted to Fordham Law.

** Can I apply as a transfer student if I've completed just 1 semester of law school?**

You can still apply to Fordham Law, but not as a transfer student. You would need to complete the [regular application](/school-of-law/admissions/jd-admissions/apply-to-fordham-law/). In addition to the regular [application requirements](/school-of-law/admissions/jd-admissions/apply-to-fordham-law/application-requirements/), you would also need to submit a letter of good standing and a transcript from your current/previous law school. If admitted, you would not be able to transfer any previous law school credits.

** Can I apply as a transfer if I attended law school multiple years ago?**

Yes, you would adhere to the same transfer admissions requirements. Of note, any transfer applicant would need to have completed at least one year of credit at a previous law school, regardless of the length of time out of their previous program.

** If admitted, then how long will I have to make a decision?**

Admitted transfer students are given approximately two weeks before they’re asked to make a $600 deposit.

**Transfer student eligibility FAQs**

** Can I transfer from a part-time J.D. program to Fordham Law's part-time J.D. program?**

If you’re currently enrolled in a part-time J.D. program and applying for Fordham Law’s [part-time J.D. program](https://digital.law.fordham.edu/specialty-areas/part-time-evening-program/), we need a full year of law school grades (fall and spring semesters) in order to make a decision. If you’re taking summer classes at your current law school, there’s no guarantee those credits will transfer over if admitted to Fordham Law. You must have approximately **22 credits** to be considered for the part-time J.D. program. We accept a maximum of **31 credits**.

** Can I transfer from a part-time program to Fordham's full-time J.D. program?**

Yes, but you must take summer classes at your current law school in order to have enough credits for Fordham Law’s full-time J.D. program. We can’t make a decision until we have grades from your summer classes. You must have at least** 28 credits** to be considered for the full-time J.D. program. Since grades for summer classes are usually posted later in our transfer admissions cycle, please be aware that this would decrease your chances of admission. We usually finish transfer admissions by the beginning of August.

** Can I transfer to Fordham Law's J.D. program from an LL.M. program?**

No, you cannot transfer to Fordham’s Law’s J.D. program from an LL.M. program. You would need to complete the [regular application](/school-of-law/admissions/jd-admissions/apply-to-fordham-law/), applying to either the full-time J.D. program or the part-time program.

**Transfer student experience FAQs**

** Can transfer students participate in Fordham Law School’s Recruiting Programs?**

**Special Note Regarding Large Law Firm Recruiting**: Large law firms began recruiting and interviewing rising second-year J.D. candidates in the fall of 2025 and early spring of 2026. Therefore, prospective transfer students interested in these firms should begin applying as soon as applications open in late fall and early spring, before their admission as transfer students. The majority of large firms will have filled their 2027 summer associate classes by early summer 2026.

Fordham Law School offers two main recruiting opportunities in late summer and fall. Employers participating in these programs include a mix of small and midsize firms, government agencies, and public interest organizations:

**Fall Resume Collect Programs (Fall RC)**: These Programs have deadlines in August and September.**Fall Virtual Interview Program (Fall VIP)**: This takes place over several weeks in September and October.

**Each of those segments has its own student bid deadline:**

- Friday, August 14, 2026, for August Resume Collect
- Friday, August 21, 2026 for the first week of Fall VIP

To participate in any of these segments of the fall recruiting program, **a transfer student must be admitted and fully deposited no later than six (6) business days before the student bid deadline for that session**. For example, to participate in August Resume Collect, a transfer student must be admitted and fully deposited no later than Thursday, August 6, 2026.

**If you are considering transferring and have any questions about recruiting, please contact Ann Murray ( [email protected]).**

** Can transfer students join law journals?**

Yes, transfer students are invited to participate in a writing competition (generally during the first week of the fall semester) in order to be considered for one of Fordham Law’s [six student-edited law journals](/school-of-law/academics/student-journals/). More information is provided during orientation.

** How do transfer students register for classes?**

**After submitting your deposit, someone from the Registrar’s Office will be in touch to assist with class registration.**

** What if the 1L classes I took at my current law school differ from Fordham's 1L law courses?**

Many 1Ls follow very similar class schedules regardless of the law school they attend. If you took classes that don’t count toward Fordham Law’s [1L curriculum](/school-of-law/academics/registrars-office/academic-regulations/), they will likely count as electives. If you haven’t taken a course that is required as a 1L at Fordham Law, you’ll take it as a 2L.
