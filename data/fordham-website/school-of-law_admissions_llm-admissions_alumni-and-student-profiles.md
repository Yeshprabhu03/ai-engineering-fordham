"While looking for a LL.M. in Corporate Compliance, Fordham was always on the top of the list. Making the decision to go to Fordham was easy thanks to the experienced and organized members of their community, and the opportunity to study part-time in Fordham's Corporate Compliance LL.M. sealed the deal."

"For me, Fordham Law was more than just the ideal way of securing a top-tier legal education without compromising my career at the United Nations. Fordham was also my point of entry to the various peer networks and academic groups of our legal professional which will stay with me for the rest of my professional life."

"From the moment that I got my acceptance letter from Fordham, I knew it was the right place for me because of the warmth in the welcome and the personalized interaction provided by members of the faculty. The Intellectual Property and Information Technology program at Fordham has provided me with an opportunity to broaden my horizons in technology law and the U.S. market at large in which I currently practice and see myself in the future."



**Florencia Villaggi (Argentina) LL.M. ’22, Counsel, Herbert Smith Freehills (New York)**

"As a full-time practitioner in an international firm (and a busy mom), I wanted to pursue a part-time LL.M. program to gain eligibility to sit for the New York Bar examination while balancing career, family, and study. Fordham was a natural choice as its part-time program has over 100 years of history and a superb reputation. Everything is extremely well organized, and the classes are dynamic and engaging. The community is just so welcoming and generous."

"Prior to attending Fordham's LL.M. program, I had worked in the compliance department of international banks. Through this specialized compliance program, I have had the opportunity to see topics I have worked on during my career from a new perspective by connecting with students from around the world and learning from professors with extensive experience in the field."
