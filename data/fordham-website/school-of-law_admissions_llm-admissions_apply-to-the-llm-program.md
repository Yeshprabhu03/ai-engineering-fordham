**Applications are reviewed in the order they're received on a rolling basis**, **so it's advantageous to apply sooner rather than later. **

Application components

**Transcripts**

Applicants must submit an official transcript from each college, university, graduate, and law school attended, regardless of whether the program was completed or a degree was awarded.

**Personal statement**

All applicants must submit a 500-word personal statement describing your reasons for pursuing this graduate degree, where you plan to practice in five years, and the contributions your hope to make to the legal profession upon completion of the course of study.

**Two letters of recommendation**

Applicants must submit two letters of recommendation. Each letter should be from someone who knows you well and can provide a candid personalized evaluation of your potential success in the graduate program. If possible, at least one letter should be from a law professor or law school dean.

**Resume/CV**

Applicants must submit a current resume or curriculum vitae. Your resume or curriculum vitae should include your complete university educational experience, employment history, and additional academic or professional activities.

**TOEFL,IETS, or Duolingo score**

All applicants are required to take either the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), or Duolingo English Test unless they hold a university-level degree from the United States or a country where English is the language of instruction in law school. Applicants taking the TOEFL are expected to attain a score of 100 on the TOEFL, 7 on the IELTS, or 120 on the Duolingo test. For more information regarding test dates and fees, visit [http://www.ets.org/toefl](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.ets.org/toefl&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1677625105954395&usg=AOvVaw26-UhQnc6p5RiCQ3qzBUkK). For more information on IELTS, visit [www.ielts.org](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.ielts.org&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1677625105954500&usg=AOvVaw1YDHGoTd7RpO_LWeOtgDnH). Fordham Law School’s TOEFL Code Number is 2264. Duolingo scores can be submitted from your online Duolingo account to Fordham Law LLM Admissions.

LL.M. eligibility

Applicants to the LL.M. program generally must hold a J.D. (Juris Doctor) from an ABA-approved U.S. law school or a first law degree (J.D., LL.B., or the equivalent) from a foreign law school or university at the time of matriculation. Those admitted to practice law in any foreign jurisdiction are also generally eligible to apply. Please contact us if you are unsure about your eligibility or have questions.

NY Bar exam eligibility

Many international law school graduates are able to "cure" their foreign law degree by completing a qualifying LL.M. degree. All nine of our LL.M. specializations at Fordham Law meet this "cure provision" for the NY bar exam. NY Bar eligibility is determined by the [NY BOLE](https://www.nybarexam.org/foreign/foreignlegaleducation.htm). Admission to the LL.M. program does not guarantee eligibility to sit for the NY bar exam. Therefore, you should have the NY BOLE review your transcripts from your first law degree to determine eligibility.

We accept applications after the application deadline if space is available. However, applicants considering late submission should be aware of course registration dates, typically in the beginning of June for the fall term and mid-October for the spring term. After the initial registration date, course selection may be restricted as many classes close quickly due to enrollment limits. If you are admitted after the registration date, we will do our best to help you register for the courses that interest you, but cannot guarantee course availability. For exact registration dates, please see the law school academic [calendar](https://www.fordham.edu/info/30394/school_of_law_academic_calendar).

Please also be advised that if you require a visa to study at Fordham for the on campus LL.M, program, visa processing times are lengthy and are out of our control. Fordham's Office for International Services requires several weeks to issue I-20 documentation. If you are unable to secure a visa before our start date, you will have to defer to another semester.
