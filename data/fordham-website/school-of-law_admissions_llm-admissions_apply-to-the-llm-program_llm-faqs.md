# LL.M. FAQs

**Review our answers to FAQs by topic:**

**How long is the LL.M. program?**

**The full-time LL.M. program is two semesters. If you begin your full-time LL.M. program in the fall (August), you will end your program at the end of the spring semester (May). If you begin your full-time LL.M. program in the spring (January), you will end your program in the fall semester (December). You have up to two years to complete your studies at the start of your part-time program. LL.M. students can also stay an additional semester (or take the equivalent 12 credits part-time) to add a second concentration to their LL.M.**

**Does Fordham Law offer financial aid or scholarships?**

Yes, [check out our LL.M. scholarships resource.](/school-of-law/admissions/llm-admissions/scholarships/)

**Does Fordham Law provide career development assistance? **

Fordham Law offers comprehensive career planning services to full-time LL.M. students through [the Graduate Professional Development Program](/school-of-law/careers/llmmslsjd-career-support/graduate-professional-development-program/) (GPDP). Services include career advising, practice interviews, resume and cover letter critiques, and numerous programs addressing topics of interest to LLM students.

**Am I eligible to sit for the New York state bar exam?**

Most students who complete our in-person LL.M. program are eligible to sit for the New York state bar exam. However, completing the LL.M. degree does not certify New York state bar eligibility. Therefore, students who plan to sit for the New York State Bar should submit all documentation to the New York State Board of Law Examiners as early as possible (ideally before they begin their LL.M. studies) for an advance evaluation of eligibility. The procedure for this evaluation and the online form is available on the [New York State Bar Examination ](http://www.nybarexam.org/Foreign/ForeignLegalEducation.htm)website. Foreign-trained students cannot gain eligibility to sit for the New York State Bar by enrolling in our online LL.M. program.

**What is the 50-hour pro bono requirement?**

**The New York State Court of Appeals has a rule requiring applicants for admission to the New York State bar to perform 50 hours of pro bono services. Learn more about pro bono services.**

**Does Fordham Law offer English as a second language (ESL) classes?**

For applicants unable to demonstrate sufficient English proficiency through our TOEFL or IELTS requirements, we are pleased to offer admission contingent on full-time enrollment and satisfactory progress in Fordham Law's [Legal English Institute (LEI)](https://www.fordham.edu/info/26808/legal_english_institute).

**Does Fordham Law offer any executive LL.M. options?**

Yes, the [Professional Track LLM program ](/school-of-law/academics/curriculum/llm-curriculum/professional-track-llm/)is perfect for working global practitioners whose professional demands prevent them from completing a traditional nine-month LL.M. residency. In addition, students in the program can become eligible to sit for the New York State bar examination by completing the degree in two years.

**What is TOEFL, IELTS, or Duolingo score required for admission?**

To demonstrate sufficient fluency on the TOEFL, you must score 100 or above on the internet-based TOEFL, 250 or above on the computer-based TOEFL, or 600 or above on the paper-based TOEFL. For IELTS, the minimum score is 7. For Duolingo, the minimum score is 120. The admissions committee will consider applicants who do not attain the minimum score. Sometimes we offer interviews and conditional acceptance to applicants with lower scores, but these options are provided solely at the discretion of the admissions committee.

For applicants unable to demonstrate sufficient English proficiency through our TOEFL, IELTS, or Duolingo requirement, we are pleased to offer admission contingent on full-time enrollment and satisfactory progress in Fordham Law's Legal English Institute (LEI).

**Can I apply for a TOEFL waiver?**

The admissions committee rarely grants exceptions to the language assessment requirement. Therefore, we strongly encourage those not meeting our narrow exemption to sit for a TOEFL, IELTS or Duolingo exam. If your legal education was conducted entirely in English, request a waiver of the TOEFL requirement by indicating so on your application form.

**Do I need to take the LSAT?**

Applicants to the LL.M. program with a law degree from outside the United States are not required to sit for the LSAT exam. Applicants to the LL.M. program who received a J.D. from an American law school should disclose their LSAT scores at the time of application.

**Are interviews required?**

The admissions committee will occasionally interview as part of the application review process. Should the committee feel that an interview would be helpful, you will be notified by email.

**The application deadline has passed. Can I still apply?**

Yes. We do accept late applications on a space-available basis. Visit the [LL.M. application requirements page](/school-of-law/admissions/llm-admissions/apply-to-the-llm-program/) for a list of active applications and instructions. Keep in mind that students who are admitted after the start of registration may find themselves closed out of some classes due to enrollment limits.

**May I apply for conditional acceptance?**

Yes. The admissions committee may offer admission contingent on full-time enrollment and satisfactory progress in [Fordham's Legal English Institute (LEI)](https://www.fordham.edu/info/26808/legal_english_institute?_ga=2.71339795.1243300994.1660233577-1915424657.1652463807) for applicants unable to demonstrate sufficient English proficiency through our TOEFL or IELTS requirements. Students that are conditionally accepted will be enrolled in the non-credit option. Please apply through the regular admissions process, and include a TOEFL or IELTS score with your application. The admissions committee will consider whether to grant conditional admission.

**How does enrollment deferment work?**

After you are admitted to our program, we understand that other commitments may affect your enrollment date. Therefore, if you need to defer to the following semester, contact our office at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6f4a5d5f0303022f09001d0b070e02410a0b1a) so we can address your request for postponement.

**Why was I denied admission to the LL.M. program? Can I reapply?**

The admissions committee deliberations are confidential and not shared with applicants. However, the committee considers a variety of factors when making their decision, including but not limited to academic performance, personal statement, letters of recommendation, English-language ability, and professional experience. So yes. Applicants who have been denied admission may reapply but should be aware that the committee's decision is not likely to change unless they can demonstrate a significant change in qualifications.

**May I receive a copy of my application materials?**

No. Once you submit your application materials, they become the property of Fordham University and may not be returned to the applicant.
