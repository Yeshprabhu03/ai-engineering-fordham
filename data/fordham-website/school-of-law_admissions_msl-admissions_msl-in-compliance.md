# M.S.L. in Compliance

## Your path to advancing your compliance career.

**Compliance is a growing field that is global in scope.**

Fordham is at the vanguard of this evolving and expanding field—and our master's degree in compliance will put you there, too.

Whether you're already working in compliance or want to forge an exciting new career path, the program will help you develop a sophisticated understanding of compliance. You will be learning in New York City, the world capital of business and finance.

**This flexible master’s degree can accelerate your career.**

You can choose between full-time study to complete the degree in one year (two semesters) or enroll part-time. Either way, you'll gain the skills to effectively design, implement, monitor, and evaluate corporate compliance programs. You'll learn about core topics such as international financial crime, legislation and regulation, and risk assessment.

In the last semester of your degree, you will complete a "capstone" paper or project to demonstrate your ability to apply what you've learned in the program practically.

You'll also have opportunities to network with leading compliance professionals through events and programs available through Fordham Law School and its [Corporate Law Center](http://law.fordham.edu/corporatecenter), as well as Fordham University's [Gabelli School of Business](/gabelli-school-of-business/).

Scholarship funding is available, including one full tuition scholarship for a full-time student. Review the [M.S.L.
