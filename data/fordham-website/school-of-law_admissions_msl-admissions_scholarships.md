**Fordham Law Graduate Student Scholarship**

The admissions committee awards partial scholarships to select M.S.L. applicants based on merit. There is no separate application process to be considered; Graduate Student Scholarships are awarded at the sole discretion of the admissions committee during their review of completed applications. Priority consideration is given to those with applications completed by the early, scholarship deadline, May 1. Graduate program staff will notify applicants if they have been selected for a merit scholarship award.

*Graduate Student Scholarships may not be deferred to a later year. Applicants who defer their admission may request to have their application filen reconsidered for a Graduate Student Scholarship during the review process for the next fall semester.*

**External scholarships and resources**

You are encouraged to seek additional sources of funding. Our office has gathered together a list of external scholarships and resources that may be relevant to LL.M. and/or M.S.L. students. You are encouraged to [use this list](https://my.lawnet.fordham.edu/sites/nonjdstudentresources/SitePages/Opportunities-and-Resources.aspx) as a starting place in your search.

**Tuition payment **

Tuition invoices are mailed to students prior to the start of each semester, and will also be posted to students' [fordham.edu](http://fordham.edu/) accounts. Students are expected to check their accounts regularly and make sure that tuition payments are made on time. Students who do not pay their tuition on time will be assessed late charges by the University.

Any questions about tuition or billing should be directed to the Enrollment Services Office at 718-817-4900 or at s[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#96e5e2e3f2f3f8e2f7f5f5f9e3f8e2e5d6f0f9e4f2fef7fbb8f3f2e3).
