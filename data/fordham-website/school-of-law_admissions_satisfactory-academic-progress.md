# Satisfactory Academic Progress

Students who fail to attain satisfactory academic progress by the end of each academic year will lose federal financial aid eligibility, ability to borrow from the Federal Direct Loan and the Direct Graduate PLUS Loan.

If the student resumes satisfactory academic progress, then the student will regain federal financial aid eligibility as long as the student maintains satisfactory academic progress.

If the student is not maintaining satisfactory academic progress, then the Law Office of Financial Aid will contact the student before the beginning of the Fall semester. Appeals may be granted through the Office of Student Affairs.
