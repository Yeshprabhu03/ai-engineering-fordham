# Residency and Time for Completion

Doctoral degree candidates are required to be in residence for the first year of the S.J.D. program. It is recommended but not required that such candidates remain in residence during the second and third years of the program. The candidate should determine the precise period of residency beyond the first year in consultation with his or her Dissertation Advisor.

Candidates are generally expected to spend a minimum of one month in residence each year in which he or she is not in residence. Candidates are expected to maintain regular contact with their Dissertation Advisers throughout the program.

Candidates are expected to complete their dissertation within three years. Students who need additional time to complete their work must make a written request seeking an extension and explaining why the extension is justified. Typically, no extensions beyond the third year will be approved. Additional financial commitments beyond the third year may also be incurred.

A leave of absence from the S.J.D. studies may be requested from the Assistant Dean for International and Non-J.D. programs, accompanied by an email of support from the candidate's supervisor. Candidates may not take more than two years' leave of absence cumulatively.
