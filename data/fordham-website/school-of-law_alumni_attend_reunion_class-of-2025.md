Fordham Law taught me the importance of practicing with compassion and good intent. I made life long connections and remain a proud alum to this day. The Drew Valentine Student Service Award is an example of my commitment. Its an endowed fund that recognizes Fordham law graduates that strengthened the culture and gave back to their fellow students. Black Letter X for Life!
