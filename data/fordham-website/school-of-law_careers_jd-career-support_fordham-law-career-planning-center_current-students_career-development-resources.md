For the benefit of students and graduates searching for a job outside the New York metropolitan area, the CPC has reciprocity agreements with law school career planning offices across the country. This service allows a student/graduate to access certain services at the career services office of a participating school in the desired geographic area.

Step 1: Identify at which law school to request reciprocity

Each law school has its own policies pertaining to available resources for reciprocity students; therefore, to help you decide which school to request reciprocity from, you should call that school's career planning office to find out exactly which services/resources you are allowed access (i.e. online job board, counseling services).

As a good starting point to research other schools, students/graduates should visit the

[NALP website](https://www.nalp.org/reciprocitypolicies)(https://www.nalp.org/reciprocitypolicies) for a list of reciprocity policies at law schools around the country.Questions to Ask When Choosing a School for Reciprocity:

- Which services will you have access to (counseling, job lists, etc.)?
- When are the blackout dates?
- How many times may you visit during the time period set?

General Policies:

- Students/Graduates
**cannot**obtain reciprocity from law schools that are**within a 90-mile radius**of Fordham Law School. - Students/Graduates are limited to one reciprocity request per semester per city (i.e., one for the Washington D.C. area and one for the Boston area), not to exceed four requests per semester.
- Reciprocity services are generally suspended at most law schools during their busy OCI periods. Therefore you should inquire with the particular school as to its blackout dates.

**Please Note:****Fordham Law School's Reciprocity is suspended from June 1 through November 1.**Step 2: Request Reciprocity Services

Once you decide from which law school you wish to receive reciprocity services, the CPC must make the request for services on your behalf. Therefore, please email your request to

[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4b282a392e2e39380b272a3c652d24392f232a26652e2f3e).The email request to

[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2142405344445352614d40560f474e534549404c0f444554)should include the following information:- the name, title, and email address of the Reciprocity Coordinator at the selected school
- the school's address
- your graduation year
- the date/time frame you plan on visiting the school

You will be copied on the email request that we make to that school. Once the request is granted, the other school will email you directly with the reciprocity letter and policy. Please make sure to read the policy thoroughly and follow the necessary guidelines. The policy will include information such as: (i) the length of time you may use the services and (ii) the number of times you may visit. Please note that it may take a few weeks to arrange the service, so plan ahead.

In December 2018, NALP eliminated its long-standing

*Principles and Standards for Law Placement and Recruitment Activities*, replacing them with the new*NALP Principles for a Fair and Ethical Recruitment Process*. Following that change, Fordham Law School adopted its own Recruiting Guidelines:The overarching goal of the

*2022-23 Fordham Law Recruiting Guidelines*, including the*2021-22 Fordham Law Guidelines for the Timing of Offers and Decisions*, is to foster and encourage communications between students and employers over the course of the recruiting process. In addition to following the specific provisions set forth below, students should keep employers informed, in a timely manner, about the status of their consideration of their offers, and employers should keep students informed, in a timely manner, as to the status of their candidacies.## 2022-23 Fordham Law Recruiting Guidelines

-
We expect employers to adhere to the

[2022-23 Fordham Law Guidelines for the Timing of Offers and Decisions](https://my.lawnet.fordham.edu/sites/careerservicesforcurrentjdstudents/SitePages/2022-23-Fordham-Law-Timing-Guidelines.aspx). -
Employers that recruit at Fordham are required to affirm their agreement with Fordham Law's Non-Discrimination Policy (below).

-
In addition, Fordham Law School students are expected to abide by the

[Fordham Law Professionalism Standards](https://my.lawnet.fordham.edu/sites/careerservicesforcurrentjdstudents/Shared%20Documents/FLS%20Professionalism%20Standards%20for%20the%20Job%20Search.pdf).

CPC Programs

-
Each semester the CPC hosts an extensive roster of Career Development Programs designed for JD Students focusing on three key areas: Skills-Based, Career Exploration, and Career Success/Professionalism.

Each year we welcome close to 150 alumni who participate in our programs allowing for students to interact directly with professionals in various areas of expertise. At all of our panel programs, time is reserved at the end for a “Networking Meet and Greet.".

-
Attending live programs provides wonderful networking opportunities with attorneys. However, the CPC recognizes that from time to time other commitments will prevent you from attending a Career Development program of interest. As such, we record all of our presentations and panels. We invite you to explore the streaming audio or video recording in the links below.
