# School of Law Centers and Institutes

Shaping Law and Policy

Whether advancing scholarship on critical legal issues, providing hands-on training for future lawyers, or delivering much-needed legal advice to the vulnerable and underrepresented, our centers, institutes, and programs make a real difference. These efforts are central to [our mission as a Jesuit institution](https://www.fordham.edu/about/mission-statement/) and connect us to a long Catholic tradition of study, service, and impact. Our faculty engages closely with students on a wide range of topics, from fashion law to privacy controversies born of the internet age, social justice, racial and gender inequality, complex and evolving intellectual property matter, national security, corporate law, and human rights.
