Special thanks to Professor Joe Lester for compiling all competition results at [www.trialteamcentral.org](http://www.trialteamcentral.org/).

The TCPR recognizes success at these competitions as one indicator of an effective trial advocacy education. The TCPR is not a measurement of a law school’s overall trial advocacy program. The TCPR cannot measure the breadth of offerings, quality of teaching, or most importantly, student learning. The unwavering goal of trial advocacy education should be to prepare law students to advocate and win trials on behalf of their clients while maintaining the highest professional and ethical standards. Achievement at competitions can be an attending (albeit fun) byproduct of that quality education for those schools that choose to participate.

All TCPR points are allocated based on the competition result data compiled at

[http://www.trialteamcentral.org/](http://www.trialteamcentral.org/).Point allocation for all single-tournament national competitions is as follows: 3 points for winning the competition, 2 points for making it to the final round, and 1 point for making it to the semi-final round. For exclusively regional tournaments (AAJ Regionals, TYLA Regionals, Chester Bedall), each winning team is allocated 3 points. No points are allocated for regional finalists or semi-finalists.

For AAJ Nationals and TYLA Nationals, where all participating teams won regional qualifiers, the points are allocated as follows: 4 points for winning the competition, 3 points for making it to the final round, and 2 points for making it to the semi-final round. Additional weight is not given to other “selective” national competitions because each competition employs their own unique rubric for school selection and do not share the unquestionable objectivity of a regional tournament qualifier.

For the 2016-2017 year, no points were allocated for the ABA Employment Regional or National Competitions because of the limited and inconsistent result data available.
