The *Center for Judicial Events & Clerkships* Jurist in Residence Program brings prominent judges from across the country to the law school to engage with our law school community and share their expertise.

Our Jurists have the option to visit for a single day or a multi-day engagement.

During the course of their visit, judges are welcome to engage in all aspects of law school life from co-teaching courses to hosting roundtable discussions with student cohorts on topics ranging from their path to the bench to clerkships. In addition, we host an informal faculty lunch in honor of our jurist’s visit.

Distinguished Jurist in Residence Lecture

The Jurist’s visit culminates with a lecture to the entire law school community – faculty, students and alumni – on a timely and important legal topic of their interest or within their expertise. The lecture is immediately followed by a reception. The lecture is subsequently published in the Fordham Law Review.
