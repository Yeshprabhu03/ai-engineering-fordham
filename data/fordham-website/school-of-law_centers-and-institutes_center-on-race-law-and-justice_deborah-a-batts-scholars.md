# Deborah A. Batts Scholars

To honor the late Judge Deborah A. Batts, a trailblazing legal scholar and pioneering jurist, Fordham Law School created a scholarship program in her name. The program supports students dedicated to using their legal education to promote social justice, civil rights, and equality. An important component of the scholarship program is that recipients have the opportunity to work with the Center on crucial and timely issues of race, equality and social justice.

**2023 Batts FellowShanice Scantlebury '25**

Shanice is one of our 2023 Batts Research Fellows. She is originally from Barbados and grew up in the Bronx, New York. In 2015, she received a bachelor's degree from Williams College in History and Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. There, she cultivated a deeper understanding of the intricate tapestry of human stories and the unique challenges marginalized communities face. After graduating, she worked as an intellectual property paralegal in the fashion and tech industries for seven years. During this time, she witnessed the often disheartening reality of how large corporations and individuals gained protected rights to cultures they were not a part of and did not contribute to, but instead profited. As a result, she hopes to pursue a career in intellectual property to help disenfranchised communities protect and reclaim the rights to their culture's intellectual property.
