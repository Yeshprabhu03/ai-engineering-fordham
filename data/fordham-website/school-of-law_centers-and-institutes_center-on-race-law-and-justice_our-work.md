# Our Work

Making a substantive and an indelible impact in the continued fight for racial justice and equality, both domestically and internationally, is central to our mission at the Center on Race, Law and Justice.

Working in partnership and collaboration with individuals, communities, institutions, and organizations that have been tirelessly at the helm of the movement against racial inequality and discrimination is crucial. These partnerships also give an opportunity for our students to be part of exciting and innovative real world efforts to advance the movement for racial justice.

Below is a description of the current ongoing programs, partnerships, and collaborations the Center has developed and shaped and formed part of:

Youth Power, Not Guns Toolkit

The Right to Free, Prior and Informed Consent

Legal Empowerment - Democratizing the Law
