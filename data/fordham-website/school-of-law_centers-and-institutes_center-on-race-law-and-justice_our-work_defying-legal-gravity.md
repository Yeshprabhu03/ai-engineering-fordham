## Legal Empowerment for NYC Youth

Defying Legal Gravity is a 501c3 organization that democratizes the law by teaching the foundational, first-year law school curriculum through a critical race theory lens to New York City youth to increase legal literacy and civic engagement and to legally empower students to know, use, shape and ultimately transform the law.

DLG empowers New York City youth to know, use, shape and ultimately transform the law.

In collaboration with the Center on Race, Law, and Justice, Defying Legal Gravity hosts the Legal Empowerment Scholars Program that brings 15-20 underserved high school students across New York City to Fordham University School of Law to learn the foundational first-year law school curriculum through a critical race theory lens. Students attend classes every Saturday throughout the academic school year, starting in September.

Throughout the year, students learn Civil Procedure, Constitutional Law, Contracts, Torts, Criminal Law, Legal Research & Writing, and Property Law through the Case Method.

After completing the seven foundational courses, students complete a final project that furthers the field of **Legal Empowerment, which is rooted in strengthening the ability of communities to: "understand, use and shape the law." **

Students present their final projects to members of their communities at the graduation ceremony in June.
