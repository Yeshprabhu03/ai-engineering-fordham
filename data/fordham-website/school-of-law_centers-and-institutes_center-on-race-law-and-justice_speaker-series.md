# Race Law and the Public Intellectual Speaker Series

When it comes to matters of Race Law (the body of anti-discrimination laws, regulations, remedies, policies and cases) legal stakeholders (judges, juries, legislators etc.) are often very influenced by how issues of race and racism are discussed in the public discourse. As a result, lawyers working within the domain of racial equality jurisprudence must be proficient Public Intellectuals in addition to their roles as litigators, lobbyists and strategists. Short form expository writing in accessible language is critical to making effective contributions to the public debates on racial justice issues.

The aim of this series is to provide a space for discussing what the challenges are of honing the skill of writing about race and contributing to the production of knowledge that can aid in the creation, implementation and enforcement of effective Race Law interventions and policies. The series will also include discussions regarding the value of Critical Race Theory analysis to Race Law Public Intellectual writing.
