Huntley Pizzarelli

2025-2026 AmeriCorps VISTA Member & CLARO Coordinator

Huntley Pizzarelli is a NYC Consumer Advocacy Project Coordinator at the Feerick Center for Social Justice. Huntley graduated in May 2025 from the University of Richmond with a B.A. in PPEL (Political Science, Philosophy, Economics, and Law). She brings a unique interdisciplinary lens to consumer advocacy work. Her passion for advocacy was shaped through diverse community services experiences.

Having previously interned at the Feerick Center during the summer of 2024, she witnessed firsthand how legal barriers can perpetuate economic inequality. These advocacy experiences made the Feerick Center feel like the natural next step before law school, where she can deepen her understanding of how legal work directly impacts underserved communities while contributing meaningfully to consumer protection efforts.
