# Attorney Emeritus Program

The New York State Attorney Emeritus Program (“AEP”) is designed to facilitate pro bono services by senior attorneys. During the two-year registration period, Emeritus Attorney volunteers commit to serving 60 hours of unpaid civil legal assistance under the auspices of a qualified legal service provider, bar association, or court-sponsored volunteer lawyer program. Upon electing the Emeritus status, Attorney Emeritus volunteers are connected with AEP-approved legal services organizations or court-sponsored programs in need of pro bono lawyers.

To be eligible to serve as an Attorney Emeritus, individuals must be retired or active attorneys in good standing, who are at least 55 years of age, and have practiced law for a minimum of 10 years. Attorneys can get involved with the AEP by calling 877-800-0396 or by applying with the Program through the [online portal](https://www.nysattorneyemeritus.law/user/register/) and completing an online application. Additionally, attorneys who qualify and wish to join the AEP should select “Attorney Emeritus” as their registration status on their next biennial attorney registration form.
