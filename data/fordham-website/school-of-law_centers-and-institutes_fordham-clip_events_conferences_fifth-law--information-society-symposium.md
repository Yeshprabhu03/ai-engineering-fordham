# Fifth Law & Information Society Symposium

## March 25, 2011

## Mobile Devices, Location Technologies & Shifting Values

In celebration of CLIP’s Fifth Anniversary, this symposium explored emerging law and policy related to mobile devices, location technologies and shifting public values. Advances in information and network technologies have placed mobile computing at the forefront of the global information economy. The popularity of devices like smart phones and of applications providing location based services have led to an increase in information collection and information accessibility. At the same time, values and societal expectations with respect to key issues such as access to networks, use of content, and privacy are shifting. This symposium brought together thought-leaders and practitioners to address and assess policies and solutions for the cutting-edge issues that will affect the evolution of mobile computing.

-
Have mobile devices and location based services changed our values regarding privacy, data collection and data use? This panel explored the privacy concerns that arise as people begin turning over and technologies disclose more information in order to use mobile devices and LBS. What rights do individuals have in the data collected? What rights do people expect and are expectations changing as these services become more popular? What rights are granted/recognized internationally and how can compliance with local and international standards be assured? What rights should corporations ethically grant their users?
