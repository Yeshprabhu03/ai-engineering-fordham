# Fordham Law Roundtable Series: Privacy & Children's Educational Records

## October 14, 2010

The National Law Journal and Fordham Law School presented a roundtable on "Privacy and Children's Educational Records" with complimentary breakfast and free CLE credit. Panelists discussed the results and recommendations of a survey of all 50 states recently conducted by Fordham Law School's Center on Law and Information Policy, which found that state educational databases across the country ignore key privacy protections for the nation's K-12 children. The study found that personally identifiable data and sensitive personal information are often stored by state departments of education in electronic warehouses or for the states by third party vendors. These data warehouses typically lack adequate privacy protections, are often not compliant with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, and leave children unprotected from data misuse, improper data release and data breaches. The study provides recommendations for best practices and legislative reform to address these privacy problems.
