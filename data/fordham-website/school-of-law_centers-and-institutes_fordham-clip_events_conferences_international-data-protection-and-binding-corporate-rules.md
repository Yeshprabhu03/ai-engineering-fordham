# International Data Protection and Binding Corporate Rules

## November 13-24, 2006

CLIP hosted a two-day workshop on November 13 and 14, 2006 on international data protection and binding corporate rules. The workshop explored the use of Binding Corporate Rule as a solution for the adequate protection of personal information under European Directive 95/46/EC. The workshop brought together a select group of industry leaders, technologists, academic and policy leaders and government regulatory officials to engage in a constructive dialog to seek to clarify uncertainty surrounding the use of Binding Corporate Rules.
