# Privacy Rights & Wrongs

## Balancing Moral Priorities for the 21st Century

This multidisciplinary conference was co-sponsored by the Center for Ethics Education and Center on Law and Information Policy. The conference explored a number of issues related to the topic of privacy and privacy rights, especially in light of recent technological developments and current concerns about terror. In addition, this conference addressed the problem of defining and defending “privacy rights” within the context of varying legal, moral, and political discourses as well as the importance of understanding the value of privacy against the backdrop of other values and concerns, such as the doing of justice, the preserving of the common good, and the maintenance and fostering of personal accountability.
