# Second Law & Information Society Symposium

## May 29-30, 2008

## Enforcement, Compliance and Remedies in the Information Society

This symposium explored the enforcement of, compliance with and remedies flowing from the law in the information society. In 2005, Fordham hosted the first Law and Information Society Symposium to explore what law is or should be applicable in the information society. In this second symposium, we continued our exploration of the law by examining enforcement, compliance and remedies. The conference reviewed these aspects in four different substantive areas: international privacy; intellectual property; consumer protection; and data warehousing. These areas were selected because of their significance in the information society and because they are areas where regulation is currently evolving.

The areas were discussed as follows:

- International Privacy is discussed on Day 1, in Panels 1-2
- Intellectual Property is discussed on Day 1, in Panels 3-4
- Consumer Protection is discussed on Day 2, in Panels 5-6
- Data Warehousing is discussed on Day 2, in Panel 7

-
This panel explored the notice and take down process provided in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Panelist discussed how rights holders are using the process to enforce rights, how intermediaries are responding to notices and what impact the process has on users and alleged infringers. The panel discussed whether the process is both effective for rights holders and sufficiently protective for users. The panel also explored how filtering software affects the process.

This panel discussed the remedies available for online copyright infringement after the Supreme Court’s decision in MGM v. Grokster. Panelists generally discussed the trend of enforcing rights against intermediaries rather than direct infringers. They explored who rights holders can seek a remedy against after Grokster and what impact the Perfect 10 decision will have on the contributory liability analysis. The panel also considered whether the changing standards will lead to an increased level of responsibility placed on intermediaries.

Panelist considered how privacy policies are enforced and what challenges exist to enforcement with respect to data warehousing. They discussed whether consumers can or should be able to require the deletion of stored data and whether there should be opt-out options for users who do not want data regarding their use collected. Finally, they considered what independent action individuals can take to protect themselves and whether independent action is a good alternative to regulation and public enforcement.
