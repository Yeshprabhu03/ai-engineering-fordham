# Sixth Law and Information Society Symposium

## March 2, 2012

## Big Data, Big Issues

Over the past few years we have witnessed the growth of a new type of data analysis where computers are able to analyze and use large interconnected databases of information to make useful predictions. This new form of data processing, popularly referred to as “Big Data,” has both benefits and risks. The public and private sectors are able to use this information aggregation and analysis to create new helpful information sets, but the same data collection and processing also poses threats to individual privacy. This conference examined the rise of Big Data and considered how the law can address privacy concerns without hampering innovation.
