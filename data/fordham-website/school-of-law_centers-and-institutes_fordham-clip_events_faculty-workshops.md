# CLIP Faculty Workshops

CLIP initiated the Law and Information Society Faculty Workshop series in 2007 to provide a unique forum where faculty can receive input on their current work from the leading experts in the field. The format is distinctive because CLIP brings a small number of information law scholars from across the country together with the Fordham information law faculty and experts from other New York area schools to an informal, high-level discussion of the work-in-progress. The series seeks to explore major issues related to the role of law and technological developments in society.

### An Engineering Perspective on Protocol Layering

**Guest Scholar**

Christopher Yoo

Professor of Law

University of Pennsylvania Law School**Abstract**

The layered architecture of the Internet is often lauded as an important source of innovation. A review of both the engineering and management literature reveals that the relationship between protocol layering and innovation is more complex than this simple perspective suggests. As an initial matter, the existing architecture is only one of many possible protocol stacks. Indeed, many thought it would simply be a transitional step toward a different stack with different and greater functionality. Moreover, layering channels technology in a particular direction, facilitating innovations that are consistent with the existing design hierarchy while impeding innovations that require a different architecture. Indeed, the engineering literature is replete with articles recognizing that the Internet is not well designed to support many features that end users now demand, such as security, mobility, multicasting, and multihoming. As a result, the National Science Foundation and the European Commission are sponsoring “clean slate” research designed to help the network overcome the obstacles that are locking it into place.Interestingly, the fact that network providers and content/application providers offer complementary services necessarily means that the relationship between them possesses both cooperative and noncooperative elements. On the one hand, they have the incentive to cooperate to jointly maximize surplus. On the other hand, they simultaneously have the noncooperative incentive to claim the largest proportion of that surplus possible. The literature on New Institutional Economics suggest that parties in such an industry will attempt to manage this process by entering into strategic partnerships that can be quite complex. In addition, they may compete by trying to invade each other’s territory, as exemplified by the growing rivalry between Apple and Google. Rather than use regulation to lock the current layered stack into place, the engineering literature instead suggests that policymakers should “design for tussle” in ways that allows the network architecture to continue to develop and evolve.

### Telecommunications Privacy Law in the US and Germany

**Guest Scholar**

Paul Schwartz

Professor of Law

University of California, Berkeley School of Law**Abstract**

Did everything change on 9/11? In this presentation, Professor Schwartz will discuss selected topics concerning the comparative regulation of telecommunications surveillance in German and U.S. law. He will discuss important recent German constitutional law opinions, including decisions that identify a new right to the integrity and security of computers and that places limits on the storage by companies of telecommunications information. Important legislation in Germany has also altered the previous organization of the intelligence services in Germany and given greater power to the Federal Criminal Police Office (the/Bundeskriminalamt). Important points of comparisons on the U.S.-side will be discussed.**Participants**

### Applying the Fourth Amendment to the Internet

**Guest Scholar**

Orin Kerr

Professor of Law

George Washington University Law School**Abstract**

This article offers a general framework for applying the Fourth Amendment to the Internet. It assumes that courts will seek a technology-neutral translation of Fourth Amendment principles from physical space to cyberspace, and it considers what new distinctions in the online setting can reflect the function of Fourth Amendment protections designed for the physical world. It reaches two major conclusions. First, the traditional physical distinction between inside and outside should be replaced with the online distinction between content and non-content information. Second, courts should require a search warrant that is particularized to individuals rather than Internet accounts to collect the contents of protected Internet communications. These two principles point the way to a technology-neutral translation of the Fourth Amendment from physical space to cyberspace.**Participants**

### Cyber Civil Rights

**Guest Scholar**

Danielle Keats Citron

Professor of Law

University of Maryland School of Law**Abstract**

Social networking sites and blogs have increasingly become breeding grounds for anonymous online groups that attack women, people of color, and members of other traditionally disadvantaged groups. These destructive groups target individuals with defamation, threats of violence, and technology-based attacks that silence victims and concomitantly destroy their privacy. Victims go offline or assume pseudonyms to prevent future attacks, impoverishing online dialogue and depriving victims of the social and economic opportunities associated with a vibrant online presence. Attackers manipulate search engines to reproduce their lies and threats for employers and clients to see, creating digital “scarlet letters” that ruin reputations.Today’s cyber attack groups update a history of anonymous mobs coming together to victimize and subjugate vulnerable people. The social science literature identifies conditions that magnify dangerous group behavior and those that tend to defuse it. Unfortunately, Web 2.0 technologies accelerate mob behavior. With little reason to expect self-correction of this intimidation of vulnerable individuals, the law must respond.

General criminal statutes and tort law proscribe much of the mobs’ destructive behavior, but the harm ty inflict also ought to be understood and addressed as civil rights violations. Civil rights suits reach the societal harm that would otherwise go unaddressed and would play a crucial expressive role. Acting against these attacks does not offend First Amendment principles when they consist of defamation, true threats, intentional infliction of emotional distress, technological sabotage, and bias-motivated abuse aimed to interfere with a victim’s employment opportunities. To the contrary, it helps preserve vibrant online dialogue and promote a culture of political, social, and economic equality.

### Rethinking Free Speech Liability

**Guest Scholars**

Daniel J. Solove

Professor of Law

George Washington University Law SchoolNeil M. Richards


Professor of Law

Washington University School of Law**Abstract**

One of the most important and unresolved riddles of First Amendment jurisprudence involves when civil liability for speech will trigger First Amendment protections. Since the landmark case of New York Times v. Sullivan, the First Amendment applies to tort liability for various forms of speech, including defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and invasion of privacy. Hardly anybody contests this rule as a normative matter. In other contexts, however, the First Amendment is almost totally inapplicable to liability for speech. For example, since Cohen v. Cowles, there is no First Amendment liability for speech restricted by generally applicable rules such as promissory estoppel and contract. These two strands of First Amendment jurisprudence have existed for decades without question. But when examined more closely, these two strands are in severe conflict with each other. The law imposes numerous duties of confidentiality. Professionals such as doctors, lawyers, and bankers have duties to maintain the confidentiality of their patients' or clients' information. Employees frequently agree to keep their company's data confidential. Various statutes require that the holders of personal information maintain confidentiality. People routinely make agreements not to disclose another's personal information. Does the First Amendment apply to these duties of confidentiality? Should it? The law currently supplies two directly opposite conclusions. In this article, Daniel J. Solove and Neil M. Richards contend that the existing doctrine and theories are inadequate to resolve the difficult free speech-confidentiality riddle. They propose a way to answer this intractable conundrum.**Participants**
