# About the Institute on Religion, Law and Lawyer's Work

At a time when the role of religion in professional life and in the public square is hotly debated, the Institute aims to promote an open, positive and constructive dialogue on issues relating to religion and law.

The Institute's events run along three tracks: interfaith, faith-specific, and international. Its publications focus on how religious perspectives may inform legal practice and legal education. For students, the Institute supports the development of courses that probe how religious teachings and values may be applied to various areas of legal theory and practice. For faculty, the Institute has developed a number of resources for reflection on religious values and legal education. The Institute also serves as a clearinghouse for research and resources on religious lawyering.

Recognizing the cultural and religious differences that permeate work environments and our culture as a whole, how can one affirm one's own identity and the truth about one's own religion, and still be in open and sincere conversation with others who hold a different set of beliefs?
