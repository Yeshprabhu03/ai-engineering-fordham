# Institute on Religion, Law and Lawyer's Work Programs

The Institute on Religion, Law & Lawyer's Work provides a forum for lawyers and students to reflect on Religious Values and the Practice of Law. Lectures gathers practicing attorneys and judges in the New York metropolitan area to discuss the key issues and concerns they face in their efforts to reconcile their professional lives with their faith, and how they can work together from different religious in order to foster the common good.

The Institute's programs run along three tracks.

The Institute organizes the Faculty Colloquia on Jesuit Values and the Law School and also offers its collaboration for the multi-school Catholic Legal Thought Conference, a summer institute for law professors.
