Here some of the questions discussed: "Conflict cannot be ignored or concealed. It has to be faced." - how a lawyer helps their clients when conflict arises? and how can we avoid the temptation of becoming "prisoners of conflict"? "Globalization and localization" - How this innate tension connects with our work as lawyers? How a life of a community connects with my Law School community and my legal career?"

Lawyers as Changemakers: Addressing the Agunah Issue in U.S. Civil Practice

One of the more painful issues in the area of family law, both in the USA and internationally, is the plight of the Jewish Agunah, who has been refused a bill of divorce (

*get*). Many Jewish women over the world spend years seeking to obtain a*get*from a recalcitrant husband. The plight of the modern Agunah has exercised both Jewish and secular legal systems, and various means have been devised to alleviate it.This project aims to create a forum where all the different voices that are prepared to listen to each other can meet and discuss new ideas.

-
On February 13, 2020, the Agunah panel discussion concentrated on the particular problem of Jewish women whose husbands refuse to grant them a bill of divorce (Get) and who are, therefore, unable to remarry under Jewish law. The discussion aimed to highlight the problem's scope and raise awareness of current practices available for its amelioration.

On January 12, 2015 Rabbi Blanchard presented how legal decisions often aim at certainty and sometimes even at finality. Most decisions however will settle for good arguments that provide predictability within the legal system, learning to tolerate “seeing through a glass darkly”. In contrast, the Jewish legal system as a whole and over time appreciates and values multiple positions and approaches to both cases and issues of law. This lecture explored this open and tolerant quality of Jewish legal texts in civil, family and religious law.
