# Cathonomics

## March 2, 2023

We fall short of what other advanced nations have provided in care for basic needs – health and support for families. The challenges of race, resentment, and refugees are central concerns today. The flood of climate, economic, and political refugees at our southern border leads us to ask, how can the Catholic social tradition guide us?

Has the Church in the U.S. drifted so far from its mission, and lost its cultural eminence that its deeply humanist tradition - rooted in concern for others - has lost the power to reform the public dialog?
