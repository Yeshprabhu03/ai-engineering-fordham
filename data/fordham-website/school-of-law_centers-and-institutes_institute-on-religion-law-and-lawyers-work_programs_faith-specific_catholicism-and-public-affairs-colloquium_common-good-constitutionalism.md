# Common Good Constitutionalism

## May 10, 2022

Americans’ understanding of their Constitution and legal tradition has been dominated in recent decades by two contested themes: the 'originalism' of conservatives and the 'living constitutionalism' of progressives. Is it time to look for an alternative? Harvard Law School’s [Adrian Vermeule](https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10919/Vermeule) says the alternative underlies the American legal tradition. He calls for 'common good constitutionalism' which draws on “the classical synthesis of Roman law, canon law, and local civil law.”
