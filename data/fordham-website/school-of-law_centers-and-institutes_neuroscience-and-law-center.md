**How Neuroscience Can Make Criminal Justice More Effective, Efficient, and Fair**The use of neuroscientific evidence in criminal courts is relevant to public policy regarding mass incarceration and criminal justice system reform. The term “neuroscience” can refer to any information about the brain and nervous system based on measurement techniques such as imaging tests (e.g., the MRI) and non-imaging tests (e.g., neuropsychological assessments). The Fordham University School of Law’s Neuroscience and Law Center seeks to incorporate recent advances in neuroscience to make courts more effective, efficient, and fair.

The Center has gathered an original database of every criminal case (from the Lexis and Westlaw legal databases) that addresses neuroscientific evidence in any capacity over the two decades between 1992 and 2012. This large-scale empirical research study, known as the Neuroscience Study, reveals a nuanced and multifaceted assessment of how and why criminal courts rely on neuroscientific evidence. By offering multiple perspectives on the role of neuroscience in the American legal system, the Neuroscience Study provides an unprecedented opportunity to change how this country responds to crime.

Since 2015, the Center’s database has generated many articles in legal journals and other publications, which are listed below. Additional research is continuing at full speed.

*Changing Law’s Mind: How Neuroscience Can Help Us Punish Criminals More Fairly and Effectively*, to be published by Oxford University Press. The book will provide readers with a foundation in both the legal doctrine and neuroscience and then use that bridge to question the criminal law’s underlying principles and practice. Such an examination will follow a case from its start to finish after a defendant is sentenced. The intersection of law and neuroscience is a thriving topic; this book will stand out by providing pioneering real-world insights across a broad spectrum of topics drawn from a detailed analysis of the Study’s vast dataset. The findings revealed in*Changing Law’s Mind*have implications that extend beyond the legal system altogether. -
**Science, Law, and Lethal Injection**Lethal injection, the most common method of execution in the United States, is at an impasse. Despite three United States Supreme Court decisions upholding particular lethal injection protocols, inmates continue to challenge this method on the grounds that it is inhumane and unconstitutional, and states continue to cling to scientifically uninformed procedures to ensure the death penalty's survival generally. Many of the current lethal injection challenges pertain to questions concerning an inmate's degree of conscious suffering during the drug-injection process, especially in light of the extraordinary amount of experimentation that states have engaged in over the decades.

Professor Denno writes, testifies, and conducts research on lethal injection. She started her work in the early 1990s, yet her efforts have continued unabated over the years. Indeed, the problems associated with lethal injection litigation fit squarely within the Neuroscience and Law's focus on matters about the brain and nervous system.

The following list of publications (from 1994-2020) documents Professor Denno's past and ongoing study of lethal injection issues. Her curriculum vitae (posted on her Fordham Law School website) provides more details on her expert testimony and other kinds of death-penalty-related activities.
