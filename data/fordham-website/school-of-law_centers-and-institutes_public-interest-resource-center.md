# Public Interest Resource Center

## Fordham Law School's mission is to educate attorneys to work "in the service of others."

Public service has long been a tradition at Fordham Law School and is expressed today through the activities of nearly 500 Fordham Law students who participate annually in the public service work of the Public Interest Resource Center.

The Public Interest Resource Center (PIRC)

- is the hub of public interest legal work at Fordham Law. Students interested in public interest work should connect with PIRC.
- is the place where Fordham Law students can devote their passions, interests, and skills to pro bono, public service and community service work from their first week in law school–through participation in our dynamic
[PIRC Student Groups](/school-of-law/centers-and-institutes/public-interest-resource-center/pirc-student-groups/).
