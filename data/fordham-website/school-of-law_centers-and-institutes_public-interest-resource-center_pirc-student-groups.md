# PIRC Student Groups

We are the home of dynamic student-initiated, student-run pro bono, public service, and community service projects. Our student groups are involved in a broad range of advocacy, assistance, and education directly addressing issues such as criminal justice, domestic violence, the environment, homelessness and housing, human rights, immigration, unemployment, and work with youth. We are a place where the passion, talents, skills, energy and creativity of Fordham Law students make a real difference—from the first week of entering law school.
