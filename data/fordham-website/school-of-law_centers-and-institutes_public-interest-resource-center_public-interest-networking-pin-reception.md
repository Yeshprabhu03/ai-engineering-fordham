# Public Interest Networking (PIN) Reception

![Fordham Law School Public Interest Networking Reception](/media/home/schools/school-of-law/PIN-Reception.jpg)



Goal of the Reception

The goal of the annual PIN Reception is to introduce law students to and highlight the outstanding and rewarding public service work of non-profit organizations, government agencies, and private public interest law firms. The PIN Reception also provides an opportunity for law students to meet attorneys, as well as other students, who share their interests.

There is no expectation that employers will extend offers of employment. In fact, students are informed that employers will *not* be arranging job interviews and they are instructed not to bring resumes. Instead, we encourage employers to post openings for internships and permanent positions on PSJD.org, the leading online resource for public service careers.

**Format of the Reception**

The PIN Reception presents a rare opportunity for students and employers to meet and connect in person. The format of the PIN Reception is fairly informal and set up for “table talks” between students and employers.

This annual reception has been highly successful in the past. The event aims to build on that success and create another outstanding reception.
