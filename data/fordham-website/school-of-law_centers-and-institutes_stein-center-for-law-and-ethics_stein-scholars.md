# Stein Scholars Program

The Public Interest Resource Center with the Stein Center, oversees the student driven Stein Scholars Program, an academic and service program in which selected students participate through all three years of law school, and throughout their career.

Deliberately chosen from diverse backgrounds, Stein Scholars community reflects the broad spectrum of culture, education, and experience that is the United States today. This diversity is one of the strengths of the program, enabling students to learn from each other, and to appreciate differing views, as they pursue common goals.
