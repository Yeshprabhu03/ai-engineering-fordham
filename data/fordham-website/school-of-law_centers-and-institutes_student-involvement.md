Launched in 2019, the CJEC has a dual mandate: judicial engagement and clerkship support. Its


creation represents the law school’s increased commitment to strengthening our relationship with

the judiciary. The Center is an active intellectual hub for students, alumni, faculty and the

community to learn from and engage with the judiciary.Judicial Engagement

The Center’s judicial engagement mandate is a reflection of our desire to increase collaborations between the Law School and the judiciary with a goal of instilling in our students a broader appreciation for the importance of civics and the rule of law. The CJEC is honored to collaborate with the Commercial Division Advisory Council to host the Institute on Complex Commercial Litigation at the Law School (in November 2023). The Institute welcomes judges from the Appellate Division and Commercial Division for training on issues related to commercial litigation.

Clerkship Support

Equally central to the mission is developing a space to foster community and build engagement among our cohort of alumni clerks, judges and students to promote a clerkship-oriented culture. The CJEC, working with members of the Faculty Clerkship Committee, provides support to JD students and alumni who choose to pursue post-graduate judicial clerkships at the federal and state levels. Our alumni clerk cohort continues to benefit from enhanced post-clerkship career support.

Opportunities for Student Involvement

Fordham Law students can participate in public lectures, roundtable discussions, and clerkship-focused events organized and sponsored by the CJEC. Our Jurist in Residence, Judicial Day in Residence and View from Chambers events invite members of the judiciary to engage directly with students to educate them on substantive areas of the law, co-teach classes and provide insight into types of courts/judges and their role in the judicial system.

The CJEC welcomes inquiries from, and collaboration with, other law school centers and student organizations that are interested in presenting programs on topics relating to the judiciary and/or welcoming judges to the school. On our Clerkship side, beginning with the 2020-2021 academic year, the CJEC created a Peer Clerkship Council composed of 3LD/4LE students who worked closely with the Center to secure their clerkships.

At the

[National Center for Access to Justice](https://ncaj.org/)(NCAJ), we use data and research to promote policies that increase access to justice: the right to be heard and to obtain a fair result under the law. Everyone deserves access to justice, but it is unavailable to millions for the most basic human needs such as keeping a home, holding a family together, protecting income and savings, and securing food, health, safety and basic liberty. Barriers and bad actors put it out of reach in civil and criminal matters for people unaware of their rights, unable to qualify for free legal aid or pay for private counsel, and/or unable to overcome discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, disability, language, and more. We need access to justice because we (or those we care about) may face crises in our lives, but also because fairness matters to all of us, and because the essential stability of our society – the rule of law and reliability of our democracy – depends on justice for all.Opportunities for Student Involvement

We invite students to join our research and our advocacy. We are expanding NCAJ's Justice Index to benchmark and promote the progress of the 50 states in adopting laws that protect fairness in debt collection proceedings in the state courts. We are also using our findings from Justice Index 2021 to reduce government reliance on court-imposed fines and fees that fall hardest on low-income communities and communities of color. Law students may join in NCAJ's work through independent study; summer, school-year and post-graduate internships; research assistant roles; conferences and special events (including with Fordham student journals and the

[A2J Initiative](/school-of-law/life-at-fordham-law/access-to-justice-a2j-initiative/)at Fordham Law). NCAJ also co-teaches the Access to Justice Seminar, a course that uses access to justice issues as a lens to explore how to drive societal change.**Contact:**[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3c525f5d567c5a534e58545d5112595849) -
