**Evening Division**The course of study for the degree of Doctor of Law extends over four academic years in the Evening Division and equals that required in the three years of the Day Division. All required courses are taught by the full-time faculty and Evening students are subject to the same grading system as the Day students. In addition to their studies, a majority of students enrolled in the Evening Division maintain full-time employment.

**JD Program Grading System**Student grades are calculated on both a letter and a numerical scale. There are no official class standings. At the end of the 2024-2025 academic year, a student who attained a true weighted average of 3.538 or better made Dean's List for that year. Students may not round up to compute Dean's List, awards, or to associate their GPAs to an Approximate Class Standings benchmark, but they may otherwise round to two decimal places.
