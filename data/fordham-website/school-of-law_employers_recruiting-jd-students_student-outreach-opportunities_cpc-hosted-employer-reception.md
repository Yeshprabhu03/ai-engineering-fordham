# CPC-Hosted Employer Reception

For many years, early in each spring semester, the Career Planning Center has hosted on-campus Employer Receptions to introduce our new 1L class to employers who will be recruiting them for summer positions.

This year, we will be hosting the CPC-Hosted Employer Reception in November 2025, rather than in January as in years past, to reflect the accelerated recruiting timeline that has been adopted by so many employers.

**Date**: November 5, 2025**Time**: 4:15 PM - 6:15 PM

Rather than hosting two receptions, as we had in the past, we will host just one. However, a revised layout will allow us to accommodate just as many employers as we did in past years. As usual, the Reception will be held in the Conference Space on the 2nd Floor of the Law School building (150 West 62nd Street).

This semester, there will be no catering fee (nor any other fee) for employers participating in these receptions.

Participating employers are welcome to have up to 4 representative attend the Reception at any one time.

Employers also are invited to bring marketing materials to display on their table. We invite you to highlight your summer opportunities as well as any initiatives that foster community and culture, including inclusion and belonging, employee resource groups, wellness and sustainability programs, volunteer and pro bono engagement, and other efforts that enrich the workplace experience

Employers may also bring a poster/easel. There will also be a Raffle for students at each Reception; employers are welcome to participate in the Raffle by providing a giveaway that can be offered as a prize.

### Why participate in the Raffle?

The purpose of the Raffle is not to provide the students with prizes. Rather, the purpose of the Raffle is to help break the ice. By participating in the Raffle, you make it easier for students to approach your representatives at the Reception and initiate a conversation.

Employers who participate in the Raffle will be provided with a fishbowl and raffle-entry cards. In order to enter the Raffle to "win" your donated item, students will have to enter their contact information on the cards and drop them into your fishbowl. At the end of the Reception, you will: choose a winner from the fishbowl, provide the name of the winner to a member of our staff, who will notify the student, and take all the raffle cards back to your office, thereby giving you the contact information of all the students you spoke with at the Reception.

** LOTTERY**: If the total number of interested employers exceeds the capacity of the space, the Career Planning Center will conduct a lottery to determine which of the interested employers will attend the Reception. Employers interested in attending the Reception should complete
