# Distribution of Marketing Materials & Contacting Students

There are a number of ways for employers to disseminate information to Fordham students.

Employer Profile

We ask that you place as much detailed information as possible into your Employer Profile on Symplicity - including information addressed specifically to Fordham students. The profile is an excellent place to put letters to students (including letters from hiring partners or Fordham alumni at your organization), as well as firm facts. Moreover, Symplicity now allows you to upload documents and attach them to your profile. Students have told us that this is an easy and convenient way for them to research employers.

Student Contact List

Students may consent to disclosure of their contact information to employers who request it. Employers who request such information will receive a mailing list containing the names, class years, and email addresses of the students who have consented to inclusion on the list. Thereafter, you may email those students directly if you wish to send them marketing materials (copying us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3457554651514647745855431a525b46505c55591a515041), on any such emails sent to our students). Please contact Mitchell Weitz, Senior Manager, Employer Relations & Legal Recruiting ([[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3a4d5f534e407a565b4d145c55485e525b57145f5e4f) or 212-636-7603) if you would like more information on this option.

Student Organizations

Fordham Law School has a tradition of active student involvement in journals, moot court and organizations. These activities provide our students with substantial opportunities to gain leadership, research, writing, oral advocacy and other skills while in school. Employers are encouraged to contact student organizations directly to co-sponsor programs and other activities. The [Student Groups page](/school-of-law/life-at-fordham-law/student-organizations/) on this website lists all such groups and contains links to contact information for each one.
