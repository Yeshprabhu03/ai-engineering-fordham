# Volunteer to Assist a Student Competition Team

There are many opportunities for employers to support students and student organizations by volunteering their time with our student competition teams:

*(a) Brendan Moore Trial Advocacy*

The Brendan Moore Trial Advocacy Center is dedicated to fostering the education of law students in the world of trial advocacy. Each year, the Center sends Fordham students around the country to compete at national trial competitions. Under the guidance of practicing trial attorneys, these students devote a great deal of their time and effort to prepare for these competitions. Firms who wish to help are invited to sponsor practice trials at their offices, send experienced attorneys to judge practice rounds at Fordham, or even sponsor competition teams. If you wish to help, please contact the Center at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#385557574a5d595c4e575b594c5d4b785f55595154165b5755).

*(b) Moot Court*

Moot Court is Fordham’s appellate advocacy program. Moot Court hosts four competitions each year: two intraschool competitions to determine which 2L students will be invited to join the Moot Court Board, and two interschool competitions. The intraschool competitions, Mulligan and Wormser, are held in June/July and October/November, respectively. Since each of the multiple rounds of the competitions require a panel of three judges, Mulligan and Wormser offer both Fordham alumni and local practitioners a significant and enjoyable opportunity for involvement. Practitioners are eligible to receive CLE credit for their involvement. For more information about these and other volunteer opportunities, please contact the Moot Court Program at 212-636-6882 or via email at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e28f8d8d96818d979096a28e8395cc848d90868a838fcc878697).

*(c) Dispute Resolution Society*

The Dispute Resolution Society comprises students who compete in regional, national and international competitions in negotiation, mediation and arbitration. Each year the DRS hosts three events with sponsorship opportunities: (i) the leading Pre-moot for the Willem C. Vis Arbitration competition; (ii) a symposium each fall in which leading dispute resolution scholars join us as speakers or attendees; and (iii) a year-end dinner where Fordham deans, professors, distinguished alumni and DRS members celebrate the year's accomplishments. Each event offers opportunities for spotlighting your organization, including sponsoring the event and sponsoring a particular award.
