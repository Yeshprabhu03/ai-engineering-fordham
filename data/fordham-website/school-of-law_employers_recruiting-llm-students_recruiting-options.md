# Recruiting Options

The Graduate Professional Development Program (GPDP) aims to provide the highest level of service to employers interested in connecting with our LLM students. LLM recruiting is handled separately from JD recruiting at Fordham Law School. The only exception is for job postings through our job bank, which is maintained by the Fordham Law School Career Planning Center and can be accessed by both LLM and JD students and alumni.

We are pleased to provide the highest level of support to employers who wish to connect with our LLM students and alumni.

We have great flexibility and are delighted to work with individual employers to formulate a customized recruitment strategy that meets their particular needs.

We can arrange for job postings to be listed on our Symplicity database. Job postings on the Symplicity database are accessible to both JD and LLM students and alumni. This database is maintained by the Career Planning Center at Fordham Law School. We can also send targeted postings to students who have received their primary education in a particular country or region or to students who have specific language skills.
