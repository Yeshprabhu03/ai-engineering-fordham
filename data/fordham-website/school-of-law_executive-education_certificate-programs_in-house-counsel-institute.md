## Pathways to Excellence: Leadership for In-House Counsel

**Fordham Law School and DLA Piper**

Are you a relatively new in-house attorney seeking insights on how to navigate the challenges of in-house practice? Are you an experienced in-house attorney looking to advance your role as a business partner? Are you currently in private practice looking to transition into an in-house role?

Fordham Law School and DLA Piper are developing a program that will provide you with the tools to be a strategic and impactful leader in your organization. It will enable you to serve your company with distinction through legal leadership, innovative problem-solving, and strategic vision.

We have convened a prestigious board of advisors who serve or have served as high-level in-house counsel of major organizations to steer us in building this program and developing a panel of outstanding speakers with vast in-house experience.

There will be numerous opportunities to meet online and in-person to network and discuss issues related to the work of in-house counsel. Additionally, participants who meet the attendance requirements will receive a completion certificate at the end of the program.
