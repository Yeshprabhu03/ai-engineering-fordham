*"The best part of this course was being taught by law school professors. I had a real feeling of what law school entails by their diverse methods of teaching. Their stories were great, and they had fantastic advice for us. The course subject matters gave me clarity about the law and how law school teaches it. *

*That some of the law professors, to whom I reached out, also took the time to talk with me outside of class has left a lasting impression about the high quality of Fordham Law."*
