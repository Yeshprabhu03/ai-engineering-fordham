# ELC Client Information

Due to limited capacity, we give preference to for-profit and nonprofit enterprises that are either or both:

- Social ventures that seek to create positive change in society
- Companies founded by low-to-moderate income entrepreneurs

We also select clients based on their ability to provide diverse types of transactional law experience to students.

After you apply, if your needs align well with the clinic and its capacity to provide legal services, you will be contacted for more information about your business and legal needs, and to review next steps. Please note that you will only receive notification if you are selected to become a client. Generally, new client applications are evaluated and must be received prior to the start of each semester, in August and January.
