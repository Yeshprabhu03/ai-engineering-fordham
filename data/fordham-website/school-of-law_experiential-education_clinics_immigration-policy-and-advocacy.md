## Advancing Justice and Immigration Reform

Working with local, regional, and national immigration community and advocacy organizations, students in the Immigration Policy and Advocacy Clinic will engage in efforts aimed at advancing justice and immigration reform through policy development and advocacy, organizing, public education, and legislative campaigns. Students will develop lawyering and advocacy skills, including persuasive oral and written communication, research, legal reasoning, creative problem-solving, and effective collaboration.

In the seminar and through project work, students will, among other things, examine immigration laws and policies, dissect barriers to reform, and explore potential ways to contribute to effective immigration reform. Work may entail gathering data and producing policy reports, developing resources for immigrants, their families, and allies, and collaborating with a variety of stakeholders interested and engaged in immigrant justice and advocacy.
