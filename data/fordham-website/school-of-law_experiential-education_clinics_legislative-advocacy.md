# Legislative Advocacy

## Advocate to enact New York State and City laws to promote civil rights and protect the disenfranchised.

Working with grassroots groups and legal advocacy organizations, Fordham's Legislative Advocacy Clinic students draft legislative proposals, reports, and advocacy materials. Students meet with legislators and their staffers and conduct legal and social justice research.

Students collaborate with dynamic social change leaders from across the State and City, working with diverse coalitions to achieve our clients' goals.

**Clinic students lobby for key issues affecting the lives of countless New Yorkers, including:**

- Lowering the State’s 9% judgement interest rate on consumer debt to 2%, providing New Yorkers with an opportunity to get out of debt
- Working to protect the rights of intersex individuals
- Seeking to decriminalize voluntary sex work


With its diversity and depth of issues, heterogeneous communities, vibrant politics, New York is the perfect place to learn to be a legislative advocate. The skills you learn and the experiences you have will prepare you to be an effective attorney– whether you pursue a career in legislative advocacy, litigation, or virtually any other practice area.

Without the Legislative and Policy Advocacy Clinic, I would not be where I am today. Both the practical and legal skills I developed during my time in the clinic were invaluable in beginning my career in government and policy, and continue to be relevant years later.
