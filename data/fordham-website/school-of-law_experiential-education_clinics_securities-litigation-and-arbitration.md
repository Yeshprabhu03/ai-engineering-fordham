# Securities Litigation and Arbitration

Learn how to represent clients effectively while learning valuable skills and improving your judgment and decision making.

The clinic provides legal representation to investors who have limited resources. Cases are typically brought against brokers for making unsuitable investments, trading excessively just to earn commissions, and making material representations.

Students are responsible for: conducting client interviews, fact investigation, discovery, and settlement negotiations; working with expert witnesses; making opening statements and closing arguments; conducting direct and cross examinations of witnesses at arbitrations; communicating with arbitrators orally and in writing; and advocating at mediations.

By the end of the semester, students leave the clinic having gained tremendous practical experience, a greater understanding of securities disputes, and an ability to make challenging strategic decisions.

*Under the close supervision of Professor Paul Radvany, a former Deputy Chief of the Criminal Division for the United States Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, students assume direct responsibility for every stage of their client's case. *
