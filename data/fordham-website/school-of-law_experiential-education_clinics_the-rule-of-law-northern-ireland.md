# The Rule of Law: Northern Ireland

## Nationhood is dynamic, and changes to nationhood that run afoul of the Rule of Law can threaten its very existence.

In its initial iteration, the *new* Rule of Law Clinic will explore how the discussion around the future of Northern Ireland, post-Brexit, should be grounded in the rule of law. The clinic will issue policy reports assessing legal and governance issues such as analyzing possible constitutional arrangements, given the relationships Northern Ireland has with the UK, Republic of Ireland, and EU and the existing arrangements governing those arrangements, including the Good Friday Agreement.

Students' fieldwork will include fact-finding through interviews with experts and stakeholders in Northern Ireland, the UK more generally, Ireland, the EU and the US. The seminar will serve as a platform for discussing the clinic's projects, furthering understanding of the issues involved, and developing the lawyering skills essential to the clinic's work in the international arena.
