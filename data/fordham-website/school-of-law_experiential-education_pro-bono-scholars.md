# Pro Bono Scholars Program

Make a difference in your final semester at Fordham Law. Help others get legal recourse and help yourself get ahead.

Through the [Pro Bono Scholars Progam](https://my.lawnet.fordham.edu/sites/probonoscholarsprogram), you will devote your last law school semester to pro bono legal work on behalf of low income and indigent people. Working with one of Fordham’s clinics or a select legal services provider, you will receive vital, real-life legal practice while also learning the importance of serving clients with limited means.

While you help others, you’ll also be helping yourself get a jump-start on your legal career. The program allows you to take the New York bar exam early: in February of your final year of study. Once you pass, you’ll be admitted to practice right after graduation.
