# Dylan Yaeger

## Adjunct Professor of Law

Dylan Yaeger is a lawyer, scholar, and legal theorist, whose research interests center around the intersectionality of law and culture, specifically how critical theories engaging class, race, gender, and sexuality are implicated in the construction of legal pedagogy and interpretation. Dylan’s work critiques the law’s normative structure by drawing on a diverse array of tools from the larger cultural environment and challenges some of the doctrinal foundations of legal decision-making that cloak the law in objectivity and reify the boundary between hard and soft law. Dylan is pursuing a doctorate at Fordham University School of Law. A native of Montreal, Dylan has an undergraduate degree with honors in Political Science from Concordia University, where he graduated on the Dean’s honor list.

He received his JD from Osgoode Hall Law School, which he attended on a millennium scholarship. Upon graduation he received the Benjamin Laufer prize for the student with the highest standing in International Law. Dylan received his LLB from the University of Montreal which he attended on a Department of Justice Common Law / Droit Civil Scholarship. He went on to receive his LLM from New York University’s School of Law where he served as a student advocate in the human rights legal clinic. Prior to beginning his doctorate studies Dylan served as an academic career research fellow at NYU law. Dylan practiced corporate litigation in Montreal, and has consulted for Norton Rose Fulbright and McCarter English on international matters, in New York City. He has worked at the International Peace Institute and as a regional desk officer on the Pennsylvania Voter Protection team for the Obama campaign in 2008. He is licensed to practice law in New York and Quebec.
