## Adjunct Professor of Law

Kim Diamond is a recognized leader in the legal, energy, and environmental communities areas and is a thought leader in the renewable energy, smart cities, and energy policy areas.

As a practicing attorney, Kim’s experience spans many sectors and practice areas. At the confluence of law, science, technology, and energy policy, Kim is involved in cutting-edge initiatives relating to offshore wind, benchmarking commercial buildings’ energy efficiency and water usage, electric vehicles, solar energy, and various other clean energy sectors. Her experience in the private sector includes being a transactional lawyer with a background in securitization, structured finance, and secured lending. She has worked at large international law firms, representing domestic and international commercial banks, financial institutions, asset managers, funds, sponsors, large corporations, and others in numerous complex multi-million and multi-billion dollar CMBS, ABS, and RMBS securitizations, as well as structured finance, leveraged finance, and other complex financing transactions (including CLOs) in the public and private markets, both domestically and internationally. She also possesses in-house as well as government experience, serving as in-house counsel at Credit Suisse, a global investment bank, where she covered the Fixed Income desk, and serving in state government with respect to the launch of novel programs.

Demonstrating how teaching takes place both inside and outside the classroom, Kim has taught law students and practicing lawyers alike, from classroom, law firm, and podium settings. For roughly a decade, Kim has enthusiastically taught courses such as Energy Law to upper-level Fordham Law School JD and LLM students. Her course format has enabled students located in the U.S. and abroad to simultaneously attend her class sessions, offering students in her course a platform facilitating a truly global exchange of ideas. In private law firm practice, she has mentored teams of law students from NYU Law School’s Law and Social Entrepreneurship Association throughout the course of their representation of small business owners from Rising Tide Capital’s entrepreneurs program for start-up companies. She regularly participates as a speaker in national and international conferences, sharing her knowledge on cutting-edge topics with the broader legal, renewable energy, and environmental communities. Venues at which she has spoken include the British Consulate General – New York, Columbia Business School, and the American Clean Power Association’s (f/k/a American Wind Energy Association’s) WINDPOWER Conferences.

With respect to scholarship, Kim regularly publishes on offshore wind, onshore wind, solar power, smart cities, green building climate change, energy efficiency, finance, and other topics. Her articles have appeared in prestigious law reviews, journals, and trade publications. The United States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit, among other places, has cited her work. Additionally, the first legal textbook of its kind on renewable energy law, *Renewable Energy Law, Policy and Practice* (Troy A. Rule, 2018), includes a selection from one of her recent law review articles on wind rights and wake effect impacts.

Kim has held various senior leadership positions within the clean energy sector. Within the American Bar Association’s (ABA’s) Section of Environment, Energy & Resources, she served as Chair of the award-winning Renewable, Alternative, and Distributed Energy Resources (RADER) Committee as well as Co-Chair of the Special Committee on Congressional Relations. She also served as Chair of the Tri-State Area Chapter of Women of Renewable Industries and Sustainable Energy (WRISE, f/k/a Women of Wind Energy). On the local level, Kim is a Co-Chair of her local environmental commission and is a former Chair of the regional “hub” of environmental commissioners and Green Team members from municipalities throughout her county.

Kim’s accomplishments have been recognized on international, national, and statewide levels. Internationally, she has been recognized on United Kingdom-based A Word About Wind’s *Legal Power List 2016* as one of the Top 100 lawyers working in wind globally. Nationally, in addition to leading her ABA RADER Committee to win several awards, she herself received WRISE’s Mentor of the Year Award during this award’s inaugural year, for her role as a mentor to a renewable energy finance graduate student located in the Netherlands. On the state level, Sustainable Jersey named Kim as a statewide “Sustainability Hero.” Also, the Adopt-A Drain Program, Thin Film Plastics Recycling Program, and the Vegan Fest that she designed and led as grassroots initiatives each received statewide Environmental Achievement Awards from the Association of New Jersey Environmental Commissions (ANJEC). Additionally, she led the sustainability-focused non-profit that she founded to receive a New Jersey Clean Communities Council’s Volunteer Award.
