# Lanier Saperstein

## Adjunct Professor of Law

Lanier Saperstein has precedent-setting experience representing foreign financial institutions in the United States. He was, for example, the first lawyer in the United States to require a litigant to use the Hague Evidence Convention when seeking confidential bank records from China. Lanier has been recognized by leading publications for his work in international banking.

Representing financial institutions in both litigation and regulatory matters, Lanier has managed a broad range of issues relating to the Bank Secrecy Act, anti-money laundering, Office of Foreign Assets Control's (OFAC) sanction programs, the Anti-Terrorism Act, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, the bank examination privilege, suspicious activity reports, Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and international wire transfers, and alleged fraud claims under federal and New York law.

Lanier routinely handles subpoenas, asset restraints, as well as judgment and arbitral award enforcement actions that involve cross-border issues, and he has litigated key subjects relating to personal and subject matter jurisdiction, international comity, and the separate entity rule. He also is a member of the Firm's LIBOR transition team, advising financial institutions on the expected transition to alternative reference rates and implementing remediation plans.

Lanier is a member of the NYCBA Compliance Committee, co-chair of its Subcommittee on International Developments, and is an adjunct professor at Fordham Law School, where he teaches banking-related courses. He has written extensively on matters impacting financial institutions, and his writings have been cited in dozens of prominent law journals.
