Pompeo (seeking to invalidate the Department of State's public charge rule), and Lovely H. v. Eggleston (a class action alleging discrimination on the basis of disability against the New York City social services agency).

Susan is the Co-Chair of the Practicing Law Institute's annual program on Public Assistance and SNAP eligibility for advocates and pro bono counsel, and she serves as an advisory member of the Public Benefits Committee informing the work of the State's Child Poverty Reduction Advisory Council for Legal Aid.
