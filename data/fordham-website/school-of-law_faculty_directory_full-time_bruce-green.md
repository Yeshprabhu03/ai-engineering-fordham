Bruce A. Green is the Louis Stein Chair at Fordham Law School, where he directs the Louis Stein Center for Law and Ethics. He joined the Fordham faculty full time in 1987 after teaching as an adjunct associate professor. He currently teaches a course in professional responsibility and seminars in ethics in criminal advocacy and access to justice. He is a prolific and frequently-cited scholar.

Professor Green's work with the Stein Center has included helping to establish and organize a biannual Legal Ethics Schmooze, an annual Criminal Justice Ethics Schmooze, and an annual Access to Justice Roundtable. For more than 25 years, he has collaborated with the Fordham Law Review to produce an annual publication on the legal profession, and he has also often collaborated with the Fordham Urban Law Journal.

Through the Stein Center he has organized a host of other conferences, colloquia and symposia, book talks, CLE programs, and other events including the International Legal Ethics Conference (ILEC) held at Fordham Law in 2016.

Professor Green has engaged in many professional activities through bar associations and other professional organizations. Currently, Professor Green chairs both the ABA Standing Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility and the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination drafting committee. He is also a member and past chair of the NY State Bar Association’s Committee on Professional Ethics.

He previously chaired the ABA Criminal Justice Section, the ABA Criminal Justice Standards Committee, the NYC Bar Association’s Committee on Professional Ethics, and the AALS Section on Professional Responsibility. He also co-chaired the ethics committees of the ABA Litigation Section and Criminal Justice Section. He was the Reporter to both the ABA Task Force on Attorney-Client Privilege and the ABA Commission on Multijurisdictional Practice. He also served as an officer of the International Association of Legal Ethics.

While at Fordham, Professor Green has also engaged in various part-time public service, including as a member of the NYC Conflicts of Interest Board, as a member of the attorney disciplinary committee in Manhattan, as Associate Counsel in the office of the Iran/Contra prosecutor, and as a consultant and special investigator for the NYS Commission on Government Integrity. He has also contributed frequently to amicus briefs relating to legal ethics and criminal law and has become a frequently-quoted expert in the media on these subjects.

Before coming to Fordham, Professor Green was a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, where he served as Chief Appellate Attorney, and he was a judicial law clerk to Justice Thurgood Marshall and Circuit Judge James L. Oakes.


In 2018, Professor Green received the Michael Franck Professional Responsibility Award, given by the ABA Center for Professional Responsibility. -
