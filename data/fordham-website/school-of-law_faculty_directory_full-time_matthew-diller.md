Diller served as dean of Fordham Law from 2015-2024. Under his leadership, the Law School launched an array of new programs and centers focused on advancing legal scholarship and undertook a series of landmark initiatives focused on transforming the student experience, including the establishment of a 1L house system and the launch of new programs focused on diversity, equity and inclusion, wellness, and professionalism.

To bring greater attention to equal-justice issues, Diller launched the Access to Justice (A2J) Initiative at Fordham Law to promote teaching and scholarship in access-to-justice issues while also expanding legal services to vulnerable populations through Fordham Law’s clinics. He was also instrumental in building Fordham Law’s faculty and supporting legal scholarship.
