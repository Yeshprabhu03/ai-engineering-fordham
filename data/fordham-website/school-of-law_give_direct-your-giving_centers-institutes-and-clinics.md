# Centers, Institutes and Clinics

Fordham Law's [centers and institutes ](https://www.fordham.edu/school-of-law/centers-and-institutes/)are a tangible expression of the School's motto, *"in the service of others."*

They advance scholarship on critical legal issues. They provide hands-on training and continuing legal education. They deliver desperately needed legal services to the poor. They enrich the lives of students and alumni by exploring diverse perspectives on national and international legal issues.

Research projects and reports completed by our centers and institutes shape policy and legislation in a diverse array of fields, including human rights, intellectual property, securities, housing, privacy, and professional responsibility and ethics.
