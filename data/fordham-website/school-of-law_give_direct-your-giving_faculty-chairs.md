# Faculty Chairs

Our faculty is at the heart of Fordham Law School—indeed, of any great law school. The School's exceptionally qualified legal scholars are published in leading law reviews and maintain the best traditions of Fordham Law's scholar-teachers: They collaborate with one another and with students, sharing ideas freely and fostering open academic discourse that transforms students into the legal leaders of tomorrow.

At Fordham Law, donors have established endowed faculty chairs in key scholarship areas. These include advocacy; business law; evidence; information law; intellectual property; international law and human rights; legal ethics, morality, and religion; real estate, land use, and property law; and urban legal issues.

Additional faculty chairs will enhance the classroom environment for students in areas such as compliance, trial advocacy, and entrepreneurship.
