## Fordham Law School Fund

The Fordham Law School Fund pools gifts of varying amounts to provide unrestricted support for all of the resources needed to educate future Fordham Lawyers. With your annual fund gift, you become a partner in training the next generation of men and women who will uphold and shape the rule of law, protect civil and human rights, and advance our individual and shared liberties.

Your contributions give the School fiscal flexibility to enhance student and faculty recruitment, career planning services, scholarly research, student organizations, and hands-on training through clinical education.
