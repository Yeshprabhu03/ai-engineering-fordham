# Scholarships & Fellowships

Scholarships and fellowships are two of the most important ways to assist students and leave a legacy at Fordham Law School. They are also meaningful ways to honor family and friends.


Immediate Impact Scholarships

Current-use scholarships have an immediate impact on Fordham Law students. Every dollar donated goes directly to a student in need. Gifts to the scholarship fund from multiple donors have a collective impact, enabling the school to provide more financial aid to students. These gifts ensure that every deserving student, regardless of his or her financial situation, has the opportunity to attend Fordham Law.


Endowed Scholarships

Endowed scholarships are permanent and provide financial support to Fordham Law students in perpetuity. An endowed scholarship can be created with gifts totaling $100,000 or more. You can also designate a scholarship gift in your estate plans.

Endowed And Current Use Fellowships

Gifts to Fordham Law School’s fellowship funds provide financial support to students pursuing unpaid work over the summer or during the school year. These internships, traditionally with non-profit or governmental agencies, not only offer students with critical, hands-on work experience, they also help advance the public good by providing legal expertise to organizations that may be unable to afford it.
