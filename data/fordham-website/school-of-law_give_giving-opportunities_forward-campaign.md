## Campaign For The Fordham Law Experience

In launching FORWARD: The Campaign for the Fordham Law Experience, Dean Matthew Diller challenged all members of the Law School community to step up and support the next generation of Fordham lawyers.

Fordham Law School is deeply grateful to the 9,000+ alumni, friends, parents, faculty, and staff who answered Dean Diller’s call by [committing more than $110+ million](https://news.law.fordham.edu/blog/2023/06/21/fordham-law-school-reaches-exceeds-100-million-goal-in-forward-fundraising-campaign/) in support of the FORWARD Campaign. This record-setting figure has already enhanced the Fordham Law experience for current students and will continue to transform the legal education landscape for generations to come.
