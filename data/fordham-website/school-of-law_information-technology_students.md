## Printing

-
Printing at Fordham Law is facilitated by PaperCut. A solution that allows students and guests to securely and conveniently print via the web, email, and client software.

Printing is a two-step process that requires students to:

- Submit the document(s) they wish to print, then
- Release it to a printer of their choosing within the building

Students may release print jobs by logging in with their Fordham credentials or scanning their Fordham ID card (physical or electronic).

At the beginning of each academic year, every actively enrolled student receives a $200 print credit in mid-to-late August to support their educational printing needs. Once these funds are utilized, students must add funds to their account using the PaperCut Print Center. Charges are $0.10/per black and white page, $0.50/per page in color.

Printer Locations and Capabilities

Printers are conveniently located on floors 2 through 6, with the majority on floors 5 and 6 of the Maloney Law Library. Each printer supports:

- high-speed color printing, copying, scanning, and faxing
- duplexing (double-sided printing), stapling, and collating
