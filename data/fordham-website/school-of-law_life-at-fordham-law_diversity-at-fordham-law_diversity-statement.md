# Fordham Law Diversity Statement

## Diversity and Inclusion at Fordham Law

*American law is all about coming to terms with different perspectives. The genius of our system is that it enables many voices to be heard in the belief that through both collaboration and, at times, disagreement, we will come to solutions that move our society forward. At Fordham Law, our students examine and study this process closely so that they can become effective participants and leaders. It is essential that our classrooms and our community be comprised of students and teachers who reflect the diversity of our great city and country so that our students can learn to appreciate and come to terms with the viewpoints and experiences of those who differ vastly from themselves. The discussion and conversation in our classes, extracurricular activities, and in our hallways all work to form our students as professionals. A broadly diverse community will produce discussion and conversation that is richer and more complex and better serve our students as lawyers in training.*

Fordham Law School

For more than a century, Fordham Law School has been committed to creating learning opportunities for all students, but especially those who confront unique obstacles to entering the legal profession. It has historically played a critical role in ensuring access for immigrants, women, minorities, and others underrepresented in the field of law.

Today, Fordham continues this commitment and provides a complete legal education grounded in principles of equality and justice. Consistent with its motto, “In the service of others,” Fordham prioritizes more than just legal doctrine in preparing graduates for legal practice. It aims to equip students with the practical skills and problem-solving capacity necessary to practice law and meet the changing needs of 21st-century clients and an increasingly global and varied legal profession.

A broadly diverse learning community is essential to the excellent legal education that Fordham provides. We want our students both to understand the wide range of issues relevant to modern legal practice and to interact with and learn from others different from themselves. Fordham therefore looks to attract students, faculty, and staff from a wide range of backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences who are able to engage in the conversations, interactions, and activities at the heart of our educational program.

The extensive array of courses, clinics, externships, extracurricular programs, student groups, and activities available at the Law School help to ensure that all students receive the educational benefits of a diverse learning environment. They also help to foster the inclusion, mutual respect, and understanding that are necessary prerequisites in any academic environment, but especially one with Fordham’s focus on social justice and equality.

Together, the Law School’s curricular and non-curricular priorities work to advance its important educational mission. They also ensure the vibrancy and overall success of Fordham’s learning community.
