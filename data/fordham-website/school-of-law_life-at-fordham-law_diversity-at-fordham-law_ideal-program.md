- Joseph Landau, Dean of Fordham Law School## Our Mission

The IDEAL Program engages college students who are interested in pursuing a law degree. This comprehensive pre-law program is open to all students and welcomes a range of candidates who are actively seeking to enter the legal profession. The IDEAL program equips promising students with the tools, mentorship, and knowledge necessary to excel in law school and serve the local community.


Our Program

IDEAL exposes promising undergraduate students to a rich and dynamic experience in the law. Current college students may apply during their sophomore year for IDEAL I, and/or during their junior year of college for IDEAL II. Eligible candidates must be enrolled in a bachelor’s degree program at an accredited U.S. higher education institution.


IDEAL I

The IDEAL I cohort is convened during the summer between the sophomore and junior years of college. IDEAL I students are invited to Fordham Law School to complete the Practicing Law Institute course as an early introduction to the study and practice of law. Students enrolled in the IDEAL I cohort are exposed to various opportunities to learn about the law school experience and the legal profession through workshops, networking events, and community building activities. Students who successfully complete IDEAL I, may reapply for admission to the IDEAL II cohort the following year.


IDEAL II

The IDEAL II cohort commences during the summer between the junior and senior years of college. IDEAL II is mainly comprised of LSAT prep courses and step-by-step support for the law school admissions process. Through comprehensive programming, we aim to bridge opportunity gaps, cultivate a passion for justice, and empower students to become influential leaders and advocates within their communities and beyond.
