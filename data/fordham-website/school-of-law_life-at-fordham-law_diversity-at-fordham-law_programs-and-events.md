# Fordham Law Diversity Programs and Events

Fordham Dialogue Days

These ongoing programs challenge all members of the Fordham Law community to meet together in small groups and engage in open discussion of social justice issues.

Dean’s Student Advisory Council on Diversity

Students serving on this council will be tasked with identifying concerns and implementing change at the Law School. The council will meet regularly with Dean Matthew Diller to discuss diversity-related issues.

House Diversity Week

Through our house system, first-year students will spend a week engaging in small group facilitated discussions on important issues relating to systemic racism and other inclusion related issues. Diversity Week will be followed by a full day devoted to additional anti-bias training for the 1L class in the spring semester.

Faculty and Staff Diversity Trainings

Trainings of full-time and adjunct faculty address issues of anti-racism, unconscious bias awareness, and cultural competence in order to create a culture of inclusion in the classroom. In addition, staff trainings will include diversity and inclusion education to ensure greater sensitivity to the needs and perspectives of students of color. Additional opportunities are being developed for staff to participate in discussions surrounding anti-racism and issues relating to social justice.

Speaker Series

In conjunction with the Center on Race, Law and Justice and through partnerships with the Law School's many other centers and institutes, leading scholars and distinguished guests are regularly invited to the Law School to discuss interdisciplinary scholarship on race, gender, and diversity.

Development of Success Program for Underrepresented Students

We are committed to developing a pre-orientation program designed to serve incoming J.D. students from backgrounds historically underrepresented in the Law School and the legal profession. The program will focus on individuals from underrepresented racial, ethnic, geographic, socioeconomic, and first generation college backgrounds and will provide resources and advanced support to ensure that these students succeed in law school and develop a community with other entering students before beginning their classes. Through the program, participants will obtain the essential academic and professional skills needed to succeed in law school and the legal profession.
