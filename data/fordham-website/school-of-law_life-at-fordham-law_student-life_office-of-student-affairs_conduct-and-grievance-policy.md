# School of Law Student Conduct and Grievance Procedures

The Law School strives to provide a safe environment for all students, faculty, administrators, and staff. Consistent implementation and adherence to University and Law School policies help achieve this goal. It is everyone's responsibility to know these policies.

Every academic year, students will be required to submit a "Memorandum of Understanding" to Student Affairs affirming that they have read and understand the University and Law School's regulations, codes, policies and procedures. In addition, students must affirm that they understand that they must contact Student Affairs to amend, correct or update any information contained in their official admissions application, including, but not limited to, information regarding past or present criminal proceedings, disciplinary actions, or any other punitive proceedings.

## Smoking Policy

Fordham University regulates the smoking of tobacco products in compliance with the New York City Smoke Free Act of 1994, and amendments enacted December 30, 2002. Smoking is prohibited in all indoor public and working areas, including private offices, of the university.

Because the University will be subject to criminal and/or civil penalties for violation of applicable smoking laws, we must insist on strict adherence to this policy. Violators of this policy will be subject to disciplinary action. Any student who wishes to file a complaint may do so through the Assistant Dean of Student Affairs.
