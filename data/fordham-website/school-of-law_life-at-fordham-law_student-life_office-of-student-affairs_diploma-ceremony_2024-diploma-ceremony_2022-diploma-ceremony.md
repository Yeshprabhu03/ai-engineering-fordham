Diploma Ceremony - Select Award Videos

One of the highlights of the ceremony is announcing awards. Typically, we incorporate all of them into the event, but this year we are sharing four select awards online. All of the award recipients are people who have committed themselves to improving our community in transformative ways. Most student awards were announced during the ceremony.

Teacher of the Year award

The Student Bar Association presents the Teacher of the Year award to the professor students identify as being a master teacher.


Adjunct Teacher of the Year award

The Adjunct Teacher of the Year is selected by the Student Bar Association and given to the adjunct professor who demonstrates excellence inside and outside the classroom.

Dean's Medal of Recognition

The Dean's Medal of Recognition is the highest award the dean can confer upon a member of the Fordham Law community.

The Eugene J. Keefe Award is presented to the person who has made the most important contribution to the Fordham Law community. It is presented by the Student Bar Association in memory of a beloved faculty member who served at Fordham from 1926 to 1968.
