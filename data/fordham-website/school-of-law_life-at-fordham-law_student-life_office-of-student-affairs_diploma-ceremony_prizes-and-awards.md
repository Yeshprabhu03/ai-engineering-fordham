# Graduation Awards

Fordham Law School recognizes students and faculty for their achievements with a series of graduation awards.

Award Descriptions

THE ABRAHAM ABRAMOVSKY AWARD is presented to a member of the graduating J.D. class in recognition of their outstanding performance in Trial Advocacy.


THE JOSEPH R. CROWLEY AWARD is presented to the graduating J.D. student who has shown academic achievement and concern for others, as demonstrated by participation in volunteer activities. It is presented in memory of the associate dean and professor of law who served on the faculty from 1957 to 1985.


THE MARY DALY PRIZE in legal ethics is awarded to the graduating J.D. student who publishes the most significant writing relating to lawyers’ professional responsibility and/or the legal profession. It was established by the directors of the Stein Center for Law and Ethics in memory of their beloved colleague Mary Daly, who directed the Stein Center in the 1980s and ’90s.


THE EUGENE J. KEEFE AWARD is presented to the person or organization that has made the most important contribution to the Fordham community. It is presented by the Student Bar Association in memory of a beloved faculty member who served at Fordham from 1926 to 1968.
