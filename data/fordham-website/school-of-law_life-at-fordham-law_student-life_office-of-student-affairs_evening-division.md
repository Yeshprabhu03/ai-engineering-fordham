# School of Law Evening Division

Fordham Law School's Evening Division gives working professionals the opportunity to earn a law degree through a program that is flexible and accommodating to a busy professional and personal schedule. The excellence of the Evening Division is based on three distinct features: a remarkably diverse and academically gifted student body; a faculty composed of many accomplished full-time professors who are committed to both scholarship and teaching; and a program that works to integrate evening students into the full academic and social life of the school.

Evening students may participate in all of the School's activities and groups, including law journals, moot court, student government, clinics, and networking events depending on their personal schedules. There are also activities open exclusively to evening students. School administrators adapt their schedules to ensure that evening students have the support they need to excel in their academic and career development.

In the spring semester, the Office of Student Affairs and the Student Bar Association seeks nominations for Evening Students of the Year. These awards are given to third year and fourth year evening students who have demonstrated leadership qualities and success at work and at the Law School. The awards also seek to honor students who have made commitments to improving the Evening Division experience.

Nominations should include the name(s) of the student(s) and a statement of no more than 100 words describing why you believe he or she should be named one of our Evening Students of the Year. We are planning to name five Students of the Year at the last pizza night of the semester. Past recipients of the award are not eligible.
