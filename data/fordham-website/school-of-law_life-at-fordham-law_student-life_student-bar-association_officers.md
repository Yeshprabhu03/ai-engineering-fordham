# Officers

The Executive Board is elected by the student body every spring and consists of the President, Vice President, Vice President - Evening, Secretary and Treasurer. Senators are appointed to oversee committees such as admissions, community service, career planning and social events. Each fall, 1L section reps are elected by each first-year section. They meet with the Executive Board as advocates for the concerns of 1L students and organize educational, social, and community service events for their individual sections.
