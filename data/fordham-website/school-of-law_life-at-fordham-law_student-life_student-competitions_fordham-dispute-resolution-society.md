# Fordham Dispute Resolution Society

The Dispute Resolution Society is one of Fordham's highest ranked specialty program (15th in 2023 U.S. News and World Report rankings.) Founded in 2001, the Society accepts roughly 15% of all 1L and 2L students that try out for our teams, which compete in domestic and international arbitration, negotiation and mediation competitions. The Society’s teams have consistently placed among the top schools regionally, nationally, and globally.

## How to join the society

The Dispute Resolution Society accepts new student members each summer and fall based on performance in the Society's Summer Intramural Competition.

Fordham's Dispute Resolution Society is a student-run organization that competes in domestic and international inter-school competitions in various forms of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). These competitions allow students to develop practical skills during their tenure in law school. Skills in oral advocacy, brief writing, research, negotiation, mediation, and arbitration can all be developed through preparation, practice, and competition. The Society is among the top ADR programs across the country and was nominated as the ABA Chapter of the Year in 2003. Theory and practical skills training provide Society members with a foundation for practice in ADR, litigation, or transactional work that is rivaled only by Fordham's clinical program.

Students accepted into the Society become integral to Fordham's most successful student competition group. The Dispute Resolution Society has an unparalleled record in competition performance - winning innumerable awards during the Society's short history, including National Champions, Regional Champions, Best Oralists, and Best Memorandum honors.

The Society represents a group of closely knit students available to help prepare for competitions, and offer advice on job searching, interviewing, and any other questions that may arise during law school. Additionally, Society alumni graciously offer a wealth of information and opportunity to current Society members as they proceed from law school to the job market.
