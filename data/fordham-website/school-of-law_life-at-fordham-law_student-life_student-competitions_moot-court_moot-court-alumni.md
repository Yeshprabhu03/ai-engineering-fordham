# Moot Court Alumni

The Fordham Law School Moot Court Program owes a tremendous amount of gratitude to our extremely committed alumni who play an essential role in the continued strength and success of the program. We rely heavily on our alumni to help judge all of our intraschool competitions, including the Mulligan and Wormser competitions where we bring on new board members, the Mentor Competition where we host local high schools in a moot court competition or the celebrated Kaufman Competition where we welcome many of the finest law schools and judges in the country to participate in a competition at Fordham. The commitment by our alumni to preparing our interschool competition teams is also crucial to their long-running success in all of the competitions we enter.

The experience, passion and dedication which alumni bring to our program is unmatched and we sincerely thank you!
