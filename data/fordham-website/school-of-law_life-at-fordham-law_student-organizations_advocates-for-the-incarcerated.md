# Advocates for the Incarcerated

## AFTI

AFTI is an abolitionist organization advocating on behalf of those in prison and jail. AFTI understands that the prison industrial complex is a tool of violent white supremacy — AFTI therefore seeks to educate the Fordham community on these issues, participate in relevant advocacy efforts, and foster relationships with those currently and formerly incarcerated.

The Public Interest Resource Center (PIRC) student groups office is located at Room LL-101 of the Law School.
