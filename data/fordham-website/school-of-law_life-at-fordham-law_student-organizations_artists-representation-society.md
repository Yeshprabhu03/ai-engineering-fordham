# Artists Representation Society

## ARS

The Artist Representation Society (ARS) is dedicated to empowering and advocating for artists across all disciplines in New York City. We fulfill this mission by connecting creative individuals with crucial legal assistance, resources, and education. ARS unites Fordham Law students who are interested in working with the creative community that provides our city's vibrant culture.

Our programming offers a necessary platform for artists to engage with the legal aspects of their careers. Simultaneously, these events challenge our members to apply their legal education to facilitate positive change, address specific hurdles artists face, and identify ways to make a difference now.
