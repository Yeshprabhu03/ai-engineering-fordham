# Black Law Students Association

## BLSA

The purpose of BLSA is to assist minority students in succeeding in the Law School, to facilitate communication between Black law students at Fordham and other law schools, and to foster the Black community's understanding and access to the law.

BLSA hosts a number of events: a summer picnic for incoming students, a reception for minority students in early September, and an alumni dinner. BLSA also works with the Career Planning Office on the BLSA Job Fair and BLSA continues to participate in BLSA on a National and Regional level. BLSA also publishes an Alumni Newsletter.
