# Fashion Law Society

We are the student-run volunteer organization for the Fashion Law Institute at Fordham. As members of the Fashion Law Society you will have the opportunity to get involved with the Fashion Law Institute in a variety of ways, including volunteering at its pop-up clinics and the annual Fashion Law Symposium. In addition to the Fashion Law Institute events, the Fashion Law Society hosts its own luncheon speaker series, networking events, service days, bar nights, museum field trips, and more. Members also have access to the Fashion Law Society newsletter, which contains upcoming events on campus and around NYC, as well as up-to-date information on all that is fashion law related!
