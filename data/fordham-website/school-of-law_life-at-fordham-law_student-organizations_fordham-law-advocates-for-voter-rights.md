# Fordham Law Advocates for Voter Rights

## FLAVR

Fordham Law Advocates for Voter Rights (FLAVR) is a student-run nonpartisan voting rights organization created to advocate against voter suppression, educate the community on every individual's constitutional rights, and encourage people to vote. Within the school community, we bring awareness to current election law issues and frequently invite discussion on those topics.

The Public Interest Resource Center (PIRC) student groups office is located at Room LL-101 of the Law School.
