# Fordham Law Art Club

Art Club was created to provide a space for law students to express themselves artistically through visual arts. We are dedicated to fostering a community where students can explore their creativity and relax by painting, drawing, and appreciating art. All basic supplies are provided at our Studio Hour!

All students are encouraged to join (no artistic experience needed)!
