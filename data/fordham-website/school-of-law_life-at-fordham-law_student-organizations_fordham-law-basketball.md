# Fordham Law Basketball

The purpose of Fordham Law Basketball is to provide all members of the Fordham Law community with a fun outlet from the stresses of law school life. It also aims to foster meaningful connection between students of all class years and aid new students in getting acclimated to Fordham.

The group has four main objectives:

- to provide students with a group of others to associate with;
- to provide students with a weekly outlet by which to socialize with other peers;
- to foster connection among and between students of all years; and
- to assist law students in caring for their mental health by providing weekly exercise options.
