# Fordham Law Historical Society

## FLHS

Founded in 2017, the Fordham Law Historical Society is a student chapter of the Historical Society of the New York Courts, which includes many judges and practicing attorneys in New York. We are legal history enthusiasts looking to connect with like-minded students and practitioners. Joining this group is an excellent opportunity to network with attorneys and judges practicing at the State and Federal level in New York.
