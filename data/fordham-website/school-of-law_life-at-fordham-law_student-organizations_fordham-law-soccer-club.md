# Fordham Law Soccer Club

Founded in 2023, the Fordham Law Soccer Club (FLSC) organizes students to play in local soccer leagues - such as NYC Footy and Volo Sports - during the fall and spring semesters. FLSC also participates in an annual Inter-Law School tournament, competing against other NYC law schools, and attends various soccer events, including professional matches!

Fordham Law Soccer Club aims to provide all members of the Fordham Law community with fun opportunities to escape the stresses of law school. If you are looking to play soccer, watch a match, or meet interesting people, email us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#88eee4fbebc8eee7faece0e9e5a6edecfd)!
