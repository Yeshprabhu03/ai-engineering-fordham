# If/When/How Lawyering for Reproductive Justice

If/When/How: Lawyering for Reproductive Justice is a national organization that trains, networks, and mobilizes law students and lawyers who champion reproductive justice, defined as all people having the right and access to the resources they need to thrive and to decide if, when, and how to create and sustain their families with dignity, free from discrimination, coercion, or violence. Our chapter educates the Fordham Law community about reproductive health, rights, and justice issues; connects our members with other law students and practitioners who share an interest in this field; and provides volunteer opportunities for students to support local reproductive health care providers.
