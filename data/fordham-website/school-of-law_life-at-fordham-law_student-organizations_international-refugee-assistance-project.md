## IRAP

The International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) organizes law students and lawyers to develop and enforce a set of legal and human rights for refugees and displaced persons. Mobilizing direct legal aid, litigation, and systemic advocacy, IRAP serves the world’s most persecuted individuals and empowers the next generation of human rights leaders.

Since its founding in 2008, IRAP has provided legal aid to over 38,000 refugees and their families from over 100 different countries and has trained over 5,000 law students and lawyers in the process. Fordham University School of Law is one of IRAP’s 29 student chapters across the United States and Canada.

The Public Interest Resource Center (PIRC) student groups office is located at Room LL-101 of the Law School.
