# Mentoring Youth Through Legal Education

## MYLE

Mentoring Youth Through Legal Education (MYLE) is the Fordham Law branch of Legal Outreach, an organization that uses the law as a tool to foster skills and inspire vision among high school students from underserved areas around New York. MYLE coaches help high school students participate in three debate competitions per year on topics that range from Search & Seizure and Freedom of Speech to Equal Protection and Miranda Rights.

Students come to Fordham Law School for their debate prep sessions and debates take place at NYU, Brooklyn, and Columbia law schools. During prep sessions, MYLE coaches help their students understand the cases and fact patterns and draft their oral arguments. MYLE Coaches also attend the debates to support their students and to serve as judges.

No debate or con law experience is necessary! This is a great opportunity to make a meaningful difference in a student’s life, sharpen your own analytic skills and con law knowledge, and to network with attorney mentors.
