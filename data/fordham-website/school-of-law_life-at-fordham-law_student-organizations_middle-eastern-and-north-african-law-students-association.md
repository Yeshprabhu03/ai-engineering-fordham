# Middle Eastern and North African Law Students Association

## MENALSA

The Middle Eastern and North African Law Students Association (MENALSA) at Fordham is dedicated to fostering a greater awareness and understanding of the legal, cultural, and social issues impacting the Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) communities, both domestically and internationally.

MENALSA provides a welcoming and supportive space for law students of Middle Eastern and North African descent while promoting dialogue on the unique challenges and contributions of the MENA region to the global legal landscape. Through a diverse range of programs, including academic lectures, panel discussions, networking events, mentoring programs, alumni events, and cultural celebrations, MENALSA aims to engage students and faculty alike in meaningful conversations about the intersection of law, politics, human rights, and the rich cultural traditions of the MENA region.

We proudly support the cultural and professional growth of our members and allies while also enriching the understanding and appreciation of Middle Eastern and North African culture, politics, and legal systems for the broader Fordham Law community. MENALSA encourages participation from all students, regardless of background, in its mission to create an inclusive and intellectually stimulating environment where diverse perspectives are welcomed and celebrated.
