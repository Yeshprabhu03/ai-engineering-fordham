# OUTLaws

Fordham OUTLaws is Fordham Law’s LGBTQIA+ affinity and advocacy group. We welcome students of all backgrounds and thrive as a community enriched by diverse perspectives.

- Keep students informed about LGBTQIA+ job and internship opportunities in the legal field.
- Educate the law school community about LGBTQIA+ identities and experiences.
- Plan and host social, educational, political, and professional events to bring together the OUTLaws community; provide guidance to current students; encourage interaction with other LGBTQIA+ legal professionals; and promote inter-affinity group collaboration.
- Aid the recruitment and retention of LGBTQIA+ law students and professors.
- Facilitate connections between current OUTLaw members and OUTLaws alumni.
- Engage in political advocacy and community service in support of the LGBTQIA+ community.
- Expand OUTLaws’social media presence, such that prospective students can learn about the LGBTQIA+ community at Fordham Law School.
