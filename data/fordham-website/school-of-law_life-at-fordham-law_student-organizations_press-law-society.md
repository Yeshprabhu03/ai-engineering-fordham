# Press Law Society

The free and open press is the cornerstone of our democracy and the legal challenges faced by news organizations, journalists, and citizens exercising First Amendment rights should be scrutinized. The Fordham Press Law Society is a student-run organization based at Fordham University School of Law that seeks to unite students, journalists, and practitioners of First Amendment and media law to discuss the various challenges faced by the press and bring awareness to these issues. Our yearly programming offers students and professionals opportunities to connect. The Press Law Society’s events have included:

- Trips to the legal departments of media organizations, including The New York Times
- Panel discussions involving media law attorneys such as Davis Wright Tremaine’s Robert D. Balin and Debevoise & Plimpton’s James C. Goodale
