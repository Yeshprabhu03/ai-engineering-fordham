# Studying Law in New York City

## Studying Law in New York City

### New York City is at the center of the legal profession, and its energy as a global hub for business, arts, and entertainment is built into Fordham Law’s DNA. Wherever important things are happening—whether in the courtroom, the boardroom, or the halls of government—you’ll find our students and alumni contributing in ways that make the city and the world better.

## The Campus

Our state-of-the-art building, designed by the firm of Pei Cobb Freed, features nearly 350,000 square feet of program space, moot and trial courts, and a law library with 676 study spaces and a collection of 436,000 books and other documents. Soaring windows bathe the building in natural light, and the Robert Moses Plaza, located above ground off the second floor, offers an inviting green space to gather outdoors. Join us for a tour to see the campus firsthand.

“I've served on UN committees like the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and as UN special rapporteur on minority issues. These posts have given me the opportunity to travel to minority communities around the world to learn about the laws, policies, and realities regarding racial discrimination and talk to affected communities. Now, I think it's important to share these learnings with Fordham Law students and introduce them to the institutions of the UN, which are just across town on the other side of Manhattan.”-

Gay McDougal, Distinguished Scholar-in-Residence



“I interned with the Legal Department at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, just across the street from Fordham Law’s campus. This was an exciting opportunity because it feels like a big step towards one of my dreams—advocating for the arts through an agency like the National Endowment for the Arts. But between now and graduation day in two years, I can’t wait to continue blending my interests to fight for the issues I’m most passionate about and paving my own path forward in the legal world.”
