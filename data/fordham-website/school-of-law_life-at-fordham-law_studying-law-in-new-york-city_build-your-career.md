"My path to being a lawyer began with a strong legal education—and I can’t help but note the role of women in my education. I should have appreciated how amazing it was in 1981 that two of my four first-year professors were women. I wish I could do law school again… the gift of practicing law is that you’re doing something incredibly interesting all the time.”

—Kim Koopersmith ’84, Chairperson of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP

“My parents always placed a high value on education, and I always thought of law school as a way to empower myself and others. After speaking with my mentor, a Fordham Law alum, it became clear to me that Fordham provided the best opportunity for my professional growth. Since attending Fordham, I’ve been able to learn from some of the most amazing professors and peers. These lessons will stick with me throughout the entirety of my legal career.”
