# Three Convenient Locations for Adult Learners

We draw students from across the tri-state region, and because geographic convenience is a key element in an adult learner’s success, you can take courses at any of Fordham’s three campuses.

[Lincoln Center](/about/campuses/lincoln-center-campus/)The 8-acre Manhattan campus, at 60th Street and Columbus Avenue, spans two city blocks, with a landscaped plaza where you can find a respite from the City without actually leaving it.
