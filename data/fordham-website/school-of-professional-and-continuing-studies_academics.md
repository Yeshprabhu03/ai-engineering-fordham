## Bachelor's Degrees for Adult Learners

### Now is the time to reinvent yourself.

Take charge of your future with a bachelor's degree from Fordham University. With flexible evening, weekend, and online options and special support for adult learners, Fordham's School of Professional and Continuing Studies can help you earn a respected degree at your own pace.

**Not quite ready to apply?**We get it. It can be difficult to get all of the paperwork together to apply for a Fordham bachelor’s degree. But you can still start earning college credits this fall while you complete your application. You can

**enroll as a non-matriculated student and take one or two classes**, which you can ultimately apply to your degree. All we need is your ID and a copy of your high school diploma or GED, or a college transcript with any previous coursework. While you start earning credits, you can finish the rest of the components of your application for Fall and you may start the Fall with Fordham credits already under your belt!

## Pick Up Where You Left Off

Fordham's School of Professional and Continuing Studies was created specifically for adult students to complete their bachelor’s degree or begin their studies wherever they are in life. Our adult curriculum combines the strengths of Fordham’s core curriculum, which introduces you to the Jesuit intellectual tradition, with Fordham’s breadth of strong undergraduate majors, ranging from Philosophy and English to Business and Organizational Leadership.

And of course, our programs are offered in a format suited to your busy lives as parents, employees, and adults, with evening, weekend, and online classes.

We offer more than a dozen undergraduate majors, as well as post-baccalaureate and accelerated programs and non-credit courses at all three of Fordham's campuses — in Manhattan, the Bronx, and Westchester.
