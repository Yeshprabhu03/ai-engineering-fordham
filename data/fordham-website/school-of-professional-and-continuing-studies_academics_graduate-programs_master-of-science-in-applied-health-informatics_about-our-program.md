## Forty years later, "never" is right now.

Sitting at the junction of healthcare and information science, health informatics is a key enabler of some of the most amazing advances in medicine and patient care.

Today there are systems that can train a video camera on each patient and analyze the images to tell their temperature, pulse, and even their pallor—pretty much exactly what that Finnish doctor had said was impossible.

At the same time, machines have learned how to mine big data sets to make the seemingly impossible connections that lead to a deeper understanding of disease and drive the development of new drugs and therapies; artificial intelligence is able to interpret X-rays and CT scans, often better than the most expert radiologists; patients are wearing electronic monitors that keep track of chronic conditions such as diabetes or heart disease; and the next time you need an operation, you may find that your surgeon is a robot! All of this is made possible through the emerging field of health informatics.

Sitting at the junction of health care and information science, health informatics is a key enabler of some of the most amazing advances in medicine and patient care.

The field is essentially the application of information science and engineering to the practice of medicine, and it pulls from a wide variety of other disciplines, from computer science, software engineering, and data science to epidemiology, business, and decision science. And with today’s health care landscape providing such a long and growing list of problems to tackle—from rising costs to limited access to care—practitioners of health informatics are at the leading edge, designing, developing, and implementing scientific breakthroughs to meet those challenges.

Entry-level health informatics salaries are typically close to six figures, with 10-year veterans in the industry likely making almost twice as much.

The rapidly growing field also offers unique and almost limitless opportunities for students looking to develop and apply their technical skills. It could be recent graduates from any numerate discipline who are looking to shift careers; health care professionals who want to move across sub-specialties in medicine; or graduates who have been using computers and information technology in other jobs and now want to get into health care. And it could be any of the above looking to boost their income—entry-level health informatics salaries are typically close to six figures, with 10-year veterans in the industry likely making almost twice as much.
