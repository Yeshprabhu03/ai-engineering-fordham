Prospective students who have completed their applications by May 1 will be considered for a Dean’s Award. The Dean’s Award is a one time, merit-based scholarship for up to $6K towards tuition. Funding for these awards varies from year to year. There is no separate application to receive an award. The decision will be based on the merits of the student’s program application, and everyone is automatically considered for an award.

Other sources of funding for graduate education range from government agencies, employers and foundations to academic departments and schools. Please visit the

## International Applicants

-
Absolutely. Our current cohort is 85% international students.

-
Yes. Visit Fordham’s

[STEM Extension](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/academic-resources/international-services/students/post-graduation/stem-extension/)page for more information. -
Full-time Fordham master degree programs—like AHI—are eligible for student visas. This typically is a F-1 visa but, in some cases when eligibility is met, students are able to come to the US on a J-1 visa. All University sponsored visas are processed and administered by the

[Office of International Students](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/academic-resources/international-services/), this center is the best resource regarding visa questions.Unlike the United States, the United Kingdom allows for students to attend credit-bearing academic programs on tourist visas. Our Office of International Students can assist you with the I-20 application.

International students should note that while AHI is aimed at working professionals, a Fordham student visa only supports the ability to come to the US to engage with Fordham for academic purposes. This means students should not expect to complete wage/salary earning work in the US and Fordham under the student visa type.

-
Yes. All credentials in languages other than English must be accompanied by certified English translations. Transcripts from institutions not accredited in the United States or Canada must be evaluated course-by-course by

[World Education Services.](https://www.wes.org/) -
No, if international students would like to attend Commencement in person, they are able to do so on a tourist visa.


## Veteran Applicants

-
Yes. More information about education benefits offered by the VA is available at the

[Veterans Affairs website](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/). -
We are a proud participant of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' Yellow Ribbon Program. The Yellow Ribbon Program supplements veterans who are eligible for 100% of the Post-9/11 GI Bill.


## Program Format and Curriculum

-
AHI can be completed in 12 months. All courses are taught once a year. See the

[academics](https://www.fordham.edu/school-of-professional-and-continuing-studies/academics/graduate-programs/master-of-science-in-applied-health-informatics/academics/)page for more information on the coursework and course schedule. -
Yes and no. The first three courses, the core courses, are designed to be taken together so we require students to take all three during their first semester. After that, students can take electives at their own pace as long as they fulfill the requirements for matriculation (enrolled in at least one course, complete the program within four years).

The program uses a cohort model for its classes. It is highly recommended that students complete their coursework within the year in order to enjoy the benefits of learning alongside their other cohort members.

-
No. While asynchronous courses are popular, they do not lead to the best learning outcomes. While we do offer our courses online, we require our students to be present at the computer during the time in which the class is being offered in order to participate in the discussion and group projects.

-
Not at this time. We currently have only a fall entry for the program, as the requisite core courses are only taught in the fall. Electives cannot be taken until these courses are completed.

-
All determinations on course equivalence are at the discretion of the program director.

-
MBA programs are fantastic educational experiences that can be applied to a multitude of business sectors. Healthcare Management programs will speak two a multitude of management roles within a healthcare system, but do not provide a technological background in any given area. AHI is unique in its focus on healthcare, information science, and computer science. Our aim is to develop leaders who will be able to harness digital technologies to deliver high-quality, cost-effective health care. AHI graduates will become change agents in existing health organizations or start-up environments.


## Student Life

-
Yes. We cater the program to working professionals. It is very doable to work and complete the coursework. However, student visas typically do not allow international students to earn wages or a salary in the United States during their studies.

If the student does not return to the program within two years, Fordham requires them to reapply to the program.


## After AHI
