# Fordham Post-Baccalaureate Pre-Med/Pre-Health Frequently Asked Questions

**How long will it take me to complete the program given it’s an evening program?**

On average, it takes 2 -2.5 years to complete the foundation and upper level science courses. We say on average because students take courses at various paces, and need different courses depending on what their aspirant programs require

**Is financial assistance available for the Post-Bacc program?**

Fordham is one of the few programs where post bac students may apply for federal Stafford subsidized or unsubsidized loans of up to $12,500 for one year. Qualifications for this loan are based on individual student circumstances.

**Do I have to stay at one campus for my program?**

No. You may take classes at any campus during your program. The only exception are the biology and chemistry sequences. Sequence I and II of a science course must be taken at the same campus. For example, if you start with Biology I at Lincoln Center, you must take Biology II at Lincoln Center.

**If I took some courses previously, do I need to retake them in the post bac program?**

You may get a course waived IF you received a B- or better AND if you took the course no more than 3 years ago.

**I just need to take one of a few courses to complete my required coursework for my health program. Am I able to do that in this program?**

Yes. You would still need to apply to the Science track of the Post-Bacc program. You would not be eligible for advising or a Committee letter.

**How big are the classes?**

The class sizes are smaller and range from 15 to 30 students per class, depending on the class. The majority of evening class enrollment is other Post-Bacc students. There is also the opportunity for more personal contact with the science faculty.
