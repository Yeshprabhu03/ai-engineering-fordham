**SORAYA BEHZADI**

A few things about the Fordham PCS PostBac program are the in-depth and rigorous curriculum. It helped prepare me for topics on the MCAT and general knowledge. The smaller classroom sizes allow students to not only bond with their peers but also allow students to form genuine personal connections with professors for academic guidance. I am happy and grateful to have gotten the support I wanted from this program.

The Fordham PCS PostBac program provided a supportive and encouraging community that significantly impacted my journey. The faculty was genuinely invested in my success within and outside the program and offered me mentorship and guidance that helped me grow academically and personally. I left the program feeling prepared and inspired to pursue my physician dream.

**DANIEL ALAIEV (University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine)**

The Fordham PCS PostBac program is ideal for those looking to switch careers into medicine while working. The night classes and self-structured schedule allowed me to gradually transition from working full-time to studying full-time. The program structure was a key component in my good MCAT score, and the committee letter made a big difference in the admissions process.

**JARETT WALLERSON (Howard University College of Medicine)**

The Fordham PostBac process was seamless from the moment I applied, and the program allowed me the flexibility and opportunity to work full-time while preparing for medical school. Dr. Bigaouette coordinated everything and was always responsive. Thanks to the program, I am currently attending my top medical school choice, Howard University College of Medicine.

I appreciated the small classroom sizes and the professors who shaped my journey. I'm incredibly grateful to the professors who helped me hone my critical thinking skills: Dr. Cipriani, Dr. Kanan, and Dr. Olinares.

The CHP committee was a great benefit, and the process made me comfortable when it came time to apply to medical school. The committee allowed me to see what I needed to improve while remaining judgment-free. I appreciated the supportive environment at Fordham and even recommended the program to a friend who also got accepted into medical school this past cycle. I highly recommend it to anyone!

**HAYLEY ESTRELLA (Drexel University College of Medicine)**

What I liked about the Fordham PCS PostBac program was its flexibility. Since the program was self-paced, I could create a schedule that I felt comfortable with. I could perform to the best of my ability with a course load aligned with my full-time work schedule. I also appreciated Dr. Bigaouette’s constant support throughout the program and committee letter process.

**ALEXIS CARR (New York Medical College)**

I decided I wanted to be a doctor in September of 2017 and was enrolled in Fordham's premedical postbaccalaureate program by January 2018. Right from the start, I knew I was in good hands with Dr. Bigaouette—my positive, informed, and attentive advisor who supported me every step. I could not have asked for better professors whose teaching style set me up for success on the MCAT and medical school. Fordham's two campuses and flexible summer, weekend, and night classes helped me quickly earn the credits I needed while still allowing me to work full-time. With Dr. Bigaouette's continued guidance, I was ready to apply to med school before I knew it. I recommend Fordham to anyone considering a postbac and attribute so much of my academic success to their program.

**DALYNAH MALDONADO-MCGRATH (New York Medical College)**

I really enjoyed my time at Fordham PCS PostBac Program. It provided not just great education, but also excellent mentorship and guidance through the medical school application process. Dr. Bigaouette is very knowledgeable of what it takes to be a great candidate for medical school, and will make sure that your portfolio is ready when it comes time to apply. She is also very approachable and easy to get in touch with, a unique feature of Fordham PCS Post Bac. Overall as a career changer with no prior experience in science before this PostBac, I felt very prepared to apply to and start medical school and was accepted into one of my top choice medical schools.
