# Real Estate Institute Application

**The Admissions Process **

Fordham PCS utilizes a holistic or “whole file” admissions approach in reviewing applications for matriculation into its degree and advanced certificate programs. This approach helps ensure the consideration of a wide range of applicant qualities, and takes into account a broad base of evidence in rendering admissions decisions. **If you need help, please email us at [email protected] or call 212-636-7333.**

**Application Deadlines**

We accept students on a rolling basis, therefore applications are reviewed as they are submitted. While the start date of classes is the deadline for any given semester, the preferred deadline for fall admission is June 1 and for spring admission is November 1. International applicants are strongly encouraged to apply by April 1 for fall admission and October 15 for Spring admission.
