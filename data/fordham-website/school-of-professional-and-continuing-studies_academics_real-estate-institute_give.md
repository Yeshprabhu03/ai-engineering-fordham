# Give Today to Develop the Leaders and Workforce of Tomorrow

![](/media/home/schools/school-of-professional-and-continuing-studies/rei/REI-Give.jpg)

Every gift to the Fordham Real Estate Institute allows us to make a profound contribution to workforce development by offering financially challenged students access to professional development programs and meaningful careers in the real estate and construction industry.


Keeping Fordham REI at the forefront of real estate and construction education would not be possible without the tremendous support of our executive advisory council, alumni and friends. We thank you for all your support.

Thank you, Fordham REI, for helping me restart my career and realize my dream of living and working in NYC! After a dreadful near-death experience with COVID I was blessed with a second chance in life, so I decided to go for it and invest all my savings into furthering my career. I chose the Construction Management program at Fordham REI which awarded me a scholarship and helped me obtain an internship at a major NYC capital projects organization. Fordham’s talented faculty, modern campus, significant networking events, and graduate student organization has made my time here better than imagined. I am very grateful for having chosen Fordham, as it was the best option to restart this new chapter of my life.
