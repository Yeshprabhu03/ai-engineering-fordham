The built real estate world, and the diverse array of companies developing,

financing and servicing the industry, have a common denominator: The greatest

achievements and developments are all driven by titans — women and men

whose names are etched on skyscrapers, listed in mastheads, and noted in

textbooks.

Who are these titans of real estate, making headlines and headway in the

industry? What makes them tick, and what inspired them on their career paths?

And what lessons can real estate students and professionals glean to become the

titans of tomorrow?

Fordham University’s Real Estate Institute is offering a new series, Titan Talks,

hosted by Bess Freedman, CEO of Brown Harris Stevens, to share a behind-the-

scenes look at the leaders shaping the industry. Positioned at the epicenter of the

built world with a matching curriculum to produce the next generation of real

estate leaders, Fordham’s Real Estate Institute will bring the titans to you, and

help build your foundation for success!
