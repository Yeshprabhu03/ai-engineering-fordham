## Solving the Affordable Housing Crisis

**December 2, 2022****9-11 am Live event with virtual simulcast****Fordham University | 150 W. 62nd Street | Costantino Ballroom | New York, NY**

New York City is one of the most expensive places to live, and affordable apartments are dwindling. Between 2017 and 2021, the city lost roughly 96,000 apartments renting below $1,500 — as it gained 107,000 apartments renting at $2,300 or more. The vacancy rate for units under $1,500 was under 1 percent, while the rate for units renting above $2,300 was 12.64 percent.

Restrictive regulations, high construction costs, the loss of tax abatements, simple supply and demand – the reasons for the lack of affordable housing in the city are myriad. But what can be done?

Join Fordham’s panel of visionaries from multiple sectors like real estate development, finance, law, and government leaders to hear their views on how the affordable housing landscape has changed and what it will take to make city living affordable.

*Tokenization, Blockchain, and Crypto Currency is Coming to Real Estate*

*Find out what you need to know*

**July 8, 2021**

According to ResearchandMarkets.com, the global real estate market is expected to go from $2.7 trillion in 2020 to $3.7 trillion in 2025. Until recently, the best projects could only be accessed by accredited and institutional investors. But with tokenization, asset owners and developers can securitize their assets, making it easier and cheaper for investors to buy or sell real estate, and for owners and developers to raise capital...without a middle man.

How can you benefit from this convergence of real estate investing and blockchain technology? Find out at our summer "Picnic Lunch and Learn."
