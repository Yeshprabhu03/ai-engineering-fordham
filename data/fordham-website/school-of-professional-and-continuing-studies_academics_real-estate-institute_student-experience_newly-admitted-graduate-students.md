# Newly Admitted REI Graduate Students

**YOUR NEXT STEPS: **

**Intent to Enroll**

Please declare your intent to enroll (accept the offer of admission) via the Enrollment Response form and submit your $150 non-refundable deposit via check or money order payable to Fordham University. This fee will be applied to your first semester tuition bill as a credit.

**MSRE and MSRED Boot Camp: Real Estate Finance for Non-Finance Professionals (Optional)**

New MSRE and MSRED students who lack a background in finance, especially real estate finance, will be asked to take a short finance competency self-assessment quiz before they register for courses. Those who do not score 100 on the quiz are strongly encouraged to complete this 10-hour online pre-program boot camp which provides a primer on key finance, financial analysis, and financial modeling concepts and tools. Topics include time value of money, property income and expense statements, discounted cash flow analysis, and Excel financial modeling. Course schedule and registration details are available from an REI advisor.

**Official Transcripts**

If you submitted unofficial transcripts for an admissions decision, you are required to submit official college transcripts prior to your first semester of study. Official transcripts may be sent electronically to us from your prior academic institution or mailed to the following Fordham address:
