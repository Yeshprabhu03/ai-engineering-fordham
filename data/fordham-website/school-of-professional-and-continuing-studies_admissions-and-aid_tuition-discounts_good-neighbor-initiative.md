Students using the Good Neighbor award may qualify for additional aid such as merit aid, Pell grants, support from the New York State Tuition Assistance Program, and institutional aid. If a student qualifies for more than one discount (e.g., NYPD, FDNY, NYC Ballet Dancers, dependent of Fordham staff member, etc.), the student will receive the higher of the two awards. To qualify, students must do the following:

- Prove “neighbor” residency by completing the FAFSA.
- Apply and be registered as a PCS undergraduate student with Rose Hill or Westchester as your campus. (Students applying as a Rose Hill Student must live in the Rose Hill Good Neighbor zip codes; Students applying for the Westchester Good Neighbor program must live in the Westchester Good Neighbor zip codes.
- You must take at least 50% of your classes at your home campus every semester you are enrolled. If your class is not available at your home campus you may enroll in class in another PCS campus and still receive the benefit.
- Readmitted students will be considered case by case and must remain in good academic standing, with a minimum GPA of 2.0, to remain eligible for the Good Neighbor discount.
- Students must prove that they are living in a Good Neighbor Zip Code
**before**they complete their application. Students who move after they have been packaged will maintain their original packaging until the next academic year.
