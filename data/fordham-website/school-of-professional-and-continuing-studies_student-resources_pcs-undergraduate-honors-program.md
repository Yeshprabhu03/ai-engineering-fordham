![](/media/home/schools/school-of-professional-and-continuing-studies/Gothic-Classroom.jpg)

The honors program in the School of Professional and Continuing Studies fosters a diverse learning community of high-achieving students who desire to explore subject areas of specific interest and who seek opportunities to express their intellectual curiosity.

It is designed to give highly motivated students an opportunity to enhance and customize their undergraduate educations by collaborating with similarly motivated peers, working individually with faculty members, and engaging in advanced research, independent study, and/or artistic projects.

It is as much a community as it is a curriculum and the program presents an opportunity where outstanding individuals bond over a shared commitment to excellence while also having the flexibility to delve deeply into areas of research that support future graduate study or professional aspirations.
