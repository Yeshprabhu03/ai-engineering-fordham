From early in their educations right through high school, students succeed by demonstrating proficiency across a broad range of skills and subject areas. Work in college moves rapidly from that place toward a “major,” an areas of specialization in a particular field. The PCS Honors program gives students tools and opportunities to begin to move beyond the major - to see themselves as participants in a field, working to create new knowledge in the areas that most interest them. In most cases this means honors students are designing their independent study tutorials as first steps beyond college and into their futures in the wider world.
