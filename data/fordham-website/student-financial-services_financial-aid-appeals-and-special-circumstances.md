# Financial Aid Appeals and Special Circumstances

We understand that sometimes circumstances arise that weren’t reflected in your initial financial aid application. The Financial Aid Appeals process offers the opportunity to share those changes or challenges with us so we can align our resources with the real needs of families. We strive to ensure that financial barriers do not prevent talented students from becoming part of the Fordham family.

Please note, families may submit an appeal *only *after receiving their initial financial aid offer.

## Are you eligible for an appeal?

Wondering if your situation might qualify for a review? Take a look at our list of qualifying circumstances to help guide you.

-
**Examples of qualifying circumstances include*:**- Significant loss of income not reflected on your FAFSA or CSS Profile (reduction in household income greater than 15%)
- One-Time, non-recurring income (for example: a bonus, severance package, or inheritance)
- Medical expenses that were not reported on the CSS Profile or medical expenses from a single year that are more than 11% of your total income.
- Natural Disaster expenses not covered by insurance that occur within the last two (2) tax years.
- Supporting relatives outside your home.
- Divorce or Separation that occurred within the last two (2) tax years.
- Siblings in enrolled full-time in undergraduate post-secondary education and were not enrolled in the previous award year-(Continuing Students Only)

*You must provide documentation to support your special circumstance. Appeal requests without supporting documentation will not be considered.

*If your situation meets one of the qualifying circumstances above, please contact the Office of Student Financial Services at 718-817-3800. We’re happy to discuss your situation and guide you through the process. Requests via email will not be reviewed.* -

*We understand that every family’s story is unique, and sometimes financial challenges don’t fit neatly into specific categories. Even if you don’t have a qualifying circumstance, there are still a variety of ways to make Fordham more affordable. We encourage you to explore our*[payment plan](/student-financial-services/tuition-and-payments/paying-your-bill/#d.en.186486)and[financing options](/student-financial-services/undergraduate-financial-aid/)to help you manage costs in a way that works for your family.

-
If your situation meets one of our qualifying examples, the student and parent will receive an email with a link to submit an appeal checklist. We will also require you to complete the FAFSA (for domestic students) and CSS Profile (for all students). Depending on your situation, additional documentation may be required — these requests will appear in your financial aid portal.

-
Once all required documents have been received, most appeal decisions are made within 2-4 weeks.

-
Each request is reviewed thoroughly, considering all submitted information and unique circumstances, and all decisions are final. Additional appeal requests in the same academic year are not permitted. If there has been a change in your family's financial situation (e.g, recent job loss, loss of a family member, negatively impacted by a recent natural disaster) that was not previously reported, you may contact the Office of Student Financial Services to speak with a counselor.
