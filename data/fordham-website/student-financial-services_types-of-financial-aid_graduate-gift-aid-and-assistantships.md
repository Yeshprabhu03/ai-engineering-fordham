# Graduate Gift Aid and Assistantships

Fordham offers various types of gift aid, assistantships, and loans to graduate students.

The availability of aid and the application process vary depending on your graduate school. For information regarding institutional funds and assistantships, you must contact your graduate school directly.

*The Office of Student Financial Services only processes federal and private loans for the graduate population.*

Fordham commits to our veteran students by participating in multiple [Veterans’ Initiatives](/student-financial-services/types-of-financial-aid/veterans-initiative/) that offer them financial support.
