- Make your loan request 2–3 weeks before you need it to be in place.
- Approved loans typically disburse to student accounts 2–3 business days before the start of a term.
- The total amount you request is spread evenly across the number of terms in the loan period you request. For example, if you request a $6,000 loan for fall, spring and summer, $2,000 (gross) will be scheduled for each term.
- Federal Direct Loans cannot be used to cover prior balances for terms that have already finished classes. There are some
[private education loan options](https://www.fordham.edu/student-financial-services/types-of-financial-aid/graduate-loan-resources/#Private-Loans)that can be used to cover balances from prior terms. - The summer term is considered a “trailer” to the academic year. (i.e., The summer 2026 term is a part of the 2025–2026 academic year.)
- There is a 1.057% origination fee assessed by the Department of Education that is deducted from each loan disbursement. Make sure you consider this fee when calculating how much you need to borrow for each semester.

-
If you have inadvertently exceeded your undergraduate aggregate limit, here are some options for you to regain federal eligibility to borrow as a Graduate Student:

[Consolidate Your Loans](https://studentaid.gov/app/launchConsolidation.action)- Federal Direct Loan Consolidation loan is considered to be a satisfactory arrangement to repay the excess amount that restores the borrower’s eligibility for FSA aid. Once your consolidation loan is finalized,[submit the documentation](https://fordham.edu/faupload)to our financial aid office.- Repay the amount that is over the aggregate limit

If you have received Federal Direct Loans up to but not exceeding the aggregate limit for graduate students, you are still eligible to borrow a Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan.

-
Students who received a request from the financial aid office to provide documentation to clarify their federal loan default status have options to regain eligibility for federal aid. If you have already brought your defaulted loans back into good standing, please provide the financial aid office with documentation from your loan servicer. The Department of Education provides helpful resources regarding

[federal loan default status](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/default/get-out). -
