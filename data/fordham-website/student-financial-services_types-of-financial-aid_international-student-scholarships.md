Fordham University commits significant funds to support scholarships. Awards are made on a competitive basis taking into consideration academic and performance profiles, leadership, and other factors.

These four-year scholarships may be received for up to eight semesters (fall and spring only). The first five scholarships below are the most competitive. They are awarded to our top applicants upon admission.

*In keeping with our test-optional policy, applicants are not required to submit an SAT or ACT score to be considered for scholarships.*

The Presidential Scholarship is awarded to entering traditional first-year students who generally rank in the top 1 to 2 percent in their high school class.

The scholarship is awarded on the basis of excellent academic achievement in high school, test scores (if submitted), and personal characteristics.

The awards also cover the average cost of a double room or actual charges, whichever is less (excluding meal plans and fees), if the student lives on campus.
