# Financial Aid Guidance for International Students

At Fordham, we know that applying for financial aid as an international student comes with its own unique set of questions—and we’re here to help you find the answers.

Who is eligible for international student need-based financial aid?

New first-year applicants for the fall semester with a non-immigrant visa may apply for need-based financial aid. A [non-immigrant visa](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/all-visa-categories.html) is issued to individuals who enter the U.S. temporarily for a specific purpose — such as studying or working — without intending to stay permanently.

To qualify, the CSS Profile Institutional Methodology (IM) formula must demonstrate sufficient family contribution funding of **at least $35,000** towards the annual [cost of attendance](https://www.fordham.edu/student-financial-services/tuition-and-payments/#tuition).

-
As available funding for international students is limited, need-based awards do not cover the complete annual cost of attendance. The annual awards may range from a few thousand dollars up to the cost of a student’s first-year full tuition charges.

-
Fordham offers need-based institutional grants. Loans and work-study positions are not offered as part of a financial aid package. View more information about

[employment opportunities with an F-1 student visa](/academics/academic-resources/international-services/students/current-students/working-legally-in-the-us/).

-
All complete applications for admission are automatically considered for

[merit scholarships](/student-financial-services/types-of-financial-aid/international-student-scholarships/). No supplementary materials are required to apply. Merit award notifications are included within the online admission letter. -
Current and continuing students should review their

[financial aid portal](https://fass.fordham.edu/NetPartnerStudent/Logon.aspx)to ensure they are meeting all requirements for award renewal. All students must maintain satisfactory academic progress, a minimum 2.0 cumulative GPA (or higher, if specified in the terms of the award), and compliance with other University policies and the University Code of Conduct.

- Select “Yes” when asked if you are applying for financial aid on the Fordham University member questions of the Common Application.
- Submit the CSS Profile (school code: 2259) and any supporting documents by the deadlines for your chosen admission plan.

### CSS Profile

Fordham University requires each biological parent to complete a CSS Profile. As you complete your profile, you can instruct the College Board to provide your noncustodial parent with instructions on how to complete a separate CSS Profile. A noncustodial parent is typically the parent who contributed less than half of the financial support to the student during the past year.

*Fall term first-year international need-based financial aid applications without a CSS Profile on file by the above deadlines will be reviewed by admissions without consideration for financial aid.*

**TIP: You can instruct the College Board to provide your noncustodial parent with instructions on how to complete a separate CSS Profile.**

-
**Early Decision I**- Early decision is a binding application plan. Early decision applicants make a commitment to a first-choice institution where, if admitted, they will definitely enroll. This means students must enroll if admitted and withdraw any other pending applications.
- Admitted applicants who complete the financial aid process by November 20, will receive notification of their financial aid offer by December 20.
- The early decision deposit deadline is January 15.

**Early Decision II**- Early decision is a binding application plan. Early decision applicants make a commitment to a first-choice institution where, if admitted, they will definitely enroll. This means students must enroll if admitted and withdraw any other pending applications.
- Admitted applicants who complete the financial aid process by January 3, will receive notification of their financial aid offer by February 15.
- The early decision II deposit deadline is March 15.

Early Decision I Early Action Early Decision II Regular Decision December 20 December 20 February 15 April 1 -
Once you submit your admission deposit, log onto your Financial Aid Portal to view and accept your awards online.

-
Initial awards will not be adjusted for future years of study. All awards are offered at the same amount annually for up to four years provided the student meets minimum GPA and Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements. Students and families must budget their finances accordingly, expecting estimated annual cost of attendance increases of 3-5%.

-
Fordham is need-sensitive in the international application review. Due to limited available funding, the amount of demonstrated need may impact the final admission decision.

-
Approximately 7% of international students who applied for financial aid are selected for awards.

-
As Fordham does not commit to meeting full demonstrated need and requires a substantial minimum family contribution of $35,000 to qualify for aid, CSS Profile fee waivers are not offered.

-
Eligible non-citizens and U.S./dual U.S. citizens living abroad who wish to be considered for financial aid will complete the

[domestic student aid application process](/student-financial-services/undergraduate-financial-aid/). -
Transfer students are not eligible to apply for need-based aid. Please review more information about available

[merit scholarships](/student-financial-services/types-of-financial-aid/international-student-scholarships/). -
Any international need-based aid (Faber Award) recipient who receives U.S. citizenship or a green card during enrollment at Fordham will maintain a Fordham Tuition Award of equal value to their initial award for up to four years total.

The FAFSA must then be completed for aid renewal for all citizens and eligible non-citizens.
