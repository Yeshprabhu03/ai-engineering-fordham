[Eligibility ]

Financial aid is available to U.S. citizens and [eligible non-citizens](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens). State, federal and institutional aid is determined by estimated family contribution, enrollment status, academic performance and availability of funds. See our [Net Price Calculator](/student-financial-services/tuition-and-payments/undergraduate-tuition/net-price-calculator/) for a preliminary estimate of federal, state, and institutional aid eligibility.


**TIP: **Make sure Fordham has your correct social security number on file and that you file both the FAFSA and CSS Profile using the name and number printed on your social security card.

[How to Apply]

The process to apply for financial aid is essentially the same for all prospective students. Complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and CSS Profile to receive maximum consideration for all types of aid including Fordham grants and scholarships. To be considered exclusively for federal aid, only the FAFSA is required.

### CSS Profile

[File the online CSS Profile](https://cssprofile.collegeboard.org/) via the College Board. Make sure to include Fordham as a recipient using the code **2259**. Input the 2024 tax data. Estimates of 2025 and 2026 income information may also be required. If your parents are married or live together, they will file one CSS Profile. If they are separated or divorced, each parent will fill out their own CSS Profile.

**TIP: You can instruct the College Board to provide your noncustodial parent with instructions on how to complete a separate CSS Profile.**

### FAFSA

**Submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) online using code 002722 for Fordham. **

**TIP: You may be able to use the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) to transfer 2024 federal tax information into your 2026–2027 FAFSA, if eligible.**
