# Commuter Student Services

Commuter Student Services offers a variety of services for both traditional live-at-home commuters and off-campus commuters.

Every commuter is assigned a Commuter Assistant that serves as a resource for anything related to Fordham.

The Commuting Students Association provides programming that is open to the entire Fordham community but is held at commuter-friendly times. A variety of on-campus programs exist to enhance the commuter experience at the University.
