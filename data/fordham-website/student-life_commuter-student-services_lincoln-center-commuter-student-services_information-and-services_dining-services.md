![Cafeteria Atrium](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/Cafeteria_Atrium_2__2__1.jpg)

Fordham Dining is a great resource for all commuting students to the Lincoln Center campus. Undergraduate commuters can be found hanging out in the Ram Café in Lowenstein, visiting the Smeltzer Dining Hall in the Law School, or enjoying an "all you care to eat" lunch or dinner in the Community Dining Room. At teatime, pick up a drink at the Argo Tea in 140W and chat with your friends in the adjacent Garden Level Lounge.
