# CLC Policies for Rose Hill Commuters

## The Commuter Life Committee (CLC)

A committee under the Commuting Students Association, with the purpose of creating policies to address commuter issues and/or concerns on campus. Inspiration for our proposals is obtained through our [Commuter Concern Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdC3CUTMOK1iqB1aSbzNNhBUwbxUGfRMK0Rj5TVqshU2m9H4Q/viewform?usp=header), personal experiences, and communication with fellow commuter students.

Involves:

- Engaging with Constituents
- Proposal Writing
- Surveying, Canvassing, Petitioning
- Direct Advocacy with University Administration

**Past Successful Proposals**

**McShane Art Exhibition - Your Borough, Your Story**

An opportunity to showcase powerful artwork from students at Fordham University, highlighting the diverse perspectives that make our city so vibrant.

**Rainy Day Rentals**

An initiative stemming from personal experiences of NYC’s sudden rainy surprises. With Rainy Day Rentals, you can borrow an umbrella with a small deposit, stay dry, and return it within 5 days to get your deposit back. It’s quick, convenient, and the perfect solution for those unexpected downpours.

**Nap Pod**

An essential skill for a commuter student is the ability to take a nap anywhere and everywhere, even in the most uncomfortable positions. In collaboration with USG, Campus Affairs, and OSI, this initiative acknowledges the need for rest in a comfortable environment for commuters to recharge. Reserve the nap pod on Google Appointments and fill out the required [waiver](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfX5Zzk-zQUqKw9WsLdwu_EUMPt0c7d33Y53LLACXrIqYUmKw/viewform).
