# Rose Hill Commuter Support for Upperclassmen

We, at Commuter Student Services, recognize the need for continued support of our community beyond the first year. As students transition from freshman to sophomore, from on-campus to off-campus, and in some instances, transfer to our Fordham community, we seek to extend our services to these individuals. In recognition of our larger community, in the Fall of 2020, we implemented an opt-in program for the upperclassmen students.

**What is the benefit of having a commuter assistant as an upperclassman?**

Commuter Assistants will provide the following:

- Weekly email updates with upcoming events
- Provide 1-on-1 opportunities to connect (virtually and in-person)
- Serve as a commuter mentor as needed
- Opportunity to participate in our monthly meal voucher program

**How do I sign up?**

If you are an upperclassmen commuter or off-campus student interested in being paired to a Commuter Assistant, please fill out this [Commuter Assitant form](https://forms.gle/eryAboH7JsiUyGoJA).
