#### First Year Commuter Welcome Barbecue

During the summer, new commuter students are invited to attend a FREE outdoor summer barbecue, where they have the opportunity to meet other new students, meet campus administrators and tour the campus. This is a commuter student’s first chance to meet with their Commuter Assistant (CA) group, and start to build relationships with those upper-classmen. At the barbecue, students learn more about student activities, New Student Orientation and commuter life at Fordham.

#### Digital Meal Voucher Lottery and Lounge Luncheons

Commuter Student Services (CSS) sponsors a meal program for commuter and off-campus students. Each month, a google form is sent out to the community to sign up for the digital lottery and 50 students win a meal voucher that can be used at an on-campus dining location. Additionally, twice a semester you can stop by the student lounge in the lower level of McGinley to mingle with other students over a free meal. More details can be found on the Commuter Student Services OrgSync portal!

#### Monthly Community Socials

One Thursday every month the Commuter Assistant hosts Community Socials during the activity block. These meetings typically involve a fun activity or competition, as well as important announcements from various departments on campus who are here to support all students.

#### Commuter Career Chats

In collaboration with the Office of Career Services and Gabelli's Personal and Professional Development Office, the Commuter Assistant teamwork to invite employers to host information sessions throughout the semester at commuter-friendly times. Past employers that have participated in this program are Deloitte, EY, PwC, Teach for America, Nike, etc.

#### Thanks-Give-Away (Fall Semester)
