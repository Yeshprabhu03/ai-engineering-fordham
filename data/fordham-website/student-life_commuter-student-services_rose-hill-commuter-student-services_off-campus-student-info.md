In many ways, living off campus means you will assume more responsibilities such as:

- Paying monthly bills
- Cooking and cleaning
- Living in a neighborhood with college students and non-students

Living off campus also has financial implications. Costs that are included in room and board charges for living on campus such as food, Internet, television/cable and utility bills are new expenses that you will have to consider and manage in addition to a monthly rent.

The question for you to answer is, “Are you ready to live off campus and on your own?"
