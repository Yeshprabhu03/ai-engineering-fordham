# Deans of Students and Student Life

Each undergraduate campus has a Dean of Students. The Dean works with, educates, and supports students and oversees an area of the University known as Student Life, a part of the Division of Student Affairs concerned mainly with student experience outside the classroom and overseen by the Associate Vice President.

Student Life is generally comprised of the
[Office of Residential Life](/student-life/living-on-campus/), the
[Office for Student Involvement](/student-life/student-involvement/) and the
[Substance Abuse Prevention/Alcohol and Other Drug Education Programs](/student-life/safety-health-and-wellness/substance-abuse-prevention/) at each campus. Programs and services in this area include student conduct, housing, orientation, student club and organization advising, leadership development and counseling intervention. Each area works closely with colleagues in the
[Student Services](/student-life/student-services/) area of Student Affairs.
