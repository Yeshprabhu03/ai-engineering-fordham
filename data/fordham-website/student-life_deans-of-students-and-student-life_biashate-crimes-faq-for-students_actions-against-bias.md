# Actions Against Bias

**Action Against Bias**Updated 9/25/2025

Our community is not isolated from the larger context of the ongoing national struggle against bias in its many forms. While we cannot always keep these repugnant events from occurring in our midst, we are committed to excellent education, training, and response to incidents of bias, bias crimes and hate crimes on campus. The University has worked over many years to continuously add to its array of resources, protocols and policies and to assure that response is sensitive, caring, and transparent. Our response will be ever-changing and improving, tailored to the incident, the changing culture and developments in student affairs practice, but strives to uphold the mission and values of our University, which call each of us to welcome and respect one another.

-
**University Policies and Procedures****Bias-Related Incidents and/or Hate Crimes Policy:**The University’s policy regarding bias-related incidents and/or hate crimes is included in the Student Handbook and disseminated to the entire community at the beginning of each semester. For students, the policy is enforced through the student conduct process, and all student bias-related incidents and/or hate crimes policy violations are handled by the Dean of Students and the Department of Public Safety.[http://www.fordham.edu/info/21684/university_regulations/6566/bias-related_incidents_andor_hate_crimes](https://www.fordham.edu/info/21684/university_regulations/6566/bias-related_incidents_andor_hate_crimes)**Bias/Hate Crimes Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):**A document answering frequently asked questions related to bias/hate crimes and how to report these incidents is available on the Student Affairs website and disseminated to the entire community at the beginning of each semester.[fordham.edu/bias](https://www.fordham.edu/bias)**Bias Incident Resource Group (BIRG):**The Bias Incident Resource Group is composed of administrators within the division of student affairs at Fordham University. Consistent with Fordham’s mission and commitment to diversity, the purpose of the group is to promote an environment of care, inclusion, respect and moral reflection. Following a bias related incident, BIRG engages and empowers all members of the community through mutual education, support, and shared dialogue.[http://www.fordham.edu/info/24936/biashate_crimes_faq/7896/bias_incident_resource_group](https://www.fordham.edu/info/24936/biashate_crimes_faq/7896/bias_incident_resource_group)**Confidential Online Reporting System:**A confidential online reporting system was created on the[fordham.edu](http://fordham.edu/)portal for Fordham community members to report non-emergency incidents.[https://www.fordham.edu/student-life/deans-of-students-and-student-life/caring-for-students/non-emergency-department-of-public-safety-on-line-reporting/](https://www.fordham.edu/student-life/deans-of-students-and-student-life/caring-for-students/non-emergency-department-of-public-safety-on-line-reporting/)**Internal Bias Response Protocol:**Student Affairs’ bias response protocol was developed to integrate and coordinate the work of the multiple Student Affairs departments and programs that respond to bias/hate crime incidents. This protocol includes the convening of the University’s Emergency Management Team to assure that clear and accurate information is shared and coordinated among all areas of the University. -
**Professional Staff Hiring:**The Division of Student Affairs is committed to a hiring process that seeks to recruit and hire a talented and diverse pool of candidates for positions at all levels of the Division and in all departments.**New Staff Orientation Program:**The New Staff Orientation is a one day program welcoming new staff in the Division of Student Affairs. The program consists of sessions focused on history: the life of St. Ignatius, history of Jesuit education, and history of Fordham University. There are also sessions about the structure of the division, our mission statement, and expectations. In addition, the program includes bias crime reporting and response training for all new staff and we also conduct annual refresher bias response training for all staff in September. New Staff Orientation occurs two per year depending on the number of new staff hired during the course of the year.**Divisional Staff Training:**Student Affairs requires all full-time and part-time staff to participate in a Divisional Training Day each semester. The topics for the training days vary, but are focused on issues related to our students and how staff in the Division of Student Affairs can best serve students. Diversity and inclusion has been the main topic for numerous mandatory Divisional Staff Training Days. Some of those topics have included:- Let’s Talk About It: Educating for Racial Justice (all staff completed implicit association tests)
- Jesuit Mission and Commitment to Anti-Racism
- Universal Design: Intersections of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion with Disability and Accessibility
- The Complexity of Gender in Higher Education: Building a Mission Centered Approach to Understanding Ourselves and Supporting Students

**Civility and Community Core Programming Session (required for all new undergraduate students):**In August 2014, a required core program was developed for all new freshmen centered on the concept of civility grounded in the Jesuit principles of*cura personalis*and*men and women for others*. The program is designed to include elements of Ignatian pedagogy of context, experience, reflection, action and evaluation. The 2020-2021 iterations of the program expanded on concepts connected to Anti-Racism, implicit bias, and systemic racism. The program includes interactive activities and a video conveying a unified campus message about civility, community, expectations and resources.**Diversity Assessment in Student Affairs Department Assessment Presentations:**All departments in Student Affairs are required to include assessment metrics related to diversity programs and initiatives in the annual Department Assessment Presentations that take place each June. Divisional Planning Days with all Deans and Directors in Student Affairs have included components of the day dedicated to sharing and discussing department Anti-Racist action plans/initiatives. -
**Training and Workshops:**The department facilitates diversity training and workshops with a number of student leaders and a growing number of administrators at both Rose Hill and Lincoln Center every academic year averaging anywhere between 600 - 800+ students. Many of the training sessions occur in August before the academic year starts, however, many other requests come in during the year. Students learn about the department as a resource, participate in interactive activities, engage in DEI topics/conversations, and ultimately explore how these concepts apply to their specific student leader roles. Some student groups include: Resident Assistants, Orientation Leaders, Commuter Assistants/Freshman Mentors, Ram Van Drivers, and Rose Hill/Lincoln Center Ambassadors (tour guides).**Racial Solidarity Network: (**five-hour workshop) This program provides the Fordham community (students, faculty and staff) an opportunity to increase empathy, awareness, and understanding around the complexities related to race and the unique lived experiences people share as racial and ethnic beings. A pilot of the program ran during Spring 2017. The program officially launched in Fall of 2017.**LGBTQ and Ally Network of Support: (**five-hour workshop) This program promotes an understanding, acceptance, and appreciation of our lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) students that is rooted in the Jesuit tenet of Cura Personalis and the principle that all persons should be treated with dignity and respect, which is explicit in Catholic teaching. The program is open to the entire Fordham community (students, faculty and staff). One training session takes place on each campus during both the fall and spring semesters.**Diverse Student Engagement - Cultural Club Advising:**OMA serves as the formal club advisor to seven (7) cultural clubs at Lincoln Center and eight (8) at Rose Hill.
