# Caring for Students

## Cura Personalis

One of the tenets of a Jesuit education is *cura personalis* - “care of the whole person.” It means that we don’t just tend to your educational growth; we strive to foster your moral, emotional and spiritual growth, too. It also means we take our responsibility for your well-being and safety very seriously.
