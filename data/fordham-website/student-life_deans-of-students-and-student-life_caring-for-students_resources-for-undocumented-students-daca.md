# Resources for Undocumented Students (DACA)

As a Catholic and Jesuit University, Fordham values the dignity of all members of the University community. For over 175 years, we have kept faith with the vision of Archbishop John Hughes who founded Fordham to serve immigrants and their sons, daughters, grandsons, and granddaughters. The resources listed below are to aid our undocumented students.
