# A Serious Problem

Research at Fordham and across the country has demonstrated a link between substance abuse and academic failure among college students.

11 percent of students at Rose Hill and 13.5 percent of students at Lincoln Center acknowledged having missed a class due to alcohol or other drug use (Core Survey 2023).

16.6 percent of students at Rose Hill and 9.8 percent of students at Lincoln Center admitted to have performed poorly on a test or important project due to alcohol or other drug use (Core Survey 2023).

Faculty and administrators are of tremendous assistance not only in referring students for help in this area, but in creating a campus culture where substance abuse is less frequent.
