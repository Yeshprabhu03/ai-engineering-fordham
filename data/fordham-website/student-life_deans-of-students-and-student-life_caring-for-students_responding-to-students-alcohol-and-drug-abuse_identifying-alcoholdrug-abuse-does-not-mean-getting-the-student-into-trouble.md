# Identifying Alcohol/Drug Abuse Does Not Mean Getting the Student into Trouble

Fordham wants most of all for students to feel comfortable calling for help in an emergency. To assist with this, the [Medical Amnesty Policy](/student-life/deans-of-students-and-student-life/student-handbook/university-regulations/a---z-listing/medical-amnesty-policy/) has been in place for many years. This policy assures students or friends who call for help that they will not be “in trouble” for consuming alcohol or other drugs the first time something like this happens. Students who call for assistance are immediately aided by Fordham EMS and Public Safety. Once they return to campus, instead of referral to the student discipline process, they simply meet with the dean of students or Residential Life staff member to discuss the incident and receive a referral to the [Alcohol and Other Drug Education Program](/student-life/safety-health-and-wellness/substance-abuse-prevention/alcohol-and-other-drug-education-at-lincoln-center/) (Lincoln Center campus) or [Substance Abuse Prevention and Student Support](/student-life/safety-health-and-wellness/substance-abuse-prevention/prevention-and-support-at-rose-hill/) (Rose Hill campus). Repeat problems are addressed with progressively more intensive assistance.
