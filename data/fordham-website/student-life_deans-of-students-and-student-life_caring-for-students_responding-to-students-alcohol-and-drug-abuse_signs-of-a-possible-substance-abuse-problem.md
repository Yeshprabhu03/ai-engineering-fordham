# Signs of a Possible Substance-Abuse Problem

These are some common warning signs that a student may have or be at risk for developing an alcohol or other drug problem:

- Changes in their appearance
- Loss of motivation or energy
- Changes in personality; shifts in moods or emotions
- Frequently arrives late or cuts classes
- Comes to class exhausted, with a hangover or impaired
- Experiences frequent health problems (illness, injury)
- Frequently requests extensions, turns in work late or not at all
- Dramatic decline in academic performance
- Makes excuses for poor performance or missing classes
- Brags about their substance use or conversations are frequently about alcohol or drug use
- Admits to frequently passing out or suffers blackouts while drinking
- Frequent problems with law enforcement or University authorities

Please note that many of these behavioral descriptions refer to general emotional distress, too. Students often “self-medicate” unpleasant emotions by using substances including alcohol; and chronic substance abuse can lead to emotional difficulties.
