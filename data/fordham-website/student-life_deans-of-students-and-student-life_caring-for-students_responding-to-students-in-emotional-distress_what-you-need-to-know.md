# What you need to know

College is a time of growth and change; students encounter many firsts as they shed familiar supports and assume greater responsibilities. While most students can manage the demands of college life effectively, for some the challenges prove overwhelming and can impair their social, emotional and academic functioning. While faculty members are often willing to assist a student in emotional distress, they often question whether the situation warrants intervention and the manner in which to approach the student. This guide is designed to help faculty recognize these students and respond effectively. Faculty members are also encouraged to consult the professional staff listed within this guide.
