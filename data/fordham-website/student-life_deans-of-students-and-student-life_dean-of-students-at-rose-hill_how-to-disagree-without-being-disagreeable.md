### Advice, Resources, Discussion, Questions, and Answers on Viewpoint Expression in a Caring Community

A joint project of Campus Activities Board, United Student Government, select Fordham Faculty, Rose Hill Student Life, and the newly-launched Civics and Civility Initiative, this event offers advice and encourages discussion by asking the question: in a community like Fordham's- one in which civility is an expectation of all members- how can we best approach viewpoint expression and engage in meaningful dialogue? How can we express views in ways that balance the rights and dignity of all community members with what the University makes clear in its [ policies](https://www.fordham.edu/student-life/deans-of-students-and-student-life/student-handbook/university-regulations/a---z-listing/demonstration-policy/) and mission is the right of its members “to freely express their positions and to work for their acceptance whether they assent to or dissent from existing situations in the University or society”?

Given deep differences in viewpoint over everything from the ongoing conflict in the Middle East to the impending general election, the University- you may be surprised to learn- is committed to helping individuals and groups in expressing their viewpoint, In fact, it has never in more than three decades refused any request to organize a protest or demonstration. Come learn more.

Please join our panel of speakers and participants in what we hope is civil and engaging discussion on a challenging topic:
