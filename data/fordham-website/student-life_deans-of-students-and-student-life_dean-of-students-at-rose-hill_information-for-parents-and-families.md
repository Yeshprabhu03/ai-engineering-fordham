## May 23 Reminder Email for Summer Orientation Program Registration

Dear New Students and Families,

On behalf of the Orientation team congratulations on your acceptance to Fordham. You are now #FordhamBound!

Welcome to our community and to our family of thinkers, leaders, and learners at Fordham, the Jesuit University of New York. To assist with your transition to college we will be sharing additional resources throughout the summer to make the transition an easy and seamless experience.

We are pleased to invite all incoming undergraduate Rose Hill students and families to attend one of our three Summer Orientation Programs (SOPs) this year. SOPs are offered as an optional introduction to college life at our Rose Hill campus. They provide useful information for parents and families to help prepare you for your first year, and they’re a great opportunity to meet classmates, returning students, faculty, and staff.**SUMMER ORIENTATION PROGRAMS**

Features of the Summer Orientation Program

All three Summer Orientation Programs offer the same sessions and information, though the first SOP (June 30th) has some additional content for transfer students.

All programs will feature an introduction to the Fordham University history and mission, our Jesuit heritage and traditions, academic overview presentations from Fordham College at Rose Hill and Gabelli School of Business staff, breakout sessions for new students, as well as specific sessions for parents, campus tours, and Q&A panel sessions with current students and administrators.

Summer Orientation Program Dates

- Monday, June 30 (additional content for transfer students)

Dear Student,

Fordham University has a proud 182 year history of approaching learning in the Jesuit Catholic tradition. Learning occurs inside and outside the classroom: our students are challenged to be women and men for others, to unite heart and mind and to develop– through inquiry, community, and practice– lifelong habits of authenticity, conscience, character, and intellect.

For Fordham, life on campus is a part of your education, and first-year Rose Hill students choose from a variety of residence halls and experiences, each with its own character and style. All of the communities we create for and with our students share a commitment to participation and engagement - academics balanced with personal growth, intentionally designed and led by dedicated professional and undergraduate staff to support our institution’s mission.**WHERE SHOULD I LIVE ON CAMPUS?: ROSE HILL HOUSING OPTIONS**

**Residence Halls and Integrated Learning Communities**First-year students who choose to live on campus can expect to enjoy a very special experience. Our Rose Hill campus offers a wide variety of residence halls, each with its own unique architecture, ambience, focus, and style.

[— contains detailed information about all available housing locations, programs, and options. Please become familiar with the contents of this brochure as it will help guide your choices.](https://www.fordham.edu/info/23312/discover_your_home)

**Discover Your Home****Traditional Residential Halls**The Rose Hill campus has four traditional residence halls open to first-year students. These offer a more conventional and general experience versus the greater focus of other programs:

- Alumni Court South

- Faber Hall

- Loschert Hall

- Martyrs' Court LaLande & Goupil

- Tierney Hall

**Integrated Learning Communities**In addition to our traditional halls, first-year students may choose to apply to one of the three Integrated Learning Communities (ILCs). These on-campus residence halls are intentionally designed to integrate Fordham’s renowned intellectual tradition with the traditional experience-based learning of life in a campus residential community. Each community has its own specific concentration, goals, architecture, amenities, and style; each opens its doors to members of the incoming class who are committed to a particular focus. Take a look
