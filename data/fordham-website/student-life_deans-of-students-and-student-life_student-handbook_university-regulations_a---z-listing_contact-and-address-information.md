# Student Handbook: Contact and Address Information

Students are required to provide emergency contact information as well as permanent and local addresses to the University to allow contact, mailings, communication, and information for use in emergencies. Students changing either permanent or local mailing addresses must update this information with the Registrar via the university's system of record.


All students whose local address is not the same as their permanent address and who do not reside in University owned or leased housing are required to update the Registrar via the university's system of record at the beginning of each semester.
