# Student Handbook: Drugs

Fordham University strictly prohibits the unauthorized possession, use, distribution, sale, facilitation in the sale, purchase, or production of barbiturates, amphetamines, marijuana (including medical marijuana and cannabis oils), opiates, hallucinogens, or any other addictive or illegal drugs and/or drug paraphernalia. Such conduct violates the University Code of Conduct, as well as applicable law.


For the purposes of this policy, “drug” includes, but is not limited to, marijuana (including medical marijuana and cannabis oils), heroin, LSD, cocaine, mushrooms, ecstasy, ketamine, and illegally-acquired or misused prescription drugs. Drug also includes any substance that is used to change mood or alter reality and is not used in accordance with a medical prescription (e.g., household chemicals/agents, steroids, naturally derived substances). “Drug paraphernalia” includes, but is not limited to, hookahs, pipes, bongs, hollowed out cigars, grinders, scales, and vaporizers.

All illegal drugs and drug paraphernalia are subject to confiscation and the University reserves the right to refer potential criminal violations to local law enforcement authorities. Students who have used or are using drugs may wish to seek counseling and are reminded that physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, substance abuse counselors, and pastoral counselors are available for such help.
