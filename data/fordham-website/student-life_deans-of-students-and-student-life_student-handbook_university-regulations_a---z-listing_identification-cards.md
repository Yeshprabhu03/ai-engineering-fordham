# Student Handbook: Identification Cards

Every registered student at Fordham University is required to carry the University Identification Card at all times while on campus and to surrender it upon the request of clearly identified University personnel (this includes public safety personnel) in the performance of their duties. ID cards are only to be used by the student to whom the card is issued. Students are not allowed to give their ID cards to another student or guest for their own purposes.

Identification cards are permanent and are issued during the fall and spring opening and move-in periods to new students. In the event a card is lost or a student withdraws from the University, he/she must report the loss, theft, or withdrawal immediately via the Fordham website. To request a replacement during business hours, please go to one of the offices/areas [ HERE](Student%20Use%20of%20Fordham%20Name,%20Logo,%20Seal,%20and%20Marks):

After hours, students must contact the Department of Public Safety at his or her campus to obtain a replacement ID Card. The University will immediately deactivate any ID reported lost or stolen. Students must have a Fordham ID Number (FIDN) to obtain a new card.
