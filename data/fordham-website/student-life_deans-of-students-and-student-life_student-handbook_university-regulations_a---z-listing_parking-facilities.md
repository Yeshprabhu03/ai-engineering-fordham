# Student Handbook: Parking Facilities

In an effort to accommodate its students and personnel, Fordham University operates its own parking facilities and has established traffic procedures. The facilities are maintained by the Department of Public Safety which establishes and enforces traffic procedures. As a member of the Fordham University community, you are earnestly requested to familiarize yourself with its regulations and to honor them. The Motor Vehicle Regulations Booklet is found online on the Parking Permit Application. Failure to abide by these regulations is a violation of the University Code of Conduct (Article 13). Students use the University parking facilities at their own risk. Activities such as running, jogging, skateboarding, and loitering in the University parking facilities are prohibited.

All vehicles will park in the University garage at Rose Hill. Vehicles parked elsewhere on campus will, without further notice, be immobilized or towed from campus at the owner's expense.
