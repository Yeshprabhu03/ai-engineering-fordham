# Student Handbook: Railroad Crossing

The University is very concerned that neither students nor any of their guests attempt to cross the Metro North railroad tracks adjacent to the Martyrs' Court/Alumni Court/Campbell and Salice-Conley Halls area of campus. Trespassing on railroad property is not only illegal but, more importantly, also extremely dangerous to the life of the trespasser. Commuter trains travel at very high rates of speed at that point and round a bend before they can be seen or heard. Any Fordham University student who fails to abide by the law and this University policy shall be subject to the student conduct process.
