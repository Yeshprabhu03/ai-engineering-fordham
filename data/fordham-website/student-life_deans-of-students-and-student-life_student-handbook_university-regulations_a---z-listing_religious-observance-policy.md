# Student Handbook: Religious Observance Policy

Students who are absent from school because of their sincerely held religious beliefs will be given an equivalent opportunity to register for classes or make up any examination, study, or work requirements they may have missed because of such absences on any particular day or days. No fees of any kind will be charged by the University for making available to these students such equivalent opportunities.

Students who intend to avail themselves of any aspect of this Religious Observance Provision should kindly advise and notify their instructors at least two weeks in advance of the beginning of the respective registration or examination period for that particular semester, or at least two weeks prior to any affected class session.
