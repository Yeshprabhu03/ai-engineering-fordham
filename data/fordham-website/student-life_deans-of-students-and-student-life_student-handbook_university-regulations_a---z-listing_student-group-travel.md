# Student Handbook: Student Group Travel

Any group of students interested in traveling off campus as representatives of the University must first receive approval for the trip from the sponsoring office or program and inform the Dean of Students or his/her designate. Once approved, the group leader must provide the following information for each student traveling to the Dean of Students and the Department of Public Safety (recognized Student Organizations submit the information to the Office for Student Involvement):

- Name of student traveling
- Local contact information
- Emergency contact information
- Dates and Times of the trip
- Travel destination
- Means of transportation
- Contact person/phone number at destination
- Chaperone Name and Contact Information
- Activity Waiver

It may be necessary, as determined by the Dean of Students or their designate, for the group to be accompanied by staff members of the Division of Student Affairs, faculty members, or other administrators approved by the Office for Student Involvement for student clubs and organizations and/or the Dean of Students or their designate for other student groups.

All students traveling are expected to abide by the Fordham University policies as published in the Student Handbook. All travel arrangements for recognized student clubs and organizations must be arranged through the Office for Student Involvement. Other departments, programs, and offices make travel arrangements for students participating in programs that these areas organize and coordinate with the Dean of Students and the Department of Public Safety to ensure that preparations for emergencies during travel are thorough. Enterprise car rental requests must be made at least five business days in advance of travel, and bus rental requests must be made at least three weeks in advance of travel. Students traveling as part of a Student Organization are expected to abide by the travel policies for the Office for Student Involvement for each campus.
