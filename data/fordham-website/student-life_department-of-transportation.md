Whether traveling between campuses for class, going home via the airport before a holiday, or just looking to experience the scene in another borough, the Ram Van is the safest and most convenient way to get there.

Student organizations, including clubs and athletic teams, can also charter Ram Vans for travel to approved events.

A one-way ticket costs $3.50, but students with classes at two campuses, unpaid and for-credit internships, or participating in certain clubs may be eligible to [ride the van for free](/student-life/department-of-transportation/ram-van-shuttle/free-passes-policy/).
