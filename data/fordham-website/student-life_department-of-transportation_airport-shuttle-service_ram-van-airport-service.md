# Ram Van: Airport Service

Before all University holidays, including the end of the academic year, the Department of University Transportation provides shuttle service to LaGuardia, JFK, and Newark International airports.

**Groups**

Limited availability, groups may request to charter a van to any airport. These accommodations can seat up to 10 people with one bag or seven with two bags. The cost is $160. Please email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#aedccfc3d8cfc0eec8c1dccac6cfc380cbcadb) to inquire.

**Refunds**

There are no refunds for cancellations made less than 72 hours in advance. Missing your scheduled departure time will result in forfeiture of the fare.

**Deadlines**

The deadlines to reserve a guaranteed spot on a van are listed below. Once we have received these reservations, we custom make a schedule based on the need. While we accept post-deadline sign-ups only for outgoing service, space is limited. Please note that we cannot accept post-deadline sign-ups for inbound service. Additional vans will not be added. We strongly encourage you to sign up before the deadline.

**Luggage Restrictions**

Van seating will be rearranged to accommodate bags. However, passengers are limited to the number of bags they are allowed to bring. For the Winter and End of School Breaks, passengers are allowed two bags and one carry-on item. Passengers are allowed one bag and carry-on item for the Thanksgiving and Spring/Easter Breaks.
