# Ram Van Outbound Airport Service: Luggage Restrictions

Airport shuttle vans will remove the rear row of seating to accommodate luggage. However, space is still limited, and we ask that passengers comply with the following luggage rules:

- For Winter Break and End of Year Service, passengers are allowed two bags and one carry-on item.
- Passengers are allowed one bag and one carry-on item for all other breaks.

If you have more things to bring home, consider shipping them through the postal system, which is often less expensive than extra-baggage fees airlines charge.
