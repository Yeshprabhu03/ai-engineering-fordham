# Ram Van: Charter Trips, Golf Cart Shuttle Services, and Event Management

The Department of University Transportation is proud to offer customized services to the university community members. We provide chartered trips, golf-cart shuttles, and event management services, and we're here to help any organization at Fordham achieve its goals by assisting with anything transportation-related.

**Charter Trips
**

We perform over 2,500 chartered trips every year, providing essential transportation to and from locations throughout the Northeast. If you're interested in chartering a Ram Van for your organization, please [submit a request](/student-life/department-of-transportation/charter-trip-program/requesting-a-charter-trip/), and an administrator from our office will be in touch with you shortly. Please note requests need to be made **two weeks in advance** of the date of the trip.

**Golf Cart Shuttles**

If you're hosting an event on campus and need one of our golf carts to help things go smoothly, we've got you covered! Available in all seasons, our fully-accessible golf carts help guests get around our 85-acre campus quickly and conveniently. We routinely provide golf carts for:

- Alumni reunions
- University Commencement
- Athletic events
- Jesuit Ordination

If you're interested in arranging golf cart shuttles, please [submit a request](/student-life/department-of-transportation/charter-trip-program/requesting-a-charter-trip/), and an administrator from our office will be in touch with you shortly. **Please note that we cannot provide charter services for weddings taking place at the University church.**

**Event Management Services**

Fordham is no stranger to large events, and the Department of University Transportation is more than capable of facilitating the movement of large groups of people. Our team of administrators and student leaders is adept at planning and executing large-scale operations involving hundreds of guests and dozens of vehicles. Some examples from the recent past:

- International Conference on Cyber Security, hosted by Fordham and the Federal Bureau of Investigation
- Fordham Jubilee
- New York City health summits
- University Commencement
- Conference of Jesuit Advancement Administrators
