## Taking the Stress Out of NYC Travel

Ram Van has experience with events of all sizes, including:

- Academic Conferences
- Private Sector Conferences
- 3,000+ visitor shuttle service
- Multi-day events
- Multi-venue events

These events often require highly specialized planning. Please get in touch with us as soon as possible at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#196b78746f7877597f766b7d717874377c7d6c) or by phone at (718) 817-4346. Ram Van is ready and willing to help but asks that you contact us well in advance. Events planned during the non-academic year, such as Summer or Winter break, must be coordinated at least one month before the event.** Note that all events must be affiliated with the Fordham community**. Payment for all travel arrangements must be arranged via Fordham University budget transfer.

**Please note that we cannot offer charter trip services for weddings taking place at the University church.**
