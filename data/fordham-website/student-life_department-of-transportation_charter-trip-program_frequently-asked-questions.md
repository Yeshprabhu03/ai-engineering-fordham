A: As of January 5, 2025, vehicles entering the Congestion Relief Zone (CRZ) in Manhattan—local streets and avenues at or below 60th Street—are being charged a congestion toll. The toll is $9 per vehicle per day during peak hours (5:00 a.m. - 9:00 p.m.) or $2.25 during overnight hours (9:00 p.m. - 5:00 a.m.). On weekends, the peak hours are from 9:00 a.m. - 9:00 p.m. If a vehicle is transiting through Manhattan on the West Side Highway or the FDR Drive to another borough and does not take local streets and avenues in the CRZ, they will not be charged the additional toll. Fordham University is not exempt from paying the congestion toll.

**All charter trips that enter the CRZ will have the toll added to their quote per vehicle per day. This includes charter trips with Lincoln Center as their pick-up or drop-off point****and charter trips****solely transporting passengers between Rose Hill and Lincoln Center.**
