# Requesting a Charter Trip

## Looking To Request a Trip? Here's How.

##### 1. Talk to your budget supervisor/club advisor first.

A Fordham budget administrator must approve all requests. Requests for club travel should be submitted with an Office of Student Involvement (OSI) representative listed as the budget administrator.

##### 2. Figure out what type of service works for you.

Ram Van offers various services, which are explained in greater detail [here](/student-life/department-of-transportation/charter-trip-program/services-and-vehicles/). Think about what type of service works for your group and your budget. Contact [[email protected] ](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cfbdaea2b9aea1aca7aebdbbaabdbc8fa9a0bdaba7aea2e1aaabba)with any questions *before *submitting your request.

##### 3. Submit the charter trip request form!

Please carefully submit our [charter trip request form](https://podio.com/webforms/17573288/1181226). You’ll need the following information handy.

- The number of passengers you plan on transporting (be specific!)
- The exact street address of your destination (including town and postal code)
- The name and email of your budget supervisor
- A contact point for the day of travel

If you have a request that doesn’t seem to fit the form’s questions, give us a call at (718) 817-4346 or email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#95e7f4f8e3f4fbf6fdf4e7e1f0e7e6d5f3fae7f1fdf4f8bbf0f1e0) before submission. We’d be happy to help!
