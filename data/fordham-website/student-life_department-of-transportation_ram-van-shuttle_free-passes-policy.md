# Ram Van Free Passes Policy

The Department of University Transportation proudly offers free passes to students meeting specific qualifications.

Free passes are **automatically issued weekly on Wednesday mornings** (approximately 9 AM), beginning on the Wednesday before the start of the term, for all students whose class schedule meets the eligibility requirements below. The free passes are added to students' accounts on our reservation system and will be used for the *following week's* classes. If a student automatically receives free passes for class, no further action is needed on the student's part.

- If you register after the semester has already commenced, or during the Add/Drop period, you will not receive passes until the Wednesday after registering. Refunds are not issued for tickets purchased during the Add/Drop period while waiting for the next disbursement of free passes if your eligibility status changes.
- The Ram Van office is not responsible for lost or stolen passes.
- Employees of Fordham University are not eligible to receive free passes. This includes work-related travel for a teaching assistant and/or graduate assistant position.
- Free passes are for the student who received them only. Any recipient of passes caught selling their passes will be reported to the Dean of Student Life and Public Safety.
- Free passes expire at the end of the semester you receive them.
- Club sports and varsity athletics are not eligible for free passes for athletic-related travel.
- If free passes are used for any travel outside of the purpose you received the passes, you will run out and will not be entitled to additional free passes.
- Our free passes policy only extends to the Ram Van. We do not provide free passes for any other form of transportation, including but not limited to Metro-North, LIRR, NJ Transit, subway, buses, taxis, or rideshares.
