# Office of Disability Services: Applying to Fordham

**The admissions process is handled solely by **[Fordham University Admissions](/admissions-and-aid/)**. Any questions regarding admission to the University, regardless of a disability, need to be directed to the admissions department of the school to which the student is applying.**

The University will make admission decisions using criteria which do not consider an individual's disability. Fordham University Admissions follows regulations that:

- Will not impose or apply admission or eligibility criteria that screen out or tend to screen out individuals on the basis of a disability, unless such criteria is necessary for the provision of the program, service or activity being offered.
- Believes that this carries out the intent of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.
- Does not consider a student's disability in evaluating admission criteria.
- Will not discriminate against the student on the basis of the disability and will make reasonable accommodations when necessary.

Students with disabilities desiring to enroll in any program, service or activity of Fordham University must be able to meet the minimal standards of both the University and the particular school, program, service, or activity to which admission is sought.

**It is within your discretion to inform the Admissions Committee of a disability.**

You may request reasonable accommodations in the application process, and must make that request to the Director of Admissions. Please keep in mind that it is your responsibility to identify and substantiate the disability and the need for accommodation, and to explain how the accommodation requested relates to the disability.
