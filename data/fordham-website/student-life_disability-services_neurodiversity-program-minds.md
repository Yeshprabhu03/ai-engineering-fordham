# Neurodiversity Program (MINDS)

## Mentoring and Inspiring NeuroDivergent Students (MINDS) at Fordham

The purpose of this supplemental pilot **Fordham MINDS** program through the Office of Disability Services (ODS) at Fordham University is to provide additional support to our growing population of neurodivergent students. In this program, our students’ social, advocacy, and academic organizational skills will be developed and encouraged. This program is currently only available at the Rose Hill Campus.

**The MINDS program will include:**

One weekly group meeting to discuss students’ issues and accomplishments that have occurred

since the last meeting. Possible solutions to any issues and ways to advocate will be explored.

Two weekly one-on-one academic coaching sessions to enhance academic organizational skills:

time management, materials organization, calendar planning, advocacy, determining priorities,

and assignment breakdown. It will be the same coach each session.

One weekly meal during the first month of each semester at campus dining hall.

Two on campus sporting events in the fall: one home football game and one home basketball

game.

One on campus theater performance during the spring semester.
