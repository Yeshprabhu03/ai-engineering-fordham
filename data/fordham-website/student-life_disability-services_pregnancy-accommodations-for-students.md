# Pregnancy Accommodations for Students

Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex including pregnancy and parental status in educational programs and activities. At Fordham University students may find more information at the following link on the Title IX Office website.

[View Title IX Pregnancy and Parenting Resources](/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/title-ix-office/non-discrimination-policy/pregnancy-and-parenting-resources/)

Additionally, although pregnancy is not considered a disability, accommodations may be implemented due to pregnancy-related complications through The Office of Disability Services (ODS)*. Learn more about the [ODS registration process](/student-life/disability-services/new-ods-students/).

***Please note that virtual accommodations are not available through ODS for disabilities of any sort.**
