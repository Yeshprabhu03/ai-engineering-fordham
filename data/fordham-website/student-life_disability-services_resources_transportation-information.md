# Transportation Information

Fordham University provides intercampus transportation via Ram Van. Additionally, Rose Hill has a shuttle that travels throughout the main campus with stops in front of most main buildings. For more information, visit [intercampus transportation](/student-life/department-of-transportation/).

The Office of Disability Services is not responsible for the Ram Van or campus shuttle. Additionally, ODS does not assign accommodations for either.
