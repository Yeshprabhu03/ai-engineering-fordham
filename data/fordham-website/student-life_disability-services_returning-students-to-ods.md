# Information for Students Returning to ODS

During the first 2 weeks of the semester, please log into Accessible Information Management (AIM) and put in your accommodation requests.

The directions can be found on the [AIM Instructions page.](/student-life/disability-services/aim-instructions/)

[View the Office of Disability Services AIM Instruction Guide](https://fordham.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=b8691ddc-02f8-47a9-98c7-ad89016221ce)

ODS will approve and send emails to your professors usually within 24 hours. Once your accommodations been sent out, please download your letters. From here you can either print them out and hand them to your professors, or attach them to an email. Please make sure your professors have received, and understand your accommodations.

If you have testing accommodations, your professors must fill out the testing contract in order for you to sign up to take the exams. If you do not see your class listed when you go to sign up for the exam, this means the Professor has not yet filled out the contract and you must remind them to do so. Please email your professor and cc ODS so we can assist in getting the contract completed.

***Please note that virtual accommodations are not available through ODS for disabilities of any sort.**
