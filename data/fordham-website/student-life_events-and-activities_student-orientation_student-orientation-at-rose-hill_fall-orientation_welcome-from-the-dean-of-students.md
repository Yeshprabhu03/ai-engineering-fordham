# Welcome from the Dean of Students

Dear Fordham Student,

Welcome to Fordham University. Congratulations on being accepted to the Jesuit University of New York. We are especially delighted that you have accepted our invitation to join this extraordinary community.

Though we just celebrated commencement here in the Bronx, preparations for your arrival are well underway. All of us in student life are planning your Fordham experience outside the classroom– a common project for and with student leaders and partners across the University. This mission-driven complement to the academic core is in many ways the sixth class in which you will be enrolled here at Rose Hill– the classroom of experience. Generations of students who have preceded you cherish this intentional and inclusive community mainly because they have– with a bit of help and guidance from us– built it themselves. The student leaders you will meet in the coming weeks and months– orientation leaders, commuter assistants, and resident assistants among many others– will help you find your place here in our community and introduce you to its high expectations for participation, service, civility, and respect for the dignity of others. What it is to be a Ram, in other words: a person for and with others.

Our orientation staff and all of us in Student Life look forward to sharing this challenging, innovative, and distinctively Jesuit approach to education with you at our upcoming orientation events and to seeing you become an active part of it. Your experience will kick off shortly: every member of the class is expected to attend. We look forward to seeing you soon.

As you navigate to graduation and through the summer, **it is particularly important that you continuously check your newly-issued Fordham email to avoid missing next steps, deadlines, announcements, and opportunities over the summer. **Questions? Please also reach out at any time to these offices in student life, the area the dean of students oversees:

Residential Life creates an on campus community of rights, respect, and responsibility with your active participation and through the dedicated work of resident staff. Ask them questions on housing, move-in, and our residence halls:

Student Involvement is the home of the orientation program, advising and support for our more than 160 clubs and organizations, commuter student services, leadership development, the McShane Campus Center, and more:

I remind you that you have applied and have been chosen to join us- a community that welcomes you and celebrates your unique contributions and background. A community of rights and respect, but also of responsibilities, a training ground for that moment you depart with your degree to take up greater responsibilities outside our gates and in service to those around you. The various programs, services, policies, and processes for which student life is responsible begin with this end in mind. Each are designed to be infused with educational value- everything from deadlines for room selection to standards of civility, from unfailing respect for the dignity of others to things as simple as holding the door for the person behind you at the Campus Center. Every moment is meant to be a part of a unique approach to education and, as Dean of Students, I will work closely with the staff in the offices above and partners across the University to ensure that we support but also challenge you to embrace this experience. I can’t wait to get started… and I hope you can’t either.

Again, welcome to our family here at Rose Hill. You have made a great choice in joining this extraordinary community. See you on campus.

Sincerely,

Dean Rodgers
