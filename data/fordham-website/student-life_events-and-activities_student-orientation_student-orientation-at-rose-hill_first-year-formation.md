# First-Year Formation

## What is First-Year Formation?

The First-Year Formation symposium is designed to assist new students with the adjustment and transition to college life at Fordham.

Sponsored by New Student Orientation and the Office for Student Involvement, First-Year Formation is an extension of the summer and fall Orientation programs. First-Year Formation promotes student engagement in the Fordham academic and co-curricular community and explores the University's distinct Jesuit mission by engaging new students from their very first days on campus. The symposium meets weekly during the fall semester and features sessions that promote skills and topics important for success at Fordham including time management and study skills in college, planning for academic and career success, exploration of personal values, and more!

The symposium consists of a small group of new students and is team-taught by a Student Affairs administrator and an upperclass student Peer Mentor who use a variety of teaching techniques including discussion, weekly reflections, and service-learning to help a small group of first-year students get the most out of their college experience.

## Get "In the Know" at Fordham

Students who participate in the First-Year Formation symposium often comment on the high level of connection they feel to Fordham and that as a result of FYF, they are "in the know". FYF is an excellent course to take for students who are interested in meeting other first-year students, interacting with a student affairs professional and upperclass student leader every week during the fall semester in a small-group setting, and learning about all the resources, services and activities Fordham has to offer.
