# Tips for Transition

Being nervous about starting your college career is normal! The tips below can help you get the most out of your college experience those first few weeks.

-
- Keep them updated: They’ll be glad you care enough to contact them when something exciting happens.
- Let them tell you what's going on with them. Relationships are give-and-take, so it’s important to know what’s happening in their lives too.
- Consider scheduling a regular check-in. Let them know how things are going and what you’re thinking about. A weekly video call may be just what everyone needs.
- But don't be afraid to catch up. Just because you haven’t talked to someone in a while doesn’t mean they don’t want to hear from you.

Being nervous about college is perfectly normal. Everyone around you is feeling the same way. Here are some common concerns you might be having:

Homesickness


This is one of the hardest aspects of the college transition. You will miss your family, friends, and home. But remember that once you visit or go home, everyone will still be there and be proud of your accomplishments!Making Friends


Remember, everyone there is new. They are all looking to meet new friends, so be open-minded and approachable during Orientation. There will also be other opportunities for making friends through classes and club events!Roommates


One of the main things that college teaches is how to deal with different kinds of people. It is crucial that you set ground rules with your roommates and suitemates early on. Each resident freshmen is assigned a Resident Freshmen Mentor that can be used as a resource.Academics


Your college courses will likely be harder than your high school courses and your GPA may drop from high school to college, but that doesn't mean you aren't doing well. It means you are taking more challenging classes in a college environment.Heath and Wellness


Staying healthy and active is important. Devote time daily to yourself for exercise, meditation, or a nap. We have an on-campus gym for you to use, and Central Park and Hudson River Park are great places for you to jog, rollerblade, or bike to stay active.Safety


Fordham University has 24-hour security at both campuses and in all of our residence halls. When it comes to outside safety, be aware of where you are going, with whom and what time. There's always safety in numbers, so explore the city with friends.Commuter Concerns


There are many ways to get involved on campus if you are a commuter. Start with the Commuter Student's Association. It's a great way to connect to fellow commuting students. Clubs are also a fun opportunity to meet both commuters and residents and participate in on-campus activities as well as off-campus excursions. -
Here are some tips for keeping in touch with your student during the first few months of college:

**Be clear about your expectations for contact**. Set a standard early with which you and your student are comfortable to talk and catch up. You may want to set a standard day (Sundays are popular) and let your student initiate the call, or just randomly drop them a text to see how their week is going.Once you’ve established a routine, it will be easy to remain a part of your child’s life during their college career.

**Rely on technology**. Use text messaging, social networks, email, or instant video or chat programs to reach out. Phone conversations, especially at the beginning, can be awkward and emotional for everyone.**Send an (unannounced) care package**. Students enjoy getting mail! It reminds them that there is a world outside of their college life. Packages do not need to be huge boxes that are difficult to carry across campus; a letter from home, some pictures and some of his/her favorite candy are perfect reminders of your love, especially during finals and midterms.**Starting Points for Conversations with your Student**

Allow students space to talk and be a good listener. Asking too many questions at once or overly specific questions may lead to your student feeling overwhelmed. Some basic questions that might spark more personal ones are:- How has your first year been so far? Has it met your expectations?
- How are your classes and professors? Are they interesting?
- What do you do outside of class? Did you join any clubs?
- Have you met anyone interesting?
- How are your high school friends doing?
