**Submitting Your Application**

On or after the dates above, you will be able to access the housing application at [My.Fordham](http://my.fordham.edu/). You must complete all sections that apply to you.

Changes to the application may not be made online after submission. If changes need to be made after submitting the application, please email the requested change to the appropriate campus housing office: [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#dba9bea8b7b2bdbea9b39bbdb4a9bfb3bab6f5bebfae) or [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3f4d5a4c5356595a535c7f59504d5b575e52115a5b4a).

**Room Assignments**

Please understand that all housing assignments are made on a first come, first served basis once your online application has been received. We will do everything we can to grant your first choice and preferences, however, we cannot guarantee that requests will be accommodated. Please bear in mind that undergraduate first years may be assigned to triple rooms. Triple rooms are the same price as double rooms, but if the room is a converted triple, the room rate will be reduced. Please view the room rates for 2025-2026 for further details.

In mid-July, you will receive move-in instructions and will be notified of your room assignment, which will include your room number, campus phone extension, mailing address and the name and contact information for your roommate(s) by an email sent to your new Fordham University email account. If you do not have access to email this summer, please notify us and we will send your housing assignment by mail.

**Triples**

Due to high demand for University housing, some double rooms in [Loschert Hall](/student-life/living-on-campus/living-on-campus-at-rose-hill/residence-halls/first-year-student-housing/loschert-hall/), [Alumni Court South](/student-life/living-on-campus/living-on-campus-at-rose-hill/residence-halls/first-year-student-housing/alumni-court-south/), [Queen’s Court,](/student-life/living-on-campus/living-on-campus-at-rose-hill/residence-halls/first-year-student-housing/queens-court-residential-college/) [Martyrs’ Court](/student-life/living-on-campus/living-on-campus-at-rose-hill/residence-halls/first-year-student-housing/martyrs-court/), and [Tierney Hall](https://www.fordham.edu/student-life/living-on-campus/living-on-campus-at-rose-hill/residence-halls/upper-classmen-student-housing/tierney-hall/) will be converted to triple rooms at a reduced cost. Students living in these converted rooms will pay a reduced rate only while living with an additional roommate and will have the option to move if space becomes available. When space becomes available, students in triple rooms may be required to de-triple into these open spaces and the housing charge will be adjusted to the higher rate. Students living in the standard triple rooms in [McMahon Hall](/student-life/living-on-campus/living-on-campus-at-lincoln-center/mcmahon-hall/) pay a lower rate than for the standard double rooms, but they should not expect to be de-tripled. If you are interested in this type of housing, please check the appropriate box on the online Housing Application.

Designed triples in [Loyola Hall](/student-life/living-on-campus/living-on-campus-at-rose-hill/residence-halls/first-year-student-housing/loyola-hall-residential-college/) and [Faber Hall](https://www.fordham.edu/student-life/living-on-campus/living-on-campus-at-rose-hill/residence-halls/first-year-student-housing/faber-hall/) will be charged the standard room rate.

**Wait List**

Students are guaranteed housing if they were in housing the previous year, or if they were accepted with housing by the Office of Admissions. Other students can apply and be granted housing based on availability. There is no set timeline on when or if a student will receive housing. As vacancies arise we will call and offer students housing. This may be a day or two before the start of the semester or after the semester starts. Housing in the fall is usually tighter than housing in the spring. More space generally becomes available during the spring semester. However, this may change from year to year.

**Housing Withdrawal**

If at any time you no longer desire on-campus housing, an online housing withdrawal form must be submitted for either the [Rose Hill](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSddheKWrG9x61sBcluH3Jka0UGPuzEgP3h3yPXwhvJuzQsn3Q/viewform) or [Lincoln Center](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSehkhxA2459CIDZcL6eZ9ZefiHpPvCHORj0eE2nG_5qX0JWbQ/viewform?embedded=true) residential offices. Housing charges may be incurred, which can be found at the online application.

**Fordham’s Housing Guarantee**

All undergraduate students admitted with housing have a right to housing for four consecutive years, **as long as there is no break in occupancy**. Students will need to participate in room selection and submit their $200 housing deposit for the following academic year. If a student withdraws from housing or is dismissed, the right is revoked. Once a law student at Lincoln Center or graduate student at Rose Hill receives housing, the right to housing extends only through May of the current academic year.
