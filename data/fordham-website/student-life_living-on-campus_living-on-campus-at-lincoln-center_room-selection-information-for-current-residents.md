**An Inclusive Community**

The Office of Residential Life respects the identities of all our students and will work with residents on housing options with respect to their self-identity. We will work with any students on a case-by-case basis to find an appropriate assignment.

If you would like to discuss the process further, and learn more about how to ensure that you will be able to live in a space appropriate to your identity, please contact Vickki Massy, Associate Director for Housing Operations at Lincoln Center at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or by calling the Office of Residential Life at 212-636-7100.

You may also simply indicate in the housing application that you would like to discuss your specific housing needs and preferences further. A member of our staff will reach out to you.

It is important to note that students should inquire about your options as early in the process as possible and while the widest range of options are available. This is a private process and information related to student identity is considered confidential and shared only with staff who need to assist with your request.

We wish you the best of luck in this year’s room selection process! Please do not hesitate to [contact us](/student-life/living-on-campus/living-on-campus-at-lincoln-center/about/contact-and-map/) if you have any questions or concerns.
