## Room Retention Process

#### Monday, March 2

The room retention process allows a select number of current residents to retain their apartments for the 2026-2027 academic year. McKeon residents are **not** allowed to retain rooms in McKeon Hall. For McMahon Hall, students on floors 2 - 5 are not eligible to retain their apartments. Please note that particular apartments will be unavailable for the summer. This means that if your Spring 2026 housing assignment is your Fall 2026 housing assignment, you may not be able to stay in your apartment during the Summer 2026 term since the Office of Campus Operations may be renovating certain apartments Summer 2026. You will be placed in an alternate housing assignment for the Summer (if you apply for Summer housing).

Retainment Eligibility

- To retain a 4 person apartment: at least 3 of the 4 students must be current (Spring 2026) residents of the apartment and a fourth eligible resident must be chosen to fill the apartment
- To retain a 6 person apartment: at least 4 of the 6 students must be current (Spring 2026) residents of the apartment and 2 additional eligible residents must be chosen to fill the apartment

Directions for Retention

## Room Selection Time Slots

- An individual timeslot will be emailed to every resident who pays a deposit, completes the housing application and is eligible to participate in the room selection process.
- Timeslots will be assigned with priority given based on Graduation Year, with law and grad students picking first followed by seniors/juniors, then sophomores, then freshmen.
- The Group Leader should be the member of the group with the best timeslot. Time slots will not be averaged unless you have group members with mixed graduation years.

## Students Studying Abroad

Students Studying Abroad for the Spring 2026 Semester: Students who are currently studying abroad should be able to participate in the housing room selection from abroad. If you encounter any difficulties, please email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9eecfbedf2f7f8fbf2fddef8f1ecfaf6fff3b0fbfaeb).

Students Studying Abroad for the Fall 2026 semester returning to housing for Spring 2027: ORL recommends that students who plan to study abroad for the Fall 2026 semester go through the housing room selection process in case plans to study abroad change. Once a student confirms that they are studying abroad for Fall 2026, they can withdraw from housing by completing an online withdrawal form. Residential Life will contact you in November of 2026 to discuss your Spring 2027 housing options. Please note that ORL will not hold any rooms for Spring that were obtained by students who decide to study abroad in Fall.
