# Living on Campus at Rose Hill

![Building - LG](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/fu_042010_0445.jpg)

## More Than a Place to Live

Unlike other homes, where life is tailored more to the individual, this home is a community of learners collaborating on a project characteristic of and guided by values we hold dear: Jesuit and Catholic traditions. This project is the training of students to take leadership roles in service to the people and communities outside our gates. The Residential Life [Mission](/student-life/living-on-campus/living-on-campus-at-rose-hill/about/mission/) will echo throughout your experience on campus.

In essence, our campus is the classroom and the lives we lead in it are the lessons, the actions and decisions we take forming the habits of our hearts, and these habits the character with which we leave this community once ready. Like the best classroom experience, this one is challenging and the standards for its successful completion are high.

These standards, often in the form of the policies and responsibilities that complement the extraordinary privilege of membership, give meaning to our University’s assurance at [Commencement](https://www.fordham.edu/commencement/) that our graduates are ready to serve the world with both mind and heart.
