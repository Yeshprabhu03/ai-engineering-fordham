# Rose Hill Integrated Learning Communities: First Year Programs

## Integrated Learning Communities

Fordham University has a proud history of approaching learning in a distinctly Jesuit way, one that assures that learning occurs inside and outside the classroom, unites heart and mind and develops in our students authentic conscience, character and intellect.

For First-Year students, there are three unique opportunities to live in an Integrated Learning Community:
