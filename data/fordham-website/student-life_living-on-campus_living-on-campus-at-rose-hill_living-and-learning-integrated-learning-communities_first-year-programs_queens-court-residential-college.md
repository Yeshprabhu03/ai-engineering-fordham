# Queen’s Court Residential College

## A First-Year Community with Purpose

In the [Jesuit education](/about/living-the-mission/campus-ministry/) model of caring for the whole person, living comes together in Queen's Court Residential College. Residents invest their time and talents into a community that pays them back tenfold. The hall is more than a place with [special events](/student-life/living-on-campus/living-on-campus-at-rose-hill/residence-halls/first-year-student-housing/queens-court-residential-college/events-and-activities/) and in-hall classes.

Those who call Queen's Court their home challenge themselves and others to grow in every direction. This builds a tight-knit community that turns neighbors into friends. That's why so many Queen's Court Alumni say: "Once a Queen's Courter, always a Queen's Courter."

[Queen's Court Residential College](/student-life/living-on-campus/living-on-campus-at-rose-hill/residence-halls/first-year-student-housing/queens-court-residential-college/), an intentional community of up to 150 residents, was established to assist in the integration of first-year students into University life. Its inception in 1987 was a response to a felt need for a living experience that would embody the best qualities of a Jesuit education:
