# Campbell and Salice-Conley Residential Colleges

**Upperclassmen Integrated Learning Communities**

In the spirit of Fordham’s mission to cultivate moral leaders for a global society, the Residential Colleges of Campbell, Salice and Conley Halls are designed to meet the unique needs of our senior and junior class students as they develop the transitional skills needed for life after undergraduate education. Recognizing our dynamic and changing world, we seeks to provide opportunities for enrichment with a focus on experiential education, personal growth, and professional fulfillment. Residents should expect to be active participants in a variety of programs and activities intended to enhance their personal and professional development.

A collaboration of students, faculty and administrators, the Campbell, Salice and Conley Residential Colleges provide:

Career and post-graduate specific workshops and support: this could include satellite office hours by Career Services, resources needed to connect your Fordham University education with the ever-changing world of work and graduate study, seminars and networking opportunities with alumni and industry professionals, and workshops focusing on career awareness and assessment, as well as internal and external resources, etc.

Transitions programming: this could include programming around apartment hunting, managing finances, staying connected after college, understanding benefits, "What's That Fork For?" business etiquette banquet, educational happy hours, vocational discernment programming, etc.

Campbell, Salice and Conley halls will offer a number of different types of living arrangements: apartments are designed to house 4 students (either in 4 single or 2 double rooms), 5 students (in 5 single rooms), or 6 students (in 3 double rooms). Over half of the rooms available will be single occupancy. The apartments will be fully furnished and boast air conditioning, climate control within individual apartments, and kitchens equipped with dishwashers and microwaves.
