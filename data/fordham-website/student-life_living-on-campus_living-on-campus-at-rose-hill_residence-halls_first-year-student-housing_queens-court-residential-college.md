[Queen’s Court Residential College](https://www.youvisit.com/tour/fordham/79970?loc=trail39:27:1:1&pl=v), an intentional community of about 150 residents, was established in 1987 to assist in the integration of first-year students into University life.

The [First-Year Integrated Learning Community](/student-life/living-on-campus/living-on-campus-at-rose-hill/living-and-learning-integrated-learning-communities/first-year-programs/queens-court-residential-college/) based on Humanities at Queen's Court embodies the best qualities of a Jesuit education:

- A devotion to learning
- Respect for tradition
- Commitment to community living without the involvement of alcohol or drugs

Queen’s Court is a combination of three halls—St. John’s Hall, Robert’s Hall, and Bishop’s Hall. Each is steeped in the history and traditions of Fordham University.
