In the spirit of Fordham’s mission to cultivate moral leaders for a global society, the Residential Colleges of Campbell, Salice, and Conley Halls are designed to meet the unique needs of our senior and junior class students as they develop the transitional skills needed for life after undergraduate education. Recognizing our dynamic and changing world, the residence halls provide opportunities for enrichment with a focus on experiential education, personal growth, and professional fulfillment.

A collaboration of students, faculty and administrators, the Campbell, Salice, and Conley Residential Colleges provide:

- Transitions programming: events and activities within the halls are geared towards three over-arching themes: Finding Your Passion, Basic Skills, and Your Fordham Bucket List. These programs are meant to encourage residents to prepare for life after Fordham. Additionally, the three halls have partnered with the Office of Student Leadership and Community Development to provide Senior Transitions Programs within the halls.

- Amenities geared toward members of the senior and junior classes: career-related magazines in the laundry rooms, etc.

- Career and post-graduate specific workshops and support: this includes satellite office hours by Career Services, seminars, and networking opportunities with alumni and industry professionals, and workshops focusing on career awareness and assessment, as well as internal and external resources, etc.
