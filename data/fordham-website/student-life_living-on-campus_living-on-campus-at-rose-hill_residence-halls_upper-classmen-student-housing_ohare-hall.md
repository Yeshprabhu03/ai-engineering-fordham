# O'Hare Hall

![O'Hare Hall](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/O_Hare_Hall.jpg)

This three-wing, five-level complex, made up of 13 “neighborhoods” houses 560 students. The majority of the bedrooms are doubles, with a significant number of singles and a small number of triples. Each double and triple bedroom has a private bathroom which is shared with the residents of an adjoining room. Occupants of single bedrooms share a bathroom with one other single bedroom occupant. O’Hare Hall features 13 community lounges (each equipped with living room furniture, a kitchenette, and a TV and DVD player), eight quiet study lounges, and four seminar rooms.

O'Hare's staff consists of two resident directors, 13 resident assistants and two Jesuits-in-residence. These staff members encourage all students to share in the goals of living in a residential college and of a Jesuit education.

O'Hare Hall's architecture facilitates an atmosphere that bridges residents' academic and social needs. The events and activities planned by the [staff](/student-life/living-on-campus/living-on-campus-at-rose-hill/about/staff/) encourage all students to learn and grow. Many programs develop in residents a sense of community and citizenship, which will become essential in life after graduation.

O'Hare Hall Residential College is also home to 4 Integrated Learning Communities:
