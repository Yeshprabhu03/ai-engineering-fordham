## Off-Campus Independence with On-Campus Convenience

Terra Nova House residents enjoy furnished apartments in University-operated buildings. Off-campus houses are staffed by a Resident Director and Resident Assistants and are maintained by the University. The Belmont Community Housing program offers similar services and benefits as those offered within the on-campus housing program, coupled with the independence of off-campus living.

Available every night from 10 p.m. until 5 a.m., this service is free for all Fordham students, faculty, and staff.
