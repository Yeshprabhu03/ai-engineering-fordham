Fordham University offers dining plans that are flexible and suited to meet individual needs. Plans can be used at any location on the three Fordham University campuses in both the resident dining (Marketplace) and retail locations.

Declining Balance (DB) add flexibility to your dining options. Various dollar amounts are incorporated into each dining plan and are spent like cash! As an additional value, declining balance dollars are tax exempt.

Dining plans charges will be billed through the university for all students living in resident halls where meal plans are mandatory. Please contact the housing office directly to make dining plan selection.

Meals are provided from the first day of the semester through the last day of exams, exclusive of University closings.
