# What Should I Expect?

Our staff members who work in the halls will guide you in your responsibilities as well as your rights as a on-campus resident.

**Resident Assistants**

During your first days on campus, you will meet your resident assistant (RA). Each RA is handpicked from the student body for his or her ability to lead and act as a role model for students. RAs provide services and program opportunities, but they also guide and counsel students who live on campus. You will also meet our resident directors (RD), who are in charge of your residence hall or housing area. RAs and RDs are important people to get to know.

**Code of Conduct**

One of the roles of our staff is to work with students who may make poor decisions in their conduct or behavior, or who test the limits of the University Code of Conduct. Students arriving for life on campus will find the challenge of personal responsibility and independence an intense and indispensable introduction to adulthood. This, too, is part of a Jesuit education, as the values learned inside the classroom inform the standards for our community and are played out in everyday life at Lincoln Center and Rose Hill. Students should make sure they are aware of policies set for all students, and those specifically for residential students.

**Creating a Community**

The Office of Residential Life supports an overarching vision of creating community in all its efforts. A residence hall community is a group of students engaged in social interaction, possessing common educational goals and experiences, who show concern for and are sensitive to the needs of other residents, and are interested in furthering the group’s goals. Residents share in defining the community’s expectations of members and are held to these expectations by their peers. The Office of Residential Life is sensitive to the rights and responsibilities of all resident students. In an effort to make our community conducive to academic, social, and personal growth, policies have been established to ensure that individual rights are protected and responsibilities are understood.
