# About the Office of Multicultural Affairs

The Office of Multicultural Affairs provides programs, events, and resources that allow our community to connect to various forms of diversity and inclusion while living out the Jesuit principles. Our goals are to:


- Foster and promote an inclusive campus culture where each member of the Fordham University family feels welcomed and valued.
- Provide a variety of resources to our community that proactively explores topics of diversity, including race and ethnicity, gender, culture, sexual identity, socioeconomic status, religious orientation, ability, international concerns, social justice, and oppression.
- Work collaboratively with student organizations, University departments, faculty, and academic offices to develop creative programs and projects designed to enhance intercultural interaction and engagement.

The Office of Multicultural Affairs operates at the Rose Hill campus and the Lincoln Center campus. The majority of our programs are open to all students from all campuses.
