# Office of Multicultural Affairs Full Time Staff

**Juan Carlos Matos**

Juan Carlos (He/Him) is the Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs for Diversity and Inclusion. He feels that the Jesuit tenet of Cura Personalis, care for the whole person, is integral in diversity and inclusive work, and is a core reason for him wanting to join OMA at Fordham University. Before coming to Fordham, he attended New York University, where he received a M.A. in Higher Education and Student Personnel Administration.

Juan Carlos attended the University of Miami for his undergraduate career, where he earned a B.A. in Public Relations and Sociology. Juan Carlos is very passionate about multiculturalism and how we, as a society, can move toward looking at intersections of identity, and how each of us can play a role in making the world a better place for everyone. He oversees the day-to-day OMA operations at both Rose Hill and Lincoln Center campuses.
