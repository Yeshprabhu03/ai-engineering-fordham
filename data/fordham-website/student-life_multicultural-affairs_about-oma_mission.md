# Office of Multicultural Affairs Mission

The Fordham University Office of Multicultural Affairs upholds the University’s mission to honor and revere the dignity and uniqueness of each person, in keeping with the Jesuit and Catholic fundamentals of faith, hope, and love. We foster and promote the formation of an inclusive campus culture and learning environment in which each member of the Fordham University family is welcomed and valued.

The Office of Multicultural Affairs creatively collaborates with all University constituencies to develop programs and initiatives designed to enhance student-learning opportunities. These essential partnerships support our endeavor to fully leverage the positive effects of diversity on student learning and development.

Through holistic leadership development initiatives, we support the continued development of the multicultural competencies of enhanced awareness of oneself, knowledge of cultures varied from one’s own, and the skills necessary to communicate cross-culturally.

We seek to engage the entire Fordham community in thoughtful and authentic dialogue by providing space for reflection and exploration of the self, and reciprocal exchange and learning among the entire student population.

We are devoted to proactively opposing injustice and oppression both domestically and internationally. We continuously challenge ourselves and the community at large to be globally minded change agents committed to viewing the world through a lens of social justice.

While we serve as a resource for all members of the community, we support the recruitment and retention of historically underrepresented students, be it by race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, religion, ability, or sexual identity. We provide intentional support for these students, with a vision of the entire University sharing that responsibility.

The Office of Multicultural Affairs invites all members of the Fordham University family to be curious! We encourage the openness of mind and willingness of heart to learn, explore, ask questions, and enjoy competent intercultural interaction.
