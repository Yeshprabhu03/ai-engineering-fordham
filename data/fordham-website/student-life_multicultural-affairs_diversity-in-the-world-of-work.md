# Diversity in the World of Work

The Office of Multicultural Affairs works collaboratively with Career Services to provide programs and events that integrate diversity, inclusion, and the workplace throughout the academic year.

These events are open to Rose Hill and Lincoln Center students and aim to create opportunities for a wider variety of participation from underrepresented student populations.

These events include:

- The Diversity in the World of Work Conference (spring semester)
- The Diversity Networking Banquet (DNB, spring semester)
- Diversity Inclusion Employer Panels (fall and spring)

To learn more about these events please visit the Career Services [Diversity Inclusion Initiatives](/resources/career-resources/career-center/about-us/diversity-inclusion-initiatives/).
