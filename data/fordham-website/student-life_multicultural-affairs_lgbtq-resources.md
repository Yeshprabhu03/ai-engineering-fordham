# LGBTQ Resources

The Office of Multicultural Affairs coordinates, co-sponsors, and supports a number of LGBTQ and Ally Network of Support focused events and programs on campus that educates the campus community and raises awareness about the experiences of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning, and Ally members of the Fordham community. These events are planned by our office in collaboration with student organizations and other departments on campus. All of these programs are grounded in the Jesuit tenet of Cura Personalis, or care of the whole person.

Some of the resources available on campus include:

- The LGBTQ and Ally Network of Support

*five-hour training over two days (2.5 hours each)* - Beyond the Network of Support

*Additional workshops, programs, and events* - PRISM Retreat – Campus Ministry, Dorothy Day, and Counseling collaboration

*LGBTQ Spirituality retreat* - Student Organizations

*PRIDE Alliance at Rose Hill and Rainbow Alliance at Lincoln Center*
