# LGBTQ and Ally Network of Support

Principles of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging are central to [our mission as a Jesuit institution](/about/living-the-mission/diversity-and-inclusion/) and connect us to a long Catholic tradition of advocating for the dignity and worth of every person.
