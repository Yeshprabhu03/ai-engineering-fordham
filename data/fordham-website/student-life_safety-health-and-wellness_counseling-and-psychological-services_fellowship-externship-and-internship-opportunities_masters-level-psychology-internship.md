CPS offers a nine-month master’s level internship that commences in August 2026. The internship provides a comprehensive training experience in university mental health with an emphasis on individual therapy, group therapy, crisis management, and outreach to a diverse undergraduate and graduate population of approximately 15,000 students. CPS approaches clinical work, supervision, and training through an integrative lens, with a strong emphasis on conceptualizing from a psychodynamic and social justice perspective. The internship requires a commitment of 16 or more hours per week. Interns are expected to maintain an active caseload of 10-12 individual psychotherapy clients, see walk-in clients as needed, participate in outreach events, and may have the opportunity to co-lead a psychotherapy group.

Interns will receive 1 hour of weekly individual supervision with a staff member and will be provided with additional supervision for co-leading groups and developing/implementing outreach activities. The internship also includes a yearlong three-hour formal training component every Tuesday from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. that consists of a case conference, group supervision, a seminar on psychotherapy theory and process in the Fall semester, and a multicultural seminar in the Spring semester.

Our counseling center is composed of licensed psychologists, social workers, mental health counselors, post-graduate fellows, and clinical trainees from various mental health disciplines (psychology, social work, mental health counseling, psychiatry, etc.). We value teamwork and have a strong emphasis on working collaboratively across different disciplines.


We accept students from master’s programs in clinical mental health counseling, counseling psychology, school counseling and social work. We work with interns at different levels of training. We are committed to diversifying our staff and to increasing diversity in the field through quality** **training. We welcome and encourage applications from individuals from all religious backgrounds, racial/ethnic minority individuals, immigrants and international students, those who are fluent in other languages, LGBTQ and gender-expansive individuals, second-career/non-traditional-age applicants, individuals with disabilities, and others who are historically underrepresented in the mental health fields.

Completed applications, which include a cover letter, curriculum vitae, transcript (unofficial is fine), and two letters of recommendation, should be sent to Erika Greene at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6306041106060d06525723050c11070b020e4d060716). In your cover letter please indicate if you have a particularly strong preference for the Rose Hill or the Lincoln Center campus, or if you are open to being considered at both campuses. We start accepting applications on December 1, 2025 on a rolling basis until all positions are filled. Priority consideration will be given to applications received by January 20, 2026.
