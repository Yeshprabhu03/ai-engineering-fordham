Fordham University Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS) will offer three postgraduate fellowship positions for the 2026-2027 academic year at the Rose Hill Campus (Bronx, NY) with concentrations in Training & Supervision, Social Justice & Outreach, and International Student Mental Health. The 12-month fellowship will commence on or around August 17th, 2026.


The fellowship carries a stipend of $50,000, full university benefits (described in detail below) and fully meets the licensure requirement of supervised postdoctoral psychology, mental health counseling, and social work hours in New York and many other states. We emphasize generalist practice from a relational psychodynamic perspective, while allowing fellows to develop additional expertise in an administrative area relevant to university counseling (e.g., training and supervision, group therapy, outreach/prevention). We have a social justice-centered equity-based treatment model.


Fordham CPS is committed to diversifying our staff and to increasing diversity in the field through quality training. We welcome and encourage applications from individuals from all religious backgrounds, racial/ethnic minority individuals, immigrants and international students, LGBTQ and gender-expansive individuals, second-career/non-traditional-age applicants, individuals with disabilities, and others who are historically underrepresented in the mental health fields.


**Responsibilities:**

- Provide direct clinical services, including phone triage, brief psychotherapy, group therapy, crisis intervention, and case management, to a diverse undergraduate and graduate student population.

- Participate in CPS’s outreach, prevention and referral services.
- Provide clinical supervision to an extern (second semester).
- Participate in training, multidisciplinary and administrative team meetings.
- Administrative duties as assigned.

**Training Activities: **

- Supervision: Post-graduate fellows receive 2 hours of individual supervision per week from a staff member and a licensed psychologist. Supplemental supervision is provided for additional activities such as co-leading groups or conducting outreach.
- Seminars: Fellows meet weekly with Training Director and other staff members for case conferences, psychodynamic didactics, multicultural seminar (fall semester), and supervision of supervision seminar (spring semester).
- Concentration: Each fellow completes a year-long concentration as an "assistant coordinator" in one area (training and supervision, social justice and outreach, or international student mental health), shadowing/learning from and supporting the activities of the staff member responsible for that area of CPS' operations.


**Qualifications: **

- Completed Doctorate in clinical, counseling or school psychology or related field (ABD candidates may be considered), OR completed Master’s degree in mental health counseling, OR completed Master’s degree in social work.
- Experience with providing short term and group psychotherapy in a community or university mental health setting.
- Commitment to providing multicultural counseling and conceptualizing from a psychodynamic framework.
- Ability to work collaboratively with a diverse university community of students, faculty, administrators and families.
