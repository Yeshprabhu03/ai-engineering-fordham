# CPS Statement and Resources on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice

Principles of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging are central to [our mission as a Jesuit institution ](/about/living-the-mission/diversity-and-inclusion/)and connect us to a long Catholic tradition of advocating for the dignity and worth of every person.

*Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS) is committed to the delivery of culturally competent services that honor and are responsive to the needs, strengths, and identities of Fordham’s diverse community of students, faculty, and staff. CPS recognizes that ecological and systemic inequality, injustice, and oppression continue to exist and have a negative impact on the mental and emotional health of our community. For this reason, CPS intentionally, actively, and continuously strives to develop and provide services that contribute to the promotion of social justice, inclusivity, and equality.*

American Psychological Association's (APA) Guideline for Providers of Psychological Services to Ethnic, Linguistic, and Culturally Diverse Populations

CPS is committed to rendering services in accordance with [APA's Guidelines](https://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/policy/provider-guidelines) for Providers of Psychological Services to Ethnic, Linguistic, and Culturally Diverse Populations. These guidelines are reflected in the following areas:

Accessibility: CPS is committed to providing information verbally and in writing to meet the language and accessibility needs of our students. Our staff are also able to provide clinical services in multiple languages (view [CPS Staff and Trainee Bios](/student-life/safety-health-and-wellness/counseling-and-psychological-services/staff-and-trainees/) for most updated information), and are able to provide off-campus referrals if we cannot meet a student’s specific language needs.

Clinical Practice Guidelines: CPS staff remain updated on current ethical, professional, and practice guidelines for working with diverse populations, and have received graduate and post-graduate training on the intersections of culture, identity, mental health, and clinical practice. We are aware of the need for, and are committed to, ongoing professional development and education in these areas.

Cultural Humility: CPS staff are committed to practicing cultural humility when working with students, especially those from underrepresented or underserved populations, and/or who have experienced identity-based stressors or traumas. We strive to continuously reflect on and examine our own cultural backgrounds, privileges, values, prejudices, and biases in the context of our clinical conceptualization of and work with students. We also recognize that there are intra and inter-cultural differences in the manifestation of mental, psychological, and emotional health concerns, and strive to customize our clinical interventions to reflect the cultural backgrounds and experiences of our students.

Systemic, Sociopolitical, and Environmental Context: CPS staff recognize and consider the impact of institutional, systemic, sociopolitical, and environmental stressors and inequities in the context of assessing and providing clinical services to students. These stressors and inequities include, but are not limited to, microaggressions, discrimination, intergenerational trauma, lack of representation in higher education, and disparities in access to health care, food, shelter, education, and other basic needs.
