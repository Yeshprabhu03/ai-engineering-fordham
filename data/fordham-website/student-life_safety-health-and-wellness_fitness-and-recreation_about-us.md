# Fitness and Recreation: About Us

Built in 1959, the McGinley Center is Rose Hill's "living room," where students socialize, attend events, work out at a fully equipped fitness center, and dine at the Marketplace and Dagger John's. Named in honor of Laurence J. McGinley, SJ, president of Fordham University from 1949 to 1963, the student center is also home to the Office of Career Services, Campus Ministry, and the Office of Student Leadership and Community Development.
