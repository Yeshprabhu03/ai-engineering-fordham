# Emergency Medical Services: About Us

Presently Fordham University EMS holds certification from the New York State Department of Health as a basic life support emergency response agency. Through the utilization of our two ambulances and membership, FUEMS provides fast and effective emergency medical care to the Fordham University community. As a growing agency in a University setting our goals extend beyond just merely providing emergency care but also providing continuing education for our current active members.

- FUEMS has been recognized by Fordham University United Student Government as "USG CLUB of the Year for 2013-2014."
- FUEMS most recently has been recognized by Fordham University United Student Government as "USG CLUB of the Month for September 2014" and is back in the running for USG Club of the Year for 2014-2015.

Thank You to all of our members for all of your hard work and dedication!
