# Immunizations

Visits are by appointment.

We carry several immunizations (HPV vaccine, MMR vaccine, Meningitis vaccine, Influenza vaccine, TB screening and testing, etc.) at the University Health Services for a minimal charge. We also provide several travel immunizations for a minimal charge. Please contact the UHS for more information.
