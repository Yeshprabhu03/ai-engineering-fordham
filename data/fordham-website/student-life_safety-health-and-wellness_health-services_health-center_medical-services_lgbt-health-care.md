# LGBT Health Care

The staff at the University Health Services are committed to caring for the health needs of our LGBT students. Our staff are members of the Ally Network of Support and treat all students with dignity and respect. We work closely with the Oval Center of Excellence at Montefiore in keeping up to date with the best practices in caring for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students.
