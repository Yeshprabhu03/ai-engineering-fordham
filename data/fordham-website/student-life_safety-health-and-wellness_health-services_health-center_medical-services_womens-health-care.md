# Women’s Health Care

Women's Health Care services are available for all female students at the Rose Hill and Lincoln Center campuses five days per week by appointment.

Services include:

- Routine gynecological examinations
- Pap smears
- Sexual transmitted infections testing
- Pregnancy testing.

Treatment and related counseling are confidential and always offered in a nonjudgmental manner.

Neither contraceptives nor birth control are distributed or prescribed on premises as a standard practice. University Health Services' staff do make limited exceptions in writing appropriate prescriptions for the treatment of an existing medical condition accompanied by supporting documentation. There is no charge for GYN exams, and associated laboratory fees will be billed by laboratory services and will be the student's responsibility. Discounted rates are available if students prefer to pay (please contact the office for a fee schedule).
