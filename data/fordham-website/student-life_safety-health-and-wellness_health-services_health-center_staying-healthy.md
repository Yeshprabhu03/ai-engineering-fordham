# Staying Healthy

This section will include timely and pertinent health-related information to keep you well informed and updated on current health related issues.

**Vaccinations**

A hold cannot be removed until all documentation is received.

New York State Law 2165 requires all students born on or after January 1, 1957 to demonstrate proof of immunity against measles, mumps and rubella. Students must submit documentation from their physicians or former school health officials stating that they have had the necessary vaccinations, or copies of lab work (titers), demonstrating immunity from these diseases. Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccination is available at the University Health Services. The UHS does not accept insurance. If you will like to receive reimbursement from your insurance company you will be able to obtain a receipt after your visit.

New York State Law 2167 requires that all students have either received a meningitis ACWY vaccine within the past 5 years, or a complete series of Meningitis B vaccine, or have signed a meningitis response form. The response form indicates you have been educated regarding meningitis and the meningitis vaccinations and either will get the vaccines or decline the vaccines. The meningitis vaccines are available at University Health Services. You can access the meningitis response form in your student health portal. It can also be found on page 4 of the downloadable immunization form at our website Fordham.edu/health.

The most effective policies and procedures to prevent the spread of any contagious disease, including MRSA is to focus on:

**Flu (Influenza) Facts: Is it a cold or is it the flu?**

Many illnesses begin with influenza (flu)-like symptoms, which include fever, tiredness, and a dry cough. And most are not caused by flu . Because these symptoms can be caused by many diseases, it can be difficult to tell what caused you to become sick. Your best protection against the flu is an annual flu shot. You should especially get this protection if you are 65 years old or older, or have certain medical conditions that put you at high risk of flu-related complications. The flu shot can prevent illness caused by influenza but cannot prevent flu-like illness caused by other diseases.

**Smoking Cessation: Did you know that there are many options available today to help you stop smoking?**
