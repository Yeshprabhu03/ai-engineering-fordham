# Public Safety: About Us

## Public Safety and the Fordham Community

Your personal safety is important. With your assistance and cooperation, we will provide the services, staffing, and guidance to assure your safety. An effective security program relies upon the active participation of every student, faculty, and staff member.

We provide you with information about a variety of security services, programs, and policies. A number of University departments, including residential life and student activities, produce informational materials in more detail than found here.

We encourage you to contact these departments for more specific information, if and when desired.

[The Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act](/student-life/safety-health-and-wellness/public-safety/about-us/clery-act/) requires all colleges and universities that participate in federal financial aid programs to keep and disclose information about crime on and near their respective campuses.

From the Associate Vice President of Public Safety

The members of the Department of Public Safety are committed to your personal safety. We have allocated the resources necessary to provide a safe and secure environment for the campus community. The policies, procedures, and programs of Fordham University have been designed and implemented to contribute, with your participation and cooperation, to attaining the highest level of safety and security possible. Safety is always a shared responsibility. Any member of the University community who becomes a victim of a crime is encouraged to immediately report the incident to the Department of Public Safety and the local police.

The Department of Public Safety provides 24-hour, 7-day-a-week coverage at the Rose Hill and Lincoln Center campuses. Public Safety personnel are carefully screened before being assigned to Fordham University. They are strictly supervised to ensure quality performance. A duty supervisor oversees public safety personnel on every tour at all campuses. This supervisor is a former law-enforcement professional with extensive patrol, management, investigation, and crime-prevention experience. Public safety personnel respond to emergency and non-emergency calls for service, provide traffic control and enforcement of traffic regulations, and assist in building inspections and fire prevention.

University Public Safety personnel are empowered to:

- Enforce Fordham regulations.
- To investigate incidents.
- Apprehend those who violate University regulations or commit crimes on campus.

Criminal violators who are apprehended are turned over to the local police for arrest processing. When necessary, Fordham University will press charges against criminal violators.

Public safety has a close working relationship with the local New York City police precincts - namely the 48th and the 52nd at Rose Hill and the 20th at Lincoln Center - and the Harrison Police Department at the 400 Westchester campus. The Associate Vice President for Public Safety meets regularly with police commanders to help ensure the safest environment for our campus community.
