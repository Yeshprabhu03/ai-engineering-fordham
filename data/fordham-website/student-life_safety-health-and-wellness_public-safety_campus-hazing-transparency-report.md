# Campus Hazing Transparency Report

*Last Updated January 2026*

In accordance with the **Stop Campus Hazing Act (SCHA) **and section 485(f) of the **Higher Education Act of 1965,** the University publishes a report of any student organization that has been found responsible for hazing.

The Campus Hazing Transparency Report includes, if known, the name of the organization, the date of the hazing behavior, investigation, and adjudication timeline, as well as a description of the findings. Any reports of hazing that did not result in a finding of responsibility are not included. The University will update this webpage as outcomes are finalized, and will share the transparency report and resources with the campus community twice (2) a year.
