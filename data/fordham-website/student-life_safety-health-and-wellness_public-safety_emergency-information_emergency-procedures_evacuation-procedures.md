# Evacuation Procedures

**If a fire alarm sounds or a building evacuation is otherwise ordered:**

- Immediately evacuate the building.
- If you are supervising students, instruct them to remain together.
- Rescue or assist people in immediate danger, but only if you can safely do so without endangering yourself.
- Steer clear of elevators. Use stairways for emergency evacuation.

**Upon evacuation of the building:**

- Assemble any students in your charge at a safe location at least 200 feet from the building and determine if everyone was evacuated.
- Report the names of anyone missing to the emergency response personnel along with their last known location.
- Do not attempt to reenter a building that has been evacuated until public safety personnel advises that it is safe to do so.

**If a physically challenged occupant is unable to exit the building:**

- Notify the fire warden of the person’s location.
- Avoid transporting the individual up or down stairwells without the assistance of emergency personnel.
- Relocate the individual to an area of refuge on the same floor that is separated by a set of closed fire doors, preferably in close proximity to an evacuation stairwell. (Do not attempt if there are imminent life-threatening conditions.)

**If circumstances prevent you from evacuating the building:**

- Remain in your room, office, or workplace with the door closed.
- Call the Department of Public Safety.
- Prevent smoke and heat from entering your room by blocking all openings.
- Use wet towels or clothing, if possible.
- If smoke is present in your room, remain close to the window. If possible, hold a wet towel to your face and stay low to the floor.
- Do not open or break the window glass unless absolutely necessary. The source of oxygen may intensify a fire or allow smoke to enter your room.
- Hang a white towel or brightly colored clothing out a window to alert emergency response personnel.
