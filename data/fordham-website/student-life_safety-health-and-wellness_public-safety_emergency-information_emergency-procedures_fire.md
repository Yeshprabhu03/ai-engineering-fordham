# Fire

Fire safety is important. Everyone should be observant and aware of every exit in any venue they enter.

** As soon as you become aware of a fire: **

- Pull the nearest fire alarm device or make sure an alarm has already been sent.
- Notify the Department of Public Safety (see numbers below).
- If fire occurs in your room, leave immediately and close the door behind you.
- Follow the directions of fire wardens, public safety personnel, resident assistants, or resident directors.
- Follow building evacuation directions. Never go to the roof.
- Exit quickly and move at least 200 feet away from the building. Do not remain in lobby or near entrances as first responders need access for their personnel/equipment.
- Notify fire wardens/public safety personnel of the location of anyone injured or with physical challenges still within the complex. If safe to do so, assist them to a secure location close to an evacuation stairwell.
- Never let fire get between yourself and the exit.
- Stay away from elevators. Use the stairs only.
- Stay out of smoke-filled rooms.
- Check doors before opening. If they are warm to the touch, do not enter.

Note: Extinguish a fire only if you are trained to use a fire extinguisher and an alarm has been sent.

**If evacuation is not possible:**

- Remain in place and keep the door closed.
- Call the Department of Public Safety, if possible to do so, and advise them of your exact location.
- Prevent smoke from entering your location by blocking openings. Use wet towels or clothing.
- Do not open or break the window glass unless absolutely necessary. Oxygen will intensify fire.
- If smoke is present in your room, remain close to the window. If possible, hold a wet towel to your face and stay low to the floor.
- Hang a white towel or bright clothing out a window to alert first responders.

Follow the directions from public safety personnel as heard on the public address system.
