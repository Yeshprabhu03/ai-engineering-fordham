# Hazardous Material Spill

**If a hazardous material spill occurs outside:**

- Stay upwind of the material if possible.
- Warn others to stay away from the material.

**If a hazardous material spill occurs inside:**

- Warn occupants in the spill area to evacuate immediately.
- Try to leave the building without passing through the contaminated area.

* Note: Always follow directions from emergency responders.

**You should:**

- Call the Department of Public Safety
- Be prepared to give the following information:
- Building name
- Floor number
- Room number
- Type of incident
- Material involved (if known)
- Estimated volume of material(s) involved
- Remove any contaminated clothing and wash all areas that came in contact with the clothing or the hazardous material. Use large amounts of water for 15 minutes (a safety shower is preferable) to completely remove any traces of contamination.
- Seek medical attention for yourself or anyone else directly exposed to the material.

**Note:** If you are thoroughly familiar with the hazards of the material, have been trained to use and have access to appropriate personal protective equipment, you may attempt to confine the spread of the spill as much as possible. Do not risk contaminating yourself.**If a radiation hazard is present:**

- Warn others and remain as far away from the hazard as possible.
- Take advantage of any large dense obstructions or materials that can readily be used as shielding between you and the radiation source.
- If you are outside, get inside to reduce exposure.
