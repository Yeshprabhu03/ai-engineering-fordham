# Shooting Incident

**Suggested Response by Students/Faculty/Staff/Visitors**

**In the unlikely event of an active shooter at a Fordham campus or building remember:**

**Escape**, getting away is always the safest and best option.**Hide**, in a secure room behind a locked or barricaded door.**Fight**for your life and team up with others to swarm, overwhelm, and subdue the attacker when possible.

Because active shooters situations are always unpredictable and dynamic, there is no one correct response. While none of us likes to think about the worst-case scenario, thinking through a plan of action beforehand can significantly increase our chances of survival and help keep our campuses safe. Although it may seem like we hear about these attacks routinely in the news, statistically, it is still highly unlikely that you will ever encounter an active shooter. So, to keep ourselves and our campuses safe we may have to take decisive action and escape. hide or fight to survive.

## Here's What To Do In Case Of An Active Threat On Campus

### Escape

If you sense trouble it is always best to just ESCAPE from the danger if you can, always look for an alternative way to escape, other than the way you came in. Remember from a distance people often mistake gunshots for firecrackers. So be alert for the sounds of gunshots and take immediate note if you see or hear people screaming or running. It’s always safer to escape first and ask questions later. Leave your bag and your laptop behind. Your life is more important Just get as far away as fast and quietly as you can. Take note of the nearest exits in any facility on campus. Alert others to danger and help them escape if you can Whenever possible it’s better to split up and run in different directions if you are with a group of other people.

### Hide

If you are in a hallway or open area during an active threat emergency and you can’t easily escape try to find a secure room where you can stay hidden and out of direct sight. Remember to lock your door and turn off the lights. Every obstacle you create could buy you crucial extra time to escape or react to an attacker. If you are in a group of people avoid gathering in one area. Instead spread out to different hiding spots around the room. You never want to give the attacker a concentrated target. Make sure your phone is set to silent mode. Remember a vibrating phone can still make enough noise to give away your hiding spot. Avoid attracting attention to yourself. Active shooters typically look for quick and easy targets. The harder you are to see or hear, the safer you’ll be. Of course, it’s normal to be scared in this situation. Taking deep breaths will help you stay calm and quiet, while focusing on what you need to do to survive. Discreetly notify Fordham Public Safety or contact 911 if you can do so safely. If you can’t talk you can text 911. You can also use the Alertus app to quietly and discreetly notify Public Safety

### Fight

If it comes down to a last resort and you can’t run away or hide. Then do whatever you can to frustrate, slow down or stop the attacker. In the very worst-case scenario that you find the threat closing in on your location, you need to be ready to fight. Stay calm, focus, and mentally prepare yourself to fight for your life. Look for things that you can use as a weapon. If you’re with other people, you should all swarm and attack at the same time. The more people that join in, the more likely you can quickly overwhelm and subdue a gunman before they can do more harm. It’s natural to hesitate to use violence, but in this situation, that’s the worst thing you can do.

Don’t be afraid to use all your strength. You have nothing to lose by fighting as hard as you can. Hit them as hard as you can, as many times as you can with any type of weapon you can find. When you are fighting for your life, there are no rules. Aim for the attackers most sensitive areas like the eyes, nose, groin or throat. Bite, kick, stab, or punch do whatever you have to do to win. Separate the attacker from their weapon if you can, BUT DO NOT PICK UP THE WEAPON. You don’t want anyone to mistake you for the attacker. Remember, statistically active shooters have a very short window to commit violence before the police arrive. Every second an attacker is frustrated or slowed down, could help save lives.

**If you have immediate information on the attacker’s movements or location, call the NYPD or discreetly text Fordham Public Safety using the Alertus app.**

**Keep in mind that the priority of the police is to stop the attacker first and foremost. Officers will not attend to the injured until the active threat has been stopped.**

**Calls to the Department of Public Safety and 911 should state, if known:**

- The location of the shooter(s)
- The number of shooters
- The types of weapon(s) the shooter has
- The number of victims at the location
- A description of the shooter(s), including gender, race, distinguishing features, clothing or identity

**When Law Enforcement Officers Arrive on the Scene:**

- Remain calm and follow directions
- Immediately raise hands and spread fingers
- Avoid quick movements towards officers
- Avoid pointing, screaming, and yelling
- Don't stop officers but proceed in direction from which officers are entering premises when evacuating.
