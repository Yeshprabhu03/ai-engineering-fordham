# Off-Campus Shuttle Information

The Office of Student Affairs and the Department of Public Safety have expanded the neighborhood shuttle to transport students and staff to and from the Rose Hill Campus. Similar to Ram Van Service between campuses, the shuttle will provide passengers with a reliable, comfortable and safe mode of transportation. A security guard will operate this van on a regular route, pick up and discharge at designated locations and return to the Rose Hill Campus. Our neighborhood shuttle will be offered free of change and will operate 7 days a week between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m. during the Fall and Spring Semesters.

Shuttle 1 will leave campus every 30 minutes beginning at 8 p.m. Students and staff on campus may access this service by coming to the Department of Public Safety at Thebaud Hall Annex. Students and staff off campus may notify public safety and meet the van at designated stops along the route to return to campus.

Fordham students and staff wishing to use this service must present a current valid FORDHAM identification card to board the van, must identify and accept responsibility for their guest on the van, must comply with all directions from the guard/driver and are responsible to comply with all University policies.
