Inspired by the Ignatian tradition of the Magis, these students serve as active change agents and leaders in service striving to continuously improve the quality of student life at Fordham University. They plan events and develop campaigns to increase positive behaviors on and off campus and decrease the harmful effects associated with the misuse and abuse of alcohol and other drugs.

BeWellLC provides accurate information and opportunities for the exploration of personal goals and values that challenge and empower students to make safe and informed choices. By taking this proactive approach, these students hope to increase awareness and challenge all students to play a role in transforming the culture of alcohol and other drug use on campus.
