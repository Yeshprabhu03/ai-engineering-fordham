# Information about AODE for New Students

AODE coordinates the on-campus efforts at the Lincoln Center campus, and is located in the Office of Student Involvement. The AODE Program includes prevention, education, and early intervention efforts by using educational classes, awareness campaigns, alternative programming, and informational training sessions with orientation leaders, resident assistants, and other student leaders on campus. These efforts are aimed at assisting students to make healthy and socially responsible decisions throughout their four years at Fordham.

Students also play a vital role by participating in BeWellLC, the student run organization on campus that exists to educate the Fordham community in the areas of alcohol and other drug alternatives as well as general health and wellness activities including healthy relationships, stress relief, mental health, etc., with the goal to promote social responsibility and provide support for peers in all aspects of their lives while at Fordham University. All students are welcome to join this organization or partake in the many prominent programs sponsored by them or AODE, including:

- National Alcohol Awareness Day
- Safe Spring Break Campaign, to promote responsible behavior during spring break
- Open forums to discuss various topics relating to drugs and alcohol
- Health and wellness programming activities

AlcoholEdu for College and Sexual Assault Prevention Required for All Freshmen

As a part of our comprehensive approach to alcohol and other drug prevention, Fordham University requires all new students to complete an online, non-opinionated alcohol prevention program as well as an online, interactive module to inform students about the critical issues of sexual assault and relationship violence. Similar programs are used on hundreds of campuses nationwide, which use science-based research to educate students about alcohol and its effects as well as how it connects to sexual assault. Whether a student chooses to drink or not, these programs empower them to make well-informed decisions about alcohol and substance use and help them better cope with the drinking behaviors of their peers. Students will be emailed in July with course log-in information as well as a deadline to complete the program.
