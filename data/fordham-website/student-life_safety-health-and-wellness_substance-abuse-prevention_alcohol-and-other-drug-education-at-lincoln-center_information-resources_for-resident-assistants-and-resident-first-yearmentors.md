To download a bulletin board guide, right-click on the appropriate link and "Save." For each bulletin board (in the form of a Power Point), change the fonts and colors to your liking and add or delete information based on your bulletin board's theme. Printing directions are on the first slide of each guide.

Be creative with the design!
