# AODE Resources for Student Leaders

The goal of the AODE program is to unite faculty, administrators, students and staff alike in creating an environment that fosters healthy lifestyles and reduces the potential risks associated with alcohol and drug misuse to the Fordham Community. One of the ways the AODE program is dedicated to this goal is by educating student leaders including Resident Assistants and Freshman Mentors, Orientation Captains and Leaders, and Urban Plunge Assistants. AODE student leader training includes healthy dialogue pertaining to the use and or abuse of alcohol and other drugs, how to have conversations with students they may encounter who are at risk and Bystander Intervention.

If you are interested in hosting an event that fosters healthy lifestyles and reduces the potential risks associated with alcohol and drug use and misuse please contact [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7d1c121918111e3d1b120f19151c1053181908) to collaborate.
