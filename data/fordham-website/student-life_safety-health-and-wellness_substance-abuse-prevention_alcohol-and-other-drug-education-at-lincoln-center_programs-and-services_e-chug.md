# e-CHUG

**What is the e-CHUG?**

The e-CHUG (electronic Check-Up to Go) is an interactive web survey that allows college and university students to enter information about their drinking patterns and receive feedback about their use of alcohol. The assessment takes about 6-7 minutes to complete, is self-guided, and requires no face-to-face contact time with a counselor or administrator.

**What Does it do?**

When you access the e-CHUG, you are prompted to enter information about yourself. In addition to demographic information, it will ask you to enter information about your drinking habits, family history, and to complete the World Health Organization’s AUDIT.

After all information has been entered, you submit the form. The information you entered is then validated and processed. The e-CHUG calculates a number of variables and compares your responses to national and local college norms. Then, your personalized feedback is displayed in standard HTML format.

**What do I need to use the e-CHUG?**

You need:

- A computer
- Internet access
- A JavaScript enabled Internet Browser

(Note: The e-CHUG has only been tested on Internet Explorer 5.0+ and Netscape Navigator 4.79+) - About 6-7 minutes
- A printer (to print the feedback)
