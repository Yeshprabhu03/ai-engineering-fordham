Beginning in September 2009, the Alcohol and Other Drug Education (AODE) office formally implemented the AODE Safe

Birthday Campaign. With the assistance of the Office of Student Involvement, Office of Residential Life and the Commuter Freshman Program, the Safe Birthday Campaign addresses high-risk drinking birthday celebrations for first-year students and students turning twenty-one.

Students receive a card prior to their birthday that contains self protective strategies (safe drinking tips), a personalized message (from their Resident Assistant, Resident Freshman Mentor, or Commuter Freshman Mentor) and a list of popular locations in New York City to celebrate without drinking alcohol.
