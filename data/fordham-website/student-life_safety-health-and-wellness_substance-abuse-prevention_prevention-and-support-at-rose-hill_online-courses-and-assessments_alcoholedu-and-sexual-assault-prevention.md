# AlcoholEdu and Sexual Assault Prevention

**AlcoholEdu**

As part of Fordham University’s comprehensive approach to alcohol abuse prevention, all new students enrolled in Fordham College Rose Hill, Fordham College Lincoln Center and the Gabelli School of Business are required to complete *AlcoholEdu for College*.

Used on over 500 campuses nationwide, the course uses science-based research to educate students about alcohol and its effects.

In addition to providing alcohol education for all new students, AlcoholEdu collects survey data from students as they complete the course. All survey responses are strictly confidential; Fordham University will only receive information about the student body as whole and will never see individual students' answers.
