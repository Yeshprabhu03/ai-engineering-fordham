[Q. What is Prevention & Support and SBI?](null.html)

The Office of Prevention & Support coordinates’ substance abuse prevention, education, early intervention, and assessment at Fordham University. These initiatives are part of a comprehensive, integrated strategy that is science based and inherently student centered. “Screenings and Brief Interventions (SBI)” is a program facilitated by the Prevention & Support staff for students mandated from departments at Fordham.

Once students have contacted The Office of Prevention & Support, they will be assigned a counselor who will assess the student's use of drugs and alcohol.

[Q. What happens if I miss a meeting?](null.html)

We ask that you try to contact us in advance via phone or email if you know you are going to miss a meeting. If you miss a meeting, it is your responsibility to contact us as soon as possible in order to reschedule. If you do not reschedule, we will notify the Office of Residential Life and this may lead to further disciplinary sanctions for failure to comply.

[Q. How did I get referred to Prevention & Support?](null.html)

You may have been referred to the Office of Prevention & Support for several reasons. Many students are referred by a Resident Director or another administrator on campus. Prevention & Support does not decide whether or not a referral should occur. We are responsible for ensuring that referred students are able to complete their requirements. If you have any questions about why you were referred, please contact the administrator that you met with or who referred you.

[Q. How will I be treated by Prevention & Support Sta](null.html)ff?

We treat all students with respect and professionalism, whether they have been mandated to us or have come voluntarily for assistance. We are not disciplinary officers and will not attempt to convince or force you to change. We do follow set procedures and guidelines, so at your first meeting you will be asked a variety of alcohol and other drug screening questions in order to assess your use and risks. Following your Screening and Placement Interview, you will be placed into an appropriate educational intervention.


[Q. What is a brief intervention?](null.html)

What we have noticed over the years is that many students mistakenly believe an intervention is a dramatic event reserved for people who have a serious alcohol or drug problem and are in denial. In fact, brief interventions have very little in common with this misperception. According to the National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the goals of brief interventions, “differ from formal alcoholism treatment. Brief interventions generally aim to moderate a person’s alcohol consumption to sensible levels and to eliminate harmful drinking practices, rather than to insist on complete abstinence from drinking—although abstinence may be encouraged, if appropriate.” The educational interventions we utilize have been designed for college students and provide opportunities for insight and the presentation of accurate information related to alcohol and other drug use.

[Q. How many meetings does it take to complete my SBI requirements?](null.html)

SBI (Screening & Brief Intervention) begins with a (approximately thirty minute) Preliminary Screening and Placement Interview with a staff member. Following the Preliminary Interview, a student is placed into an appropriate educational intervention. Interventions are typically 2-3 sessions in length and may be done individually with a staff member or in a group (Choices). While the subject matter is different, all interventions last the same amount of time. Following the intervention, the student may need to complete a 15 minute follow-up or an online survey.

[Q. Will I get into trouble if I’m honest about my alcohol and other drug use?](null.html)

No. Prevention & Support holds the utmost respect for student privacy. Any information shared during a session relating to the use of alcohol or other drugs will not be used against a student to incriminate or “get them into trouble.” Limits and parameters of confidentiality are discussed more fully during the first session.

[Q. Are Prevention & Support sessions counseling?](null.html)

While personal issues related to alcohol and other drug use may arise during your sessions, Prevention & Support staff members do not serve in the capacity as counselors at Fordham. Since personal issues are at times related to substance use, Prevention & Support staff often refers students to Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS), which is located on the Lower Level of O’Hare Hall. To learn more about CPS, visit their website at: [http://www.fordham.edu/cps](/student-life/safety-health-and-wellness/counseling-and-psychological-services/).

[Q. What if I have been referred to BASICS?](null.html)

BASICS (Brief Alcohol Screening Intervention for College Students) is a two session program facilitated by a member of the Office of Substance Abuse Prevention and Student Support staff. Generally, students are mandated directly to BASICS following a conversation with an administrator. During the first session, you will receive additional information and will complete a survey. Between sessions you will be assigned a 6-7 minute online survey (e-CHUG or e-TOKE) which must be completed before your next meeting. During the second session, you will receive personalized feedback based on the data collected during the first session. Each session is approximately an hour in length.
