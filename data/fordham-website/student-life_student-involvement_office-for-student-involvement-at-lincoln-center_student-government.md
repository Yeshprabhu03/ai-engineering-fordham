# Student Government at Lincoln Center

The student government for undergraduate students at the Lincoln Center campus is comprised of three governing bodies; United Student Government, Commuting Student Association, and the Residence Hall Association.

## United Student Government

USG is the student government body representing all students from Fordham College at Lincoln Center and the Undergraduate Gabelli School of Business at Lincoln Center. Their purpose is to provide a voice for student concerns in the University Community and act as a governing mechanism for the solutions of student problems while ensuring proper and equal representation for all students. In order to maintain visibility among the student body, USG will provide social and educational programming for the student body and its organizations. USG fosters a sense of community and maintains the means to a clear dialogue among the faculty, staff, and students.
