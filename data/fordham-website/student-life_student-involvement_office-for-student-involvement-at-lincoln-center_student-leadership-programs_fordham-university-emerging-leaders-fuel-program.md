# Fordham University Emerging Leaders (FUEL) Program at Lincoln Center

Leadership skills learned during your experiences at Fordham can be translated into your years after college. FUEL is a Leadership Development Program offered through the Office for Student Involvement that is specifically targeted to first- and second-year students.

**Program Goals**

The FUEL program is a semester-long series of workshops conducted each spring which focus on first- and second-year students who have been recognized as having outstanding leadership potential by professors, administrators, and fellow students. Some of the qualities these students may possess are: involvement in clubs or activities on/off campus, outstanding class participation, and leadership in group projects.

**Workshop topics include: **

- Ignatian leadership
- Creative problem solving
- Public speaking
- Diversity in leadership
- Stress management
- Networking and mentorship

Through workshops, seminars, guest speakers, and interactive sessions, students will learn valuable leadership skills and have the opportunity to develop self-confidence and increase self-awareness. FUEL helps to bring these characteristics out in students in order to benefit the students, their clubs, and the Fordham community as a whole. It is our hope that characteristics developed as a result of participation in the FUEL program will go on to serve students in their everyday lives.
