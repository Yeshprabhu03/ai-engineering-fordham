Fordham University offers a variety of leadership programming focused on holistic development that students can participate in.

The Leadership Initiatives Committee, under the advisement of the Assistant Director for Student Leadership and Engagement in the Office for Student Involvement, serves the community by developing a campus environment where students complement their academic experience with co-curricular leadership opportunities outside of the classroom.

The student-led committee oversees the following leadership opportunities:

- Leadership Weekend Retreat (Spring Semester)
- Fordham University Emerging Leaders Certificate Program (Spring Semester)
- National Jesuit Student Leadership Conference (Summer Semester)
