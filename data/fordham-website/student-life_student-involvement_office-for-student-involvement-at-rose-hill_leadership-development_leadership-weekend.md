# Leadership Weekend

Leadership Weekend is a one-night, two-day off-campus retreat taking place at Ramapo on **February 27-28, 2026**, and is designed for students at all stages of their leadership development—from those just beginning their journey to established student leaders on campus.

This immersive weekend experience offers a blend of fun and meaningful discussions, interactive activities, presentations, and guided reflections focused on leadership growth. Students will have the opportunity to share their experiences with one another while learning about Fordham’s wide range of leadership resources and opportunities.

Leadership Weekend is open to students from all class years and provides a supportive environment for building community, strengthening leadership skills, and exploring how leadership shows up both on campus and beyond.

This experience is free for students who are selected to participate through an application process.

**Applications for Leadership Weekend have been sent out to all Rose Hill Undergraduate Students at this time and are due on Tuesday, January 20, 2026, at 12PM.**
