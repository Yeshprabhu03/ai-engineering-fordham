# Student Government and Programming Leadership at Rose Hill

The student government for undergraduate students at the Rose Hill campus is comprised of three governing bodies; Campus Activities Board, Commuting Students Association, the Residence Halls Association, and the United Student Government.

## Campus Activities Board (CAB)

The Campus Activities Board (CAB) works in conjunction with the Office for Student Involvement to provide social, cultural, educational, and informational programming to the Fordham Community. As the primary programming entity on the Rose Hill Campus, CAB seeks to develop student leaders dedicated to high quality programs and entertainment.

## Commuting Students Association (CSA)

The Commuting Students Association (CSA) is one of the three governments on campus, dedicated to representing the commuting student body of Fordham University.

The organization is comprised of student representatives of Fordham College and the Gabelli School of Business on Fordham’s Rose Hill campus. We strive to provide a single voice for commuting students, develop and implement policies, services and programs, and represent commuting students’ particular needs and concerns.

## Residence Halls Association (RHA)

The Residence Halls Association (RHA) is a vital part of student life at Fordham. The general board is made up of sixty-eight members from all of the thirteen residence halls. Every spring the General Board elects seven members to serve on the executive board. The seventy-five member government is responsible for the following:

- Act as a programming organization
- Improving student life through policy initiatives
- Make Fordham a more serviceable and livable community
- Act as a liaison between the students at Rose Hill and the staff and administration at Fordham.
