# Rose Hill Campus Activities Board

The Campus Activities Board (CAB) works in conjunction with the Office for Student Involvement to provide social, cultural, educational, and informational programming to the Fordham Community. As the primary programming entity on the Rose Hill Campus, CAB seeks to develop student leaders dedicated to high quality programs and entertainment.

CAB is made up of nine different committees and a larger general board which all have specific missions and goals. Throughout the year CAB hosts large scale events that are run by the entire board as well as smaller events that are managed by one of the ten committees. The general board members assist the committee chairs by staffing events, preparing event space, marketing and publicizing upcoming programs and brainstorming new program ideas.

## Mission

The Campus Activities Board consists of nine committees chaired by students and a general board of student volunteers whose combined purpose is to provide the Fordham student community with services of an educational, social, cultural and informational nature. CAB may cooperate with, and complement, any group of the Fordham community seeking to offer educational, social, cultural, and informational programming for Fordham University, while working along side the Office for Student Involvement to achieve these goals.
