The Campus Center Operations Team manages the Rev. Joseph M. McShane, S.J. Campus Center and multiple other venues. The McShane Campus Center is designed to be a hub of campus involvement and activity and was named by the Board of Trustees in honor of Fordham University's 32nd president. The McGinley Ballroom, named in honor of former President Laurence McGinley, S.J., is located in the Campus Center's older 1957 wing and is accessed through this new and modern main building.

In addition to managing the other Campus Center facilities (Collins Auditorium, Campbell Multipurpose Room, Bepler Commons and Rodrigue's Coffeehouse), the Campus Center Operations Team also schedules and supports non-academic events in other Rose Hill campus spaces.

McShane Campus Center venues are equipped for business conferences, lectures, and meetings, for up to 300 people. Located in the capital of the world, New York City, the McShane Campus Center offers a solution to any conference and event planner's problems. Examples and information regarding different available venues are featured on this site.

The McShane Campus Center at the Rose Hill Campus is the headquarters of a bustling Office for Student Involvement program. It hosts many student services such as student organization offices, dining options and several Student Affairs offices. As the "Living Room" of the campus, it is a place for students to socialize, attend events, and truly enjoy their collegiate experience.
