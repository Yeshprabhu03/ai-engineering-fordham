The Campus Center Operations Team coordinates facility use and event service logistics for the Rose Hill campus. The Campus Center venues are equipped for business conferences, lectures, and meetings, for up to 500 people. Located in the capital of the world, New York City, the McShane Campus Center offers a solution to any conference and event planner's problems. In addition to managing other facilities (Collins Auditorium, Campbell Multipurpose Room and Rodrigue's Coffeehouse), the Campus Center Operations Team also schedules non-academic events in other Rose Hill campus spaces.
