The Departments in Student Services (RH, LC, and WC) offers a variety of resources and programs to support students outside the classroom in their academic achievement, educational goals, personal growth, and professional development. These services advance overall student development and become an integral component of the educational process, with the ultimate goal of strengthening learning outcomes.

Consistent with our Jesuit tradition and overall Student Affairs divisional mission, staff offering these services are committed to responding to the full spectrum of diverse student needs and abilities. Students are encouraged to take advantage of these services and are actively engaged with administrators in the planning process, from the development of new programs discussed in small and informal focus groups, to formally administered assessment instruments.

Students who have questions or problems with these services should feel free to contact the respective directors or the Dean of Student Services. Student Services departments include:
