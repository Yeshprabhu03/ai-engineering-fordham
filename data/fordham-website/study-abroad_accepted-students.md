Once you have been approved to study abroad and admitted to your study abroad program, you will need to begin to plan for your semester abroad. Please log in to your study abroad portal to complete the required post-decision documents. Carefully review the information found in the handbook in your account. General information on [costs](/study-abroad/costs-and-funding/), [health, and safety](/study-abroad/health-and-safety/) can be found on this website.

All accepted study abroad participants receive a copy of the [Fordham Study Abroad Handbook](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/pdfs/jadu-single-folder-pdfs/Pre_Departure_Study_Abroad_Handbook.pdf) or the Fordham Study Abroad Short-Term Handbook to help them prepare for their program.

## Mandatory Pre-Departure Orientation

All accepted students are required to attend a Pre-Departure Orientation. At the Pre-Departure Orientation, we will provide information about your upcoming study abroad experience.
