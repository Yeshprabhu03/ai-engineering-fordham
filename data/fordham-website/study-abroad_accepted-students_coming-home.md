# Coming Home from Study Abroad


![Student stands in front of a small red car](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/study-abroad/Website-pic-6.jpg)

Your study abroad experience doesn't have to end once you return home. Your new insight and knowledge are needed by others. The International and Study Abroad Programs Office encourages you to stay involved by supporting your community, to share your story of this once-in-a-life-time experience, and to take advantage of all the new opportunities for which you are qualified.

This page contains further resources for students returning from a program abroad. Please contact our office if you have any further questions about returning from abroad.

Returning home after your study abroad experience isn’t always straightforward. Now that you’re back you might see some things have changed. Noticing these changes (and knowing they are completely normal) can help you adjust. Look out for the following:

**Reverse homesickness:**It’s normal to miss the friends you’ve made and the city you called home whilst studying abroad. Try not to resist this; allow yourself time to adjust to being back home. How might you be able to bring your experience abroad into your day to day life?**Relationships have changed:**Think about how you can support your family and friends to accept the person you’ve become while you’ve been away.**Value your experience:**Remember the family and friends you’ve returned to will want to hear about your experience but they can’t share it. Don’t allow this to frustrate these relationships.**Balance:**Finding adventure and excitement in the everyday, just as you did while studying abroad, can help you find and maintain a balance as you adjust to being back home. What were parts of your routine abroad that you may be able to introduce to your routine at home?**Fitting in:**You need to fit back into your life at home, with family and friends, your Fordham campus, your studies. Think about how to do this healthily and happily. What do you need?Should you like to discuss readjustment home further, please feel free to schedule an appointment with the Office of Study Abroad or reach out to Counseling and Psychological Services as needed.

Please complete your Program Evaluation upon returning from abroad. Our Staff reads each program evaluation and are made available to prospective study abroad students to assist them in researching their programs. Complete your Program Evaluation online by logging into the Study Abroad Portal at

[my.fordham.edu](http://my.fordham.edu/).We encourage you to be thorough and honest in evaluating your study program or university because our office relies heavily on these forms when we review our study abroad program roster. Your voice helps us maintain the highest possible standards when looking at study abroad programs. Your evaluation serves another equally important purpose as your peers - future study abroad students - read about your experiences with great interest. Your program evaluation can help them make decisions regarding their own study abroad plans.

**Language Exchange Program**

Language Exchange Program is organized through[Institute of American Language and Culture (IALC)](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/academic-resources/esl/). The purpose of this program is to give students an opportunity to practice a foreign language with a native speaker (ESL students, who speak English at various levels).For example, if you are an English speaker interested in practicing your Spanish, you will be paired with a native Spanish speaker interested in practicing English. The program not only helps to keep your foreign language skills sharp, but it brings you in contact with a different aspect of the region where you have studied abroad. It is also a great way to share knowledge and your experience with your conversation partner’s native language and culture.
