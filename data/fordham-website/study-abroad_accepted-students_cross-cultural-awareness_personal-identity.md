# Personal Identity

As gender-based norms abroad may differ significantly from your native culture, be aware that it can affect your experience abroad. It is important to understand the role of gender in the culture in which you are living. Observe how the host country’s people dress, behave, and treat members of different sexes. Also remember at all times that what may be appropriate or friendly behavior in the U.S. may bring you unwanted, even dangerous, attention in another culture.

**Race, Ethnicity and Socio-Economic Status**

Be aware that because of your race or ethnicity, you may be accorded different privileges or experience different barriers abroad than those you experience at home. Different cultures define race and ethnicity differently, create different categories and expect different things of people within these categories. Different cultures have ideas and perceptions about socio-economic status, which may not be the same as those in the US. Consider where your program is located. If it is in a city, are you living in an affluent or middle-class neighborhood? Where is your host university or study abroad program located? Once you arrive at your destination, take cues from your surroundings and as you go about your everyday routines observe your host culture.

**Sexual Orientation**

It is important to be aware of the cultural, legal and social issues regarding sexual orientation and gender identity abroad and how they could affect interactions in your host country. Since many ideas we have about sexual orientation and sexuality are culturally based, students need to be aware of how this will affect their relationships with their host culture, cultural adjustment, and the overall study abroad experience.

**Disability**

Travel is always a challenge to a person's problem-solving abilities; this is no different for a person with a disability. While overseas, people with disabilities will likely find some things inaccessible, but preparation and persistence can help.
