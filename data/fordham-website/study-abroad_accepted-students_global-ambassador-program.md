Hi! I’m Cameron, a junior majoring in Political Science, and I’ll be spending the semester studying abroad in South Korea through Fordham’s exchange program with Sogang University in Seoul. I’d say 80% if this decision was based on eating Korean food, and the rest was the opportunity to spend an extended period of time in Eastern Asia and immerse myself in a culture so different from what I’ve experienced before. Korea specifically stood out to me because they put so many cool things out into the world recently, so I was very intrigued.
