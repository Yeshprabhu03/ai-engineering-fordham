![Student sits on rock in front of ocean](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/study-abroad/Cooper-Wilson-1.png)

**Passport**

You will need a valid passport to study abroad and it should be valid for at least *12 months* from the end of your study abroad program. If you need to apply for or renew your passport, start before you submit your study abroad application!

**Visas**

Many countries require that foreign students have a visa, an official document giving permission to enter a country. It may be in the form of a stamp imprinted on a page in your passport or it might be an official document which includes a photograph. As they vary from country to country, you need to check for up-to-date visa and entry requirements with your program and the consulate/embassy.

To apply for a student visa you may need to visit the consulate nearest your permanent address or in New York City depending upon the country. When applying, make sure to check what documents you will need to submit along with your visa application and fee. These might include: your passport, a letter for immigration authorities, and the acceptance letter from your study abroad program/institution. You may also be required to submit one or more photographs, evidence of financial support during your period of study abroad (i.e. bank statement), and proof of medical insurance.

- We will provide a letter confirming enrollment in your Study Abroad Program
- Visa applications typically can be submitted 3-6 months before travel
- If your visa requires an in-person document submission, you will not have your passport while your visa is processed. You will not be able to travel internationally during this time, and US citizens must have a Real ID in order to fly domestically. If your passport is your only official government-issued ID, you should obtain another form of ID before applying for a visa
- If you are planning to study abroad in more than one country in a year, you must check the visa requirements for both countries. It is usually not possible to apply for a visa from outside of your home country.

**Notary**

Some visa application documents may require you to sign them in the presence of a Notary. You can [book an appointment with a member of the study abroad office team who is a notary here](https://www.fordham.edu/study-abroad/contact-us/). Please bring your unsigned documents and proof of identification with you to your appointment.
