![Students stand on cliffside](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/study-abroad/SAB-banner-2.png)



**Apply with Confidence**

*Fordham University monitors each study abroad program location closely and may cancel programs or revoke program acceptances if there appears to be a significant health, safety, or security risk in that location. Should a program be canceled before your departure, your application fee will be refunded. We will also work with you to identify an alternative location or semester for study abroad or work with you to continue your studies with Fordham University.*
