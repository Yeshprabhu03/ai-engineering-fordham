# Full-Term Study Abroad Policies

In order to apply for approval to study abroad, you must find the program in our search page and click "Apply Now." Please review the study abroad guidelines below for eligibility information.

-
Opportunities for full-term study at foreign destinations are open to juniors in good academic standing (GPA of 3.00 or better) and a clear disciplinary record. First semester Fordham College sophomores who otherwise meet the requirements may study in Fordham’s London Liberal Arts program for the Fall semester only. Applications from students who do not meet one of these requirements will be considered on a case by case basis and may undergo additional review.

All applicants must complete the online Fordham Study Abroad Application in the Study Abroad Portal. This requires the submission of a

**Statement of Purpose and Goals Questionnaire**, a**Faculty Recommendation**(from the student's declared or intended major) and a**Study Abroad Recommendation Form**from the students class dean (GSB students) or academic advisor (FC students). Applications that might require additional consideration are reviewed by the International and Study Abroad Programs Faculty Advisory Board. This committee’s recommendations are**final**. -
In addition to the academic policies of Fordham and your major department(s), the following policies apply:

To secure necessary approvals and the transfer of credits, students are required to submit all application forms to the ISAP office on stipulated dates. Participants must make sure their projected study abroad credits do not exceed the number of transfer credits allowed to receive a Fordham degree (generally 60). Students must register for a regular full-time course load abroad which is the equivalent of 15-18 credits per semester.

Fordham College students must obtain major/minor department approval and GSB students must obtain approval from the Assistant Dean of Global Programs for courses taken abroad towards majors or minors by completing the electronic course approval form in the Study Abroad Portal. Program forms requesting official university approval must be signed by Fordham’s Director of Study Abroad.

Grades earned abroad are recorded on a student’s transcript, but with the exception of those Fordham-taught courses in the Fordham in London programs and Fordham in Granada program are not calculated in the student’s GPA. Courses cannot be taken on a Pass/Fail basis and must be offered in-person (virtual or online courses are not allowed). A grade of C or better in each course is required and courses must be the equivalent of

*3 credits*at Fordham to transfer; Credits for duplicate courses will not transfer.Students applying to programs in non-English speaking countries may take a program language placement test. Since a poor placement may require doing course work abroad that amounts to duplication of courses already taken at Fordham, it is recommended that you not leave a “gap” in your language study.

Fordham students enroll in the equivalent of 15-18 US credits during their semesters abroad. Fordham students can only receive credit for courses with at least 3 Fordham credits. When selecting your courses, keep in mind that many universities outside of the United States use a different credit numbering system for their courses. The information below will help you in selecting the appropriate number of courses at your host school. If your program is not listed below, it likely follows the same grading and credit systems as Fordham. Please contact the office if you have questions.

Fordham in London, Fordham in Granada, Exchange, and Partner Programs' tuition is the same as traditional undergraduate per-term Fordham tuition in NY. Given the student's continuing eligibility, all Fordham financial aid will be portable for approved study abroad programs except room-specific aid, work-study, and Metro Grants. For all study abroad programs, as long as all eligibility requirements are met, students eligible for a Pell Grant, a New York State TAP grant or student loans can apply this aid toward their study abroad charges. Tuition Remission, Tuition Exchange, and FACHEX can be applied to the cost for Fordham in London, Fordham in Granada, and Exchange Programs only. Additional fees that cover the cost of housing, insurance, orientation, co-curricular activities, etc. will be also be charged. Additional fees such as the Study Abroad Fee, Technology Fee, General Fee, and Insurance Fee will be charged.

-
Financial holds preclude all registration activity, including acceptance into the study abroad programs.

Fordham’s Online listing of Approved Study Abroad Programs is extensive. ISAP will not process applications to programs offered by universities and organizations with which Fordham does not have affiliation agreements.

These are current study abroad guidelines and policies. Fordham University reserves the right to withdraw or modify any of these, and/or to cancel a program or modify a program's itinerary to ensure its successful operation.
