[Fordham Summer Programs](/study-abroad/programs/summer-programs/) & [Global Seminars](/study-abroad/programs/global-immersion-seminars/)

Fordham University offers a series of Short-Term programs during the Winter intersession, Spring, and Summer. These programs are taught by Fordham faculty and range in academic discipline. They are ideal for students who may not be able to afford to study abroad for an entire semester, and who are interested in learning outside of the classroom. These programs are interdisciplinary, engage in the site abroad, and consistent with Fordham’s mission as a research university in the Jesuit tradition. The short-term programs will include organized co-curricular excursions and group academic activities.

If you decide to apply for a non-Fordham program during the summer or winter inter-session you must complete our [application](https://fordham-ip.terradotta.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ViewProgram&Program_ID=10300) as well as an application with the provider company or institution your program is administered by.
