Students in the Fordham in Granada program will have the opportunity to choose between a homestay or a student residence hall living arrangement.

In a homestay, participants will live with a Granadan family for the semester. Homestay families provide breakfast, lunch, and dinner daily, as well as a supportive, immersive environment for participants to acclimate to their new surroundings.

There are typically two students assigned to a homestay. Students may be placed in single or double rooms depending on availability and will have a separate bathroom from their host families that may be shared with another student. Housing placements are typically within walking distance of the CLM.

Student residence halls offer a more traditional dorm experience, where participants would live with other students studying at the CLM, offering additional opportunities to develop community. Student residence halls will offer breakfast, lunch, and dinner six days a week (Monday - Saturday), excluding holidays.

Homestays and student residence halls will provide the following:

- Bed linens and pillows
- Wifi
- Washing machines (in some homestays)

Once accepted into the program, students will complete a housing form to indicate their housing preferences for their semester abroad.

Special medical housing requests can only be considered upon completion of the Fordham University Office of Residential Life Special Housing Request Process prior to completion of your housing questionnaire in the Study Abroad Portal.
