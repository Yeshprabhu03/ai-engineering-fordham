Fordham in Granada is based at the CEA CAPA study center and is centrally located and close to the [Universidad de Granada](https://www.ugr.es/). Participants are offered individualized tutoring services and can expect their academic progress to be supported by program staff. Intercambio (conversation exchange activities) are also available to students, coordinated through the CLM. All program participants have Universidad de Granada insurance, and are granted access to all Universidad de Granada and CEA CAPA facilities.


Participants will engage in a number of cultural excursions within Granada as well as take short trips to other parts of Spain, Portugal, and Morocco. In previous Fall and Spring terms, the program visited Sevilla, Córdoba, Nerja, Ronda, Guadix, Cabo de Gata, Portugal’s Algarve region, and Morocco where they met with local students and lived with Moroccan families.

The area surrounding Granada also offers opportunities for activities beyond the city, including options to ski at one of Spain’s best resorts or enjoy the tropical climate and beautiful beaches of the nearby Mediterranean Sea. Granada is a very walkable city but you can also take a quick ride on the bus or light rail to these attractions.
