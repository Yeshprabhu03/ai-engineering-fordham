William Loschert is the retired chairman of ACE Global Markets Ltd. He was a founding member of ACE Limited, eventually relocating to London where he was named their chairman. He would later hold a position on the council of Lloyd’s, becoming the first American to do so.

In 2021, Loschert was knighted by the Vatican. The papal honor was bestowed on him for his longtime support for the church, including helping make possible the canonization of Saint John Henry Newman in 2019, as well as his support of Fordham.

Loschert’s gifts to Fordham established an endowed chair in entrepreneurship, and have funded scholarships, construction at the Rose Hill campus, and a lecture series at Fordham’s London campus. Loschert served for six years on the university’s Board of Trustees and has hosted more than 1,000 Fordham students at his home in London. He is a trustee fellow of the university.

Loschert received an honorary degree from Fordham in 2015, and the Founder’s Award in 2018. In 2009, Rose Hill’s Loschert Hall, formerly known as Alumni Court North, was named in his honor.
