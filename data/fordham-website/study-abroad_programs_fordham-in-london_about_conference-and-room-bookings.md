**Fordham’s London Centre** opened in 2018 to provide a new home for Fordham University’s study abroad programmes. The Centre is located in the vibrant Clerkenwell neighbourhood, with the British Museum, the Barbican, and St. Paul’s Cathedral all within walking distance. The Centre boasts state-of-the-art teaching facilities as well as exceptional communal and event spaces.

The Centre underlines Fordham University’s commitment to a global education. Sitting in the heart of Clerkenwell, an area known for its industrial past which is now home to many creative industries, the Centre provides students, staff, faculty, and visitors an impressive working and learning environment.

We are keen to work with businesses, charities and local organisations for the benefit of the wider community and the following pages provide booking information for our rooms and event spaces.
