## London Area Hotels

Fordham families and friends often like to stay close by the centre when they visit. Here's a list of popular hotels near our building. Please note that student accommodation is not all co-located with the London Centre, and you may explore other neighborhoods in order to be closer to an assigned accommodation location.
