# Fordham London Student Activities

## Orientation

The London experience begins with a comprehensive orientation that acquaints students with health, housing, travel, academic, and safety information. Following Orientation, Fordham London organizes a series of activities as part of Welcome Weekend (your first weekend in London) and these activities may include small group walking tours of London as well as events for the wider student group, such as a Boat Cruise or Bowling Night. Program costs typically include co-curricular activities in and around the city of London.

## Social Calendar

**Each semester, the Student Affairs team prepares a program of optional social events, trips, and visits to the theatre or sporting matches, otherwise known as their ‘social calendar’. Fordham London sponsored trips are day-long excursions or weekend trips subsidized by Fordham for you. Past Fordham London trips include a Stonehenge and Bath Day Trip, Lake District Hiking Weekend, Windsor Castle and Eton Day Trip, and a Wales Preseli Adventure Weekend which included surfing, sea kayaking, and other activities. Students can expect to receive their social calendar in advance of their study abroad semester so that they can sign up for events and organized trips in advance. In addition to these programs, the student programming committee will release tickets and plan events throughout the semester in and around the city that participants will not want to miss.**

Past activities include Bingo Nights, London Eye tickets, and England soccer tickets.

## Program Trip

As part of your study abroad experience, a weekend trip is included with our Gabelli Business and Liberal Arts programs. These trips are considered a key component of your study abroad program and the costs are covered by your program fees; except for personal spending money.

Past program trips have visited cities such as Rome, Lisbon, and Vienna.
