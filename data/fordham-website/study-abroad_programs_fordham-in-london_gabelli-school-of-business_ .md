**Locations:** London, United Kingdom

“I deeply valued the independence and confidence I gained from this experience. Having the freedom to structure my own schedule, balancing classes, personal responsibilities, social life, and travel, was incredibly empowering. I am incredibly grateful for this opportunity and all the valuable lessons I learned. It was an enriching and unforgettable experience that I would wholeheartedly repeat.”

— Divya Naraine, Fall 2024

[Fordham’s London Centre](/study-abroad/programs/fordham-in-london/fordham-london/)is located in the Borough of Camden in Central London, in a neighborhood called Clerkenwell.The United Kingdom—England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland—is a diverse place full of contrasts, featuring a wide range of landscapes and cultures. London, the largest city in Europe, is a bustling cosmopolitan center of astonishing variety and interest that a visitor could explore for months without turning over every stone. The other regions of the U.K. are fascinating for their own reasons, each with a unique personality and history.

While based at Fordham’s London Centre, students may choose to venture from Cornwall in the far west to the Highlands and Islands of Scotland in the north. Cities such as Edinburgh, York, Durham, Chester, and Canterbury are reachable by an excellent rail network, as are areas of great natural beauty, such as the Lake District, the New Forest, and North Wales. And it’s only a quick trip to the Republic of Ireland or France, Spain, and Italy in continental Europe.

-
Students are housed in shared student residences in residential areas in Zone 1 or 2, both of which offer a commute by public transport to classes at the London Centre and your chosen host university. The residences have self-catering facilities with a shared lounge. All of our housing is centrally located in London, in areas with shops and transportation and within reach of city attractions.
