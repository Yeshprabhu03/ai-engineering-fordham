# Summer

At the heart of Fordham's study abroad programs is the idea of the world as the classroom. Small and informal class settings let students explore subjects from a new perspective and in a unique setting. Students engage with the city of London inside and outside of the classroom. Situated in the vibrant Clerkenwell district in the Borough of Camden, Fordham London will serve as your home-base while studying abroad in London.

"One of the things I valued the most about studying abroad in London was the incredible cultural experience. Every day there was a new opportunity for me to explore historical landmarks, visit world-class museums, and interact with people from all walks of life. The overall experience made me more open-minded and appreciative of global diversity. " - Jaden Ovalle, Summer 2023
