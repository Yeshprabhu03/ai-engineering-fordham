*Description:*The Camino de Santiago is the traditional pilgrimage route from France across northwestern Spain to Santiago de Compostela, the legendary burial site of St. James. One of the great medieval pilgrimages and the greatest surviving itinerary for medieval monuments and landscapes, it has enjoyed a remarkable revival in recent years, attracting European Union sponsorship, the attention of media stars, and hundreds of thousands of walkers and pilgrims. In this two-week study tour, participants will walk the route, and meet each day for lectures and discussion of the medieval and pre-modem monuments along the route. The group will meet periodically during the spring 2026 semester to discuss reading assignments and prepare for the walk. An extended essay is required at the end of the course.*Instructor:*Maria (Christina Bruno) & David Myers - *instructor permission needed**Travel Dates:*Friday May 22nd- June 8th, 2026*Location:*Camino de Santiago in Spain
