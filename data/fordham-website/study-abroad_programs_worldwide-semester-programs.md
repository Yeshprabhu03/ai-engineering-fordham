## Courses and Credits

When studying at a non-Fordham semester program, the courses you take would be **transfer credits**. In order for a course to transfer back to Fordham, it must meet the below conditions:

- Course must be the equivalent of 3 Fordham credits
- You must receive the equivalent of a Fordham "C" grade or better
- Course must be taken for a grade. Pass/Fail classes cannot transfer
- Course must be taught in person, online courses are not allowed
- Course cannot be a duplicate of course you have already taken

As a part of the post-acceptance process, students are required to seek approval for their courses through the online Fordham study abroad course approval form. Study abroad transfer credits, with approval from the appropriate departments, may fulfill core, major, minor, or concentration requirements. Study abroad transfer courses and grades appear on students' Fordham transcripts, but they do not factor into students' Fordham GPA.
