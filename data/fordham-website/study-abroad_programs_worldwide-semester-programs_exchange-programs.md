Fordham University has exchange partnerships with universities worldwide. These programs have been developed with the independent student in mind. Courses are often taught in the language of the host country, and the majority of your classmates will be students from your host country. Studying on one of our exchange programs allows you the highest level of academic immersion through direct enrollment in a host institution.

*If you are an incoming exchange student, please visit our Incoming Exchange Students page.*

If you are motivated, independent, and adaptable, an exchange program may be a good fit for you!

Some things to consider:

- Exchange students take classes mostly with local students offered in the host country's language with a different credit and grading system. Registration often takes place after arrival in your host country.
- Housing is often arranged independently with support from your host school's international student office.
- The host university application is separate from the Fordham university application, so you will complete and track two applications.

While challenging at times, exchange programs can be highly rewarding and offer some of our most culturally enriching experiences.
