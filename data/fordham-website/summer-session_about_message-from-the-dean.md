# Summer Session Message from the Dean

## Explore Summer at Fordham

**Thank you for visiting the summer program pages at Fordham University. Learn more about taking a summer class!**

Here, you will find more than 300 courses and programs in the Jesuit tradition of education that will allow you to achieve your academic goals while enjoying the vitality of the most dynamic city in the world. Enroll in classes at either of our two residential campuses, Rose Hill in the Bronx or Lincoln Center in Manhattan, or online, and learn from a prolific and energetic faculty that raves about their Fordham summer students.

We offer several special programs to help you meet some of the particular challenges you will face after graduation. Are you trying to gain professional experience?[ Fordham's Summer in the City Internship Program ](/summer-session/special-programs/new-york-city-summer-internship-seminar/)helps students to secure New York internships, receive credit, and make the most of their positions with valuable career guidance. Do you need to fulfill pre-med prerequisites? Fordham's extensive offerings in biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics allow students to stay on track for graduate or medical school.

High school students, too, can improve their college applications by taking a full-credit course in our [Pre-College Program](/summer-session/pre-college-programs/) at Fordham this summer.

When class wraps up, you are perfectly positioned to take advantage of all that NYC has to offer (for free!) each summer.

Whether you are a Fordham or visiting student, we invite you to browse our course offerings, and call or email us with questions (718-817-4665 or [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#90e3e5fdfdf5e2e3f3f8fffffcd0f6ffe2f4f8f1fdbef5f4e5)). We hope to welcome you to Fordham this summer.
