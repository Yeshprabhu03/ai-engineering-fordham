![](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/summer-session/Student-with-laptop.jpg)

In Sports Communications, the instructor will use various hands-on assignments so students can apply the communication skills they are taught in the areas of journalism, broadcasting, public relations, sports information, marketing, event planning, new media, and social media. Students will be assigned individual and group projects in these areas, ranging from marketing and public relations programs to writing stories and presenting mini-broadcasts.

Guest speakers also will address their areas of expertise in the fields of marketing/public relations, sports information, social media, journalism, broadcasting and event planning.

Each student will have an opportunity to use these developed skills throughout the week.

The course will primarily consist of lectures by the professor and by guest speakers; hands-on assignments involving journalism, broadcasting, social media, marketing and public relations.

Each student should have a strong interest in and solid foundation of knowledge regarding current and recent sports events. A heavy emphasis on reading and writing will be placed upon the students during the week of classes.

The guest speakers will provide materials from their areas of expertise, while also engaging in question-and-answer sessions with the students.

Consistent interaction with the professor, guest speakers and fellow students within the classroom environment also will be essential; class participation will play a major role in the students' abilities to learn in this class.

Skills/Learning Outcomes

- The students will leave the class with stronger written and verbal communication skills.
- The students will have learned about areas in which they likely have had little experience or opportunity.
- The students will gain immeasurable levels of self-confidence and comfort speaking to and working with groups of people.
- The students will gain a deeper understanding of how sports communicators do their jobs, and how varied those jobs are.
- The students will enhance their research, writing, editing and speaking skills as communicators.

**Overall Takeaways**

Each student will leave this class with a strong understanding and recognition of the skills that are essential for sports communicators such as journalists/broadcasters; marketing and public relations experts; and event planners. And hopefully a level of mastery of those skills on which they can build.
