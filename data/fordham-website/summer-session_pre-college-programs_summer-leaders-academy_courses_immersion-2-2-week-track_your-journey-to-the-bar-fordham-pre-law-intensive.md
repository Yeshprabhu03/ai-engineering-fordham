![](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/summer-session/Moot-Court.jpg)

The purpose of the Pre-Law Intensive is to introduce high school students to the legal profession. Students will gain a broader understanding of what being a lawyer entails; how to become a lawyer, including Law School Admissions, undergraduate coursework, LSATs, and internships; and the diverse career opportunities for lawyers. Upon completion, students should have greater self-awareness regarding their interest in pursuing a legal career or obtaining a law degree along with clear steps on how to achieve these goals. Derived particularly from Fordham’s Jesuit tradition of magis or “men and women for others,” students will achieve a holistic understanding of legal ethics and Law’s significance in shaping our society.

Skills/Learning Outcomes

Students will be able to:

- Plan an academic path from high school to college and summer internships for future law school applications.
- Identify the diverse possible career paths in Law.
- Understand the basics of reading a legal case and writing a legal document/memo.
- Engage in legal research.
- Put together an argument for a mock trial.
- Answer LSAT questions.
- Participate in a Socratic-style Law class.

Overall Takeaways

Students will benefit by learning the process of becoming a lawyer from undergraduate academic programs to graduating from Law school; working and networking with esteemed legal professionals to gain more clarity on their career path. Students will also have a better understanding of how Law functions in society.
