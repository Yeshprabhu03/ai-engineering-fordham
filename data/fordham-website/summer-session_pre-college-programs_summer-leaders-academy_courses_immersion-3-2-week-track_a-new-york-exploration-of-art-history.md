# A New York Exploration of Art History

## July 20-30, 2026 Rose Hill

![](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/summer-session/Summer__Time-Square_Cart.jpg)

This course will offer an introduction to the study of art history, approached through the lens of New York’s museums and galleries. We will analyze art works from Asia, the Americas, Africa, and Europe, to understand how and why people made and treasured paintings, sculptures, and buildings everywhere from Ancient Egypt to modern New York.

Class sessions will take place in the Met and other New York museums. Students will study major monuments of world art in person, and gain an understanding of the decisions artists made, and the periods in which they worked. In addition, this course will focus on the fundamental tools of art history as a discipline: attentive looking, clear writing, and careful research. Students will spend significant time inside and outside of class practicing these skills. As a result, participants will develop their visual literacy, while becoming completely at home in the museum environment.
