![](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/summer-session/Student-with-tablet.jpg)

This course considers how the Supreme Court works in an era of polarization and in Congress and increasing presidential power. Students will gain practice in college-style discussions, writing, and argument formation. Students will also participate in two simulations, one on the Senate confirmation process for Supreme Court justices and the second arguing a mock Supreme Court case. Class field trips are planned to the Jay Heritage Center in Rye and the 2nd District US Court of Appeals in Lower Manhattan.

### Students will:

- Learn more about how the Supreme Court works and how the

decisions it makes relate to the health of American democracy in an era of polarization. - Participate in college-style discussions, learning how to critically

and respectfully discuss different ideas with their peers. - Learn how to make effective oral arguments and how to use evidence effectively to support their viewpoint.
- Gain practice in college-style writing in the argument essay genre,

learning how to provide and respond to suggestions from their peers and instructor. - Participate in two simulations that will provide insight into how the

democratic process works, as well as giving training in effective oral communication.

Overall Takeaways

Students will gain experience using evidence to support and advance an argument, both orally and in writing. These skills will benefit students both in the application process and as beginning college students. They will also be able to respectfully discuss ideas in the law with their peers, presenting their own viewpoint while also engaging with those with differing perspectives. Finally, students will gain appreciation for how college courses approach topics in law and politics, serving as a guide when they decide which courses they might like to take in college.
