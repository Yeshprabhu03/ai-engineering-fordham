**Who can apply to the pre-college programs?**

*Students who will have completed their first year of high school by summer may apply. Non-credit classes are open to all students. Credit-bearing courses may be taken by rising seniors with a G.P.A. of 3.0 or better. *

**Does the Summer Leaders Academy offer scholarships or financial aid? **

*While there are no scholarships or financial aid, a limited number of need-based discounts are available. *

*The deadline to apply for a discount is ***April 1**.

*Students are encouraged to apply if they are eligible to receive free or reduced lunches at school and maintain a G.P.A. of 3.5 or better. Within the application, there is a section “More About You” that allows you to indicate if you would like to be considered for a discount. You may upload your proof of eligibility within the application itself or on the Status portal of your application. Acceptable proof of eligibility includes a copy of your family’s SNAP or free lunch notification (certification/re-certification) letter or a letter from a guidance counselor or administrator confirming your status.*

**Can the application fee be waived?**

*You will receive a decision approximately two weeks after you apply. Decisions will take slightly longer over a holiday.*
