# Summer Session Academic Integrity

As a Jesuit, Catholic University, Fordham is committed to ensuring that all members of the academic community strive not only for excellence in scholarship but also for the integrity of character. In the pursuit of knowledge and personal development, it is imperative that students present their own ideas and insights for evaluation, critique, and eventual reformulation. As part of this process, each student must acknowledge the intellectual contribution of others.

Instructors and students of the Summer Session will follow the standards and procedures for cases of academic integrity violation as outlined by the Fordham University Policy on [Academic Integrity](/info/25380/undergraduate_academic_integrity_policy).
