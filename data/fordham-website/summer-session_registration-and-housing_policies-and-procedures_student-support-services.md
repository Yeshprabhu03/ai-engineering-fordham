# Summer Session Student Support Services

**Support Services for Students with Disabilities:**

Fordham University treats students with disabilities in a nondiscriminatory manner and will make reasonable accommodations and provide appropriate auxiliary aids and services to assist otherwise qualified individuals with disabilities in achieving access to its programs, services and facilities in accordance with Section 504 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

Students who are seeking accommodation for a disability should contact the director of Disability Services at the following locations:

Rose Hill or Westchester Campus O’Hare Hall 718-817-4362

Lincoln Center Campus Lowenstein, Room 402 212-636-6282

**The Writing Center**

Providing more than a proofreading service, tutors will work with you on a variety of logical, rhetorical, and grammatical concerns in your writing. They can assist you with any type of writing from conception, to composition, to completion. The aim is not only to help you perfect an individual essay but to help you develop the skills you need to become a better writer. The service is free.

To sign up for a session of either one-half or one hour, go to [the writing center](/academics/academic-resources/writing-center/) and follow the instructions. If you have any questions, please call 718-817-4032 at Rose Hill or 212-636-6417 at Lincoln Center.
