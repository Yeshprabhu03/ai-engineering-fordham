# Summer Session Registration for Fordham Students

## Registration

Current Fordham students may register for summer courses through the student [registration](https://www.fordham.edu/my-pages/students/student-registration/) portal on March 2. On March 4, advising holds will be applied, and students will need to clear this hold to register for Summer or make changes to their Summer schedule.

## Policies

**Course Load: **Gabelli and PCS students can self-register for up to 12 credits. FCRH and FCLC students can self register for up to 8 credits. An FCLC or FCRH student who wants to register for more than the permitted credits will need to get approval from their [academic advisor or assistant dean](/academics/undergraduate-education/advising/fordham-college-advising/). Please email [[email protected] ](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fe989d929da19f9a88978d979099be98918c9a969f93d09b9a8b)or [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#caaca9b8a295abaebca3b9a3a4ad8aaca5b8aea2aba7e4afaebf) for further assistance.

**Pass/Fail:** *Only elective courses are eligible for Pass/Fail grading. *Please complete this [form](https://myapps.web.fordham.edu/site/web/content/hyland/pass_fail.jsp). Be sure to select the Summer term.

**Closed Classes, Waitlists, and Seat Reservations:** All undergraduate Summer courses have 10-seat waitlists. When you see the registration error message, you will have the option to select "Waitlisted" on the dropdown menu at the bottom right of the registration screen if a waitlist is available. You will be contacted at your preferred email address if a space becomes available, and you will have 48 hours to register via [my.fordham.edu](http://my.fordham.edu). Please note that once a course is filled and students are on the waitlist, if it appears that one seat is available in a course, that seat will be reserved for the next person on the waitlist. You will need to add yourself to the waitlist to secure another seat when it becomes available.

Notifications for available seats will stop **about a week before each session begins. **If a seat opens in the week before the class begins, it will be open for general registration.

Some asynchronous courses have some seats reserved for special populations. Once the non-reserved seats are filled, students must register for the waitlist. Reserved seats that have not been claimed will be released for general registration early May.

**5000-level graduate classes: **Fordham University seniors with a GPA of 3.0 or better may, with the approval of their dean and departmental advisor, register for courses offered in their major department that begin with the digit 5.

**Internships: **Fordham University students in good standing are eligible to receive credit while interning over the summer. [Learn more about internships](/summer-session/registration-and-housing/internships-and-independent-study/).

**Online Classes**

Students should be aware that, while convenient, online courses are highly-demanding and require more self-discipline than attending in-person lecture courses. Within the summer session, there are several types of online classes. Session III courses meet online for ten weeks and the coursework is entirely asynchronous. Although Session III classes are asynchronous, meaning that you can work on them when you choose, there are due dates for assignments, and it is easy to fall behind.

Session I and II five-week classes require synchronous class meetings. Please see the meeting days in the course descriptions.

Syllabi are posted with the course descriptions where possible. Please do not register for an online course if you anticipate any possibility of disruption to your accessibility to Blackboard for the duration of the class. Being unable to log into the course after the add-drop period will not be considered grounds for exceptions to the refund schedule.

**Asynchronous Online Courses: **These types of course offerings do not take place in real–time. Students are provided with content and assignments and are given a time frame to complete course work and exams. Interaction usually takes place through discussion boards, blogs and wikis. As a result, there is no class meeting time. Asynchronous online learning environments are effective for students with time constraints or busy schedules.

**Synchronous Online Courses: **These types of course offerings require the instructor and all enrolled students to interact online simultaneously. Similar in some ways to a webinar, participants interact through text, video or audio chat. Synchronous learning environments enable students to participate in a course from a distance in real time.

**Hybrid Courses: **Hybrid courses, also known as blended courses, are learning environments that allow for both in–person and online interaction. Typically, hybrid courses meet in person several times during a semester and provide for computer–based communication in between those face to face sessions.

## Instructions

- On the Student tab of my.fordham.edu, select "Look Up Classes and Student Registration" in the Student Registration channel. Select the Summer term.
- Select the "Advanced Search" option.
- In the "College" field, you may select Summer Session I, Summer Session II, and/or Summer Session III to begin your search. Note that asynchronous courses are only available in Session III.
- After completing the college field, you may browse by Subject and/or Course Attribute.
- Interpreting your results:

- Session: if you elect to search on multiple sessions at once in the college field, you can look at the first number in the section to identify the term quickly. R11, L11, V11, R12, L12, V12 are all session I courses (May 27 - June 26). R21, L21, V21, R22, L22, V22 are all session II courses (July 1 - August 5). Session III courses mostly have the section of PW1 (May 27 - August 5).
- Campus: Virtual means the class meets only online. RH and LC classes meet on campus and online attendance is not possible except in the case of SOCI 4900.
- 5000+: courses with a number of 5000 and above are graduate classes. You can avoid these by selecting Undergraduate in the "Level" field.
