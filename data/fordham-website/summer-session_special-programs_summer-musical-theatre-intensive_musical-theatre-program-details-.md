## Improvisation Excercise

A musical theatre improvisation exercise from the last day when students were asked to use the prompt text: "What I learned this summer at Fordham." In 10 minutes, they came up with this exhilarating vocal and physical share. The exercise required everyone to have a solo, harmony, choreography, and a chorus sung between the solos. Accompanist: Mana Allen and David Wolfson
