**COMC-1101-L21- Communications & Culture: History, Theory, and Methods***Summer Session 2: June 30, 2026 - August 04, 2026YL - Hybrid LC/Online: TWR, 01:00PM - 04:00PM*

An introduction to the history, theory and methods of Communication Studies, Media Studies, and Cultural Studies. This serves as the required introductory course for the major in Communication and Culture. It provides students with a basic theoretical foundation for understanding the interdisciplinary traditions of our field, an historical examination of key paradigms and theorists, and an overview of the methodological approaches used by scholars of mediated communication. We will explore the ways in which theory and methodology are inextricably intertwined and how their relationship shapes both inquiry and analysis. Four-credit courses that meet for 150 minutes per week require three additional hours of class preparation per week on the part of the student in lieu of an additional hour of formal instruction

By all accounts, we have witnessed an explosion of LGBTQ representation in the media over the last decade. This course critically examines the terms of this new visibility, and inquires into the exclusions that accompany the recognition of certain queer and trans subjects. Through the study of media, film and popular culture, we will explore how representations of sex and sexuality are also central to the construction of ideas about race, class, gender, and nation.

**COMC-4380-L11- Media and Moral Philosophy***Summer Session 1: May 26, 2026 - June 25, 2026YL - Hybrid LC/Online: TR, 09:00AM - 12:00PM*

This senior values EP4 seminar examines public discourse through the lens of moral philosophy. Debate in the public sphere often uses moral narratives to make sense of difficult issues or events. When something grips the national attention—such as a school shooting, a hotly contested election, or an environmental disaster—we don’t just need to know what happened, we also need to grapple with why. We want to understand whether and how this changes who we are as a society and our place in history. To this end, news and social media create diverse and often contradictory narratives about who is blameworthy and who is a victim, about what moral goods are at stake and the best way to protect and promote them. Understanding these narratives in moral terms is crucial to becoming an ethically informed public citizen, because it helps us grasp the deeply human stakes underlying what may often seem like endless newsfeed chatter. Each iteration of the course focuses on a different issue. In this version of the course, we will be looking at the moral narratives around gender. Note:

**COMM-3701-V31- Summer Internship Seminar***Summer Session 3: May 26, 2026 - Aug 4, 2026V - Virtual (online courses only): Asynchronous*

In this course we explore the development of a life’s work in the context of broader issues in the contemporary media workplace, broadly defined. Through asynchronous discussion, exercises, readings, and reflections, we will examine students’ own experiences in contemporaneous internships, exploring subjects including finding meaning in your work, diversity in the workplace, connecting with mentors and role models, identifying your workplace values, and more. As much as possible, this course will cater to the particular needs and professional ideals of the students enrolled.

**DTEM-1402-R11- Digital Cultures***Summer Session 1: May 26, 2026 - June 25, 2026YR - Hybrid RH/Online: TR, 09:00AM - 12:00PM*

This course will examine the interplay between digital environments and the culture(s) they both stem from and shape. It will give special attention to the ways digital and networked spaces relate to lived experiences on- and offline, organize social relationships, shape values and norms, engage individuals in participatory modes of cultural production, and impact culture on an individual, group, and trans-national scale. Students will investigate the culture(s) (social norms, language, practices of inclusion and exclusion, etc.) of individual digital platforms and learn about cultural norms that span the digital world more broadly. We will also critically engage with whether and how those qualities might also impact the offline experience of various communities or groups, such as those based on race, gender, class, abilities, or affiliation with various subcultures or values.

This course provides an overview of and hands-on approach to contemporary digital research methods, including ethnography, interviews, focus groups, metrics and analytics, and polling and surveys.

**DTEM-3500-V21- Resistance and Global Activism***Summer Session 2: June 30, 2026 - August 04, 2026V - Virtual (online courses only): TWR, 09:00AM - 12:00PM*

This course studies the proliferation, and implications, of digital technology in political resistance. The goal is to provide students with analytical tools and skills for understanding the strengths and weaknesses of contemporary digital resistance. The course’s perspective is on the resistance played out in the “everyday life” of “ordinary” people: a resistance that might be widespread and diffused, individual or small scale, implicitly political, disguised, or even hidden. It brings to light how the “private” or “personal” can be political and explores the creativity of “cultural resistance.” Particular interest will be paid to studying new sources of power and their ability to subvert or censor acts of digital resistance. By taking this course, the participants will gain a sophisticated understanding of the role played by technology, and technology providers, in the performance of and resistance to power. Course participants will develop a critical understanding of the nature of technology and its implications for local, regional, and global justice. Note:

**PMMA-5001-V21- Public Media Theory & Practice***SG2 - GAS Summer Session 2 JUN 30, 2026 - AUG 04, 2026V - Virtual (online courses only): MW, 06:00PM - 09:00PM*

Serving as a core introductory course for the Public Media MA program, this class examines central topics in the study and practice of media in the public interest. Students consider what is the role of media and communication in promoting (or constraining) positive social change, and what unique roles do journalists and strategic communication professionals play throughout this process? What do we mean, exactly, by concepts such as public media, the public interest, social justice, and civic engagement? How do historical and contemporary power dynamics, information technologies, and economic structures shape the types of stories that dominate the public sphere, and how do resistant voices find ways to disrupt those narratives over time? Course readings and multimedia materials are drawn from a wide variety of academic disciplines and professional sectors, while course assignments ask students to grapple with real-world topics, aiming to not only analyze social problems but also identify potential solutions.
