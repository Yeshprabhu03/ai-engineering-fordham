Game theory considers static and dynamic situations of strategic interaction among entities such as individuals, firms, governments, and teams.

The approach applies the "rational choice" framework used in economics to analyze the purpose, effect, and genesis of laws. Attention is paid to the effect of legal structures on economic efficiency. Economic analysis of law is one of the fastest-growing and most influential areas of both economic and legal scholarship. This course is of value to both the general economist and students planning to attend law school.

Films spirit us away. Whether we journey somewhere in time or far, far away, we do it in the name of entertainment. One does not simply walk away from a well-made film unchanged. Regardless of the subject, genre, or direction, film draws from the human experience. This course will utilize film to illustrate the concepts that students have and will encounter in their study of economics. Through the lens of economic analysis, students will experience film and enrich the film-going experience.

**ECON-3971-V31- Urban Economics***Summer Session 3: May 26, 2026 - Aug 4, 2026V - Virtual (online courses only): Asynchronous*

Urban Economics is the study of location choices by firms and households.

Throughout the course, New York City's history and current situation are used as examples of the economic forces operating in cities. Students will participate in a group project to analyze a major urban problem such as housing affordability, poverty, crime, or education. Note:

This course is intended primarily for IPED students interested in analyzing the dynamics of emerging financial markets in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. It compliments POGA 6991- Political Risk Analysis. Students must prepare a study of one country's basic macroeconomic performance, foreign exchange market, and stock market. The use of a computer and the internet are incorporated into the course to gather data and analyze it statistically. Intended primarily for IPED students, this course explores the dynamics of emerging financial markets in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America. Complementing and expanding upon the skills learned in POGA 6991 Political Risk Analysis, students learn how to prepare a country study regarding their country's leading macroeconomic indicators, the stability of its foreign exchange market, and the likely returns and risks associated with its stock market. Real-time data is obtained from the university's Bloomberg Terminal and the internet. Additional data is available from standard written and CD-ROM statistical sources. Students are taught how to analyze this data using standard statistical software to forecast trends as well as to estimate returns, volatility, and cross-correlations. An optimal portfolio of equity investments in emerging markets is estimated. Students also analyze the dynamics of emerging financial markets in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America.
