With the exponential growth of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, the forensic examination and security of these objects has garnered increased attention. Moreover, digital forensic examiners have been presented with a unique set of challenges in order to understand how such devices secure, store and process data. This course is structured utilizing modules which will provide students with extensive hands experience in an interactive lab environment that will delve into the issues in IoT forensics and security. Through experimental testing participants will investigate and review the security of home IoT devices. The testing will include: traffic capture, device scanning and the analysis of wireless signals. In addition, a review and analysis of privacy exposure will be conducted, outlining the security vectors and malware used to attack and control IoT devices. Subsequent modules will be comprised of explanation, theory and numerous hands on exercises, culminating in discussion regarding the IoT technology stack and how it impacts digital forensics. Through use of existing digital forensic tools and methodology, we will introduce students to the application of digital forensics in the IoT framework by examining ordinary home devices. Examinations will provide students with hands on experience into a hunt for artifacts, identifying formats of stored data, encoding methods, while documenting their efforts throughout the process. Respective analysis of collection techniques, device workflow and the object data repositories will provide participants with an understanding of the full forensic value of these devices.

Students consider what is the role of media and communication in promoting (or constraining) positive social change, and what unique roles do journalists and strategic communication professionals play throughout this process? What do we mean, exactly, by concepts such as public media, the public interest, social justice, and civic engagement? How do historical and contemporary power dynamics, information technologies, and economic structures shape the types of stories that dominate the public sphere, and how do resistant voices find ways to disrupt those narratives over time? Course readings and multimedia materials are drawn from a wide variety of academic disciplines and professional sectors, while course assignments ask students to grapple with real-world topics, aiming to not only analyze social problems but also identify potential solutions.

Natural knowledge and the manipulation of nature have often been gendered, but how, why, and by whom? This seminar will explore the multitude of ways that women have shaped and been shaped by these gendered visions of nature and the tools for controlling it. What forms of natural knowledge were deemed appropriate for women? Why were women understood to be particularly adept at specific technologies or handicrafts? How were spaces for scientific practice or technological production rendered hospitable or, more often, inhospitable for women? In what ways have systems of scientific authority limited or encouraged the participation of female researchers? How have science and technology been used to act on women's bodies? Are there specifically "womanly" ways of knowing? These and other questions will be explored through cases across a wide range of periods, disciplines, and geographies, allowing us not only to question the shifting place of women within the worlds of science and technology but also to question our assumptions about the place of science and technology within different societies. Note: Four-credit courses that meet for 150 minutes per week require three additional hours of class preparation per week on the part of the student in lieu of an additional hour of formal instruction.

In this course, students will develop a theoretical understanding and practical experience selecting and administering specialized forensic assessment instruments. The course will be roughly equally divided between understanding the theoretical underpinnings and psycho-legal utility of forensic assessment instruments as well as practical issues in their administration, scoring, and interpretation. The types of forensic assessment instruments covered include tests of malingering and deception, risk assessment tools and techniques, sex offender and psychopathy assessment, and personality assessment in the context of forensic evaluations. In addition, more specialized instruments, such as those designed to assess competence to stand trial, will be reviewed.
