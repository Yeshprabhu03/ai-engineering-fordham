**ECON-3971-V31- Urban Economics***Summer Session 3, May 26, 2026 - August 4, 2026Online: Asynchronous*

Urban Economics is the study of location choices by firms and households. The technological changes and economic factors driving the process of urbanization, and the shift from a "downtown-centered" city to the suburbanized metropolises prevalent in the U.S. today are the central focus of the course. Throughout the course, New York City's history and current situation are used as examples of the economic forces operating in cities. Students will participate in a group project to analyze a major urban problem such as housing affordability, poverty, crime, or education.

**HIST-4591-V11- Race, Sex, and Colonialism***Summer Session 1: May 26, 2026 - June 25, 2026V - Virtual (online courses only): MTWR, 01:00PM - 04:00PM*

In this Senior Values seminar, we will explore how race, sex, and gender were constructed, regulated, and contested in colonial contexts, highlighting both similarities and differences across these colonial experiences. The course will focus on one or more of the following regions during their colonial periods: Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Close attention will be paid to the methodological approaches our authors take and to the theoretical insights we can draw from our diverse case studies to help us better discern the common and singular threads running through this expansive field of inquiry. Case studies will be accompanied by foundational theoretical readings on race, colonialism, and sexuality. Weekly class presentations and revision writing will be a fundamental part of achieving eloquence in speaking and writing during the course of the semester. Note:
