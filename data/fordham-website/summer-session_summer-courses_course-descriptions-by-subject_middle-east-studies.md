**ARAB-2200-V11- Quranic Arabic Grammar***Summer Session 1: May 26, 2026 - June 25, 2026V - Virtual (online courses only): TWR, 09:00AM - 12:00PM*

The Quran is the source of inspiration for Islam, one of the world’s major religions, which is practiced today by more than 1 billion people. Muslims hold the Quran to be the Word of God revealed to the Prophet Muhammad. Ever since it appeared 1,400 years ago, it has generated volumes of commentary. The Quran is the first book written in Arabic. It is responsible for establishing Arabic as a written language and for isolating it from external impetus to change. In this class, we will examine how the Quran established an unchanging norm for the Arabic language. We will study the grammar of classicized Quranic Arabic. All examples and reading will be taken from the text of the Quran and the body of the Hadith, Muhammed’s commentary on the Quran. We will supplement our exploration of the Quran with extracts from other classical sources. This course is ideally suited for students who are interested in Islamic theology and/or the Arabic language. Students will complete this course with a more profound understanding of the intimate relationship between the Quran and the Arabic language.
