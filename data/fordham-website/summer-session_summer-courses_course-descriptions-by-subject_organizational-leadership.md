**ORGL-2210-PW1- Ethical Decision Making - Lead***Summer Session 3: May 26, 2026 - Aug 4, 2026V - Virtual (online courses only): Asynchronous*

Focuses on basic ethical viewpoints as a foundation and examines specific characteristics of business life through cases and examples. The fact that there is not one universal set of behaviors one considers ethical and no guidelines to follow to determine ethical behavior poses unique challenges to contemporary leaders. Yet, leaders are faced with situations where individual values may conflict with those of teams or organizations. Topics include professional responsibility and loyalty, conflict of interest, and employee rights, personal integrity and critical thinking in decision making.
