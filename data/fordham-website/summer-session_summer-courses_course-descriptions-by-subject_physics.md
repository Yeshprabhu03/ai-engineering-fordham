**PHYS-1350-V11- The Physics of Climate Change***Summer Session 1: May 26, 2026 - June 25, 2026V - Virtual (online courses only): TWR, 09:00AM - 12:00PM*

Anthropogenic climate change due to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning is having a profound effect on the global community. The consequences range from mild to catastrophic. This course will provide an overview of the physics behind climate change, including how scientists know human activities are responsible for global warming, sea level rise, and ocean acidification.
