Psychologists who work in legal settings are often confronted with questions and diagnostic dilemmas that rarely arise in traditional clinical settings. As a result, a number of specialized assessment techniques have been developed over the past few decades, many of which are designed to address specific psycho-legal issues. In this course, students will develop a theoretical understanding and practical experience selecting and administering specialized forensic assessment instruments. The course will be roughly equally divided between understanding the theoretical underpinnings and psycho-legal utility of forensic assessment instruments as well as practical issues in their administration, scoring, and interpretation. The types of forensic assessment instruments covered include tests of malingering and deception, risk assessment tools and techniques, sex offender and psychopathy assessment, and personality assessment in the context of forensic evaluations. In addition, more specialized instruments, such as those designed to assess competence to stand trial, will be reviewed.
