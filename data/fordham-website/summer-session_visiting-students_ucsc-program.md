We will trace first the economic and human consequences of this newly global system, for Europeans and non-Europeans alike, and we will then explore questions proper to each discipline at the time, the changes they underwent, as the ways that new interactions and discoveries shocked and exploded ancient traditions and authority, and how the approaches of the period compare to contemporary methods in each area.
