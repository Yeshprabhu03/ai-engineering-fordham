# Class Visits

## What's it like inside a Fordham classroom?

Admitted students can register to attend a real Fordham class alongside current Fordham students and taught by a member of our faculty. Class visits can give you an introduction to Fordham's academic life and preview the exciting opportunities and rigor of a Jesuit education.

We have selected a representative sample of courses from each of our undergraduate colleges, at times that fit within our regular campus visit program.

Class visits are for the registered admitted students only. Parents, other guests, and other prospective students are welcome instead to [take a tour or attend an information session](http://admission.fordham.edu/event-calendar).

After you make your class reservation, you will receive a confirmation email with important arrival instructions.

## We can help.

Should you need any assistance with planning a class visit at Fordham, please email our class visit coordinator Laynie Hirsch, [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#701c021f1212191e034930161f021418111d5e151405).

## Here's what else you should know.

**How long do classes typically last?**

Classes are typically one hour and 15 minutes, but can be up two hours and 45 minutes. Please be sure to check the start and end time of the class for which are registering. Students are expected to attend the class for the full time period.**Can I register for more than one class?**

We hope that as many admitted students as possible will have a chance to visit a class, so class visits are limited to one class per admitted student.**What if I can no longer attend a class visit that I registered for?**

It’s important that you cancel your registration if you can no longer attend the class visit. This allows us notify the professor beforehand and opens up your spot for other interested students. To cancel your registration, please go to your registration confirmation email. This email includes a link to cancel.**Can my parent(s) or other guest attend the class with me?**

Class visits are for the registered admitted students only. Parents, other guests, and other prospective students are welcome instead to [take a tour or attend an information session](http://admission.fordham.edu/event-calendar). Register them under your name, as if you were going on the tour. This way, you'll get arrival instructions.**I don’t see a class in my intended major. **

Given the wide variety of majors and minors at Fordham, we cannot offer class visits in all departments. Given the breadth of Fordham’s [Core Curriculum](https://www.fordham.edu/info/21516/core_curriculum), attending a class outside your intended major will still provide a preview of your future academic experience. You can learn more about a particular [major or minor](/undergraduate-admission/majors-and-minors/) right now and get departmental contacts if you have specific questions.
