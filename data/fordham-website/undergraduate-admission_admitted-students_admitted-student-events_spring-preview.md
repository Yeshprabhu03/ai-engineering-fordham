## Why Spring Preview?

Spring Preview is our most elaborate admitted student event on campus! You'll hear from faculty, staff, and current students, as well as our president, Tania Tetlow, who is excited to share her love of Fordham with you. We recommend you make travel plans to come early and stay late so you don't miss anything.


You'll have options throughout the day and be able to build a Spring Preview that gives you all the answers you need to decide if Fordham is the place for you.


We can’t wait to welcome you!

### Can't make Spring Preview? Come for another admitted student event.

If you can’t attend Spring Preview weekend, we’ve got weekday Admitted Student Days and weekend Admitted Student Presentations! There are other visit options almost every weekday in late March and throughout April.
