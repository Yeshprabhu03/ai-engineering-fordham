# Visa Information for Admitted International Students

### Currently Residing Outside the U.S.

International students currently residing outside the United States will need to apply for an F-1 student visa at the nearest U.S. consulate to attend Fordham and study in the United States full time. Fordham will issue an I-20 document (Certificate of Eligibility) for use in your F-1 student visa application. To issue you a Fordham I-20*, we require:

- A completed
[Application for Certificate of Eligibility (AFCOE)](https://www.fordham.edu/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/international-services/pdfs/AFCOE-2025-2026.pdf) - Documents verifying you have adequate financial resources to meet the tuition, fees and living expenses of your full time program (bank statement, bank letter, scholarship award, etc.)
- A copy of the data page of your current passport

Please upload these documents through your [Fordham applicant portal](https://admission.fordham.edu/account/login?r=https%3a%2f%2fadmission.fordham.edu%2fapply%2fstatus).

### Currently Residing in the U.S. with F-1 Student Visa

International students currently residing in the United States who already have an F-1 student visa must arrange to have their SEVIS record transferred from their current school to Fordham. This allows Fordham to issue you a new I-20 document. To issue you a Fordham I-20*, we require:

- A completed
[Application for Certificate of Eligibility (AFCOE)](https://www.fordham.edu/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/international-services/pdfs/AFCOE-2025-2026.pdf) - Documents verifying you have adequate financial resources to meet the tuition, fees and living expenses of your full-time program (bank statement, bank letter, scholarship award, etc.)
- A copy of the data page of your current passport
- A completed
[Transfer Form](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/pdfs/jadu-single-folder-pdfs/ESL_F_1_Transfer_Recommendation_Form.pdf)with the SEVIS transfer date specified

Please upload these documents through your [Fordham applicant portal](https://admission.fordham.edu/account/login?r=https%3a%2f%2fadmission.fordham.edu%2fapply%2fstatus).

Once these documents have been received and your current school has released your SEVIS record to Fordham, we can issue you a Fordham I-20. Please check the validity of your F-1 student visa, as you may need to use your Fordham I-20 to apply for a new F-1 student visa prior to beginning study at Fordham.

### Currently Residing in the U.S. with Other Visa

International students currently residing in the United States who hold another type of non-immigrant visa can also apply for an F-1 student visa prior to beginning study at Fordham if they wish. This is not always necessary, depending on your current visa status. If you have any questions about this issue or your specific situation, please contact [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c2abacb6a3a6afabb1b1abadac82a4adb0a6aaa3afeca7a6b7).

We advise that you resolve all visa-related issues as soon as possible and make visa appointments as soon as you receive your I-20*.

***Your I-20 will be sent to your Fordham email.**
