# Testing Policy

## Fordham’s Test-Optional Policy

The Office of Undergraduate Admission does not require scores from the SAT or ACT. Since moving to test-optional in May 2020, Fordham has enrolled the largest, most diverse classes in the University's history, while maintaining our high academic standards. With this in mind, Fordham will retain its test-optional policy. Fordham’s Office of Undergraduate Admission has always employed a holistic admission process. If you choose to submit a test score, it will be only one among many factors in our academic evaluation of your application. *Applicants who choose not to submit test scores will not be penalized for making this choice.***How Do I Indicate My Test-Optional Choice?**

On the Common Application, you’ll be able to indicate whether or not you want Fordham to consider your scores as a part of the application review. Applications from students who opt not to have test scores included in the review will be considered complete without testing. Applications from students who opt to have test scores included in the review will be considered incomplete until testing is submitted.**Changes to Testing Status**

To receive a timely decision, you must make changes to your testing status or submit self-reported scores using the forms in your [applicant portal](http://admission.fordham.edu/status) **no later than November 20 (Early Action, Early Decision I) or January 20 (Regular Decision, Early Decision II).****Deciding Whether or Not to Submit Scores**

We will not penalize any student for their choice to submit or not submit standardized test scores. That said, please keep in mind that should you indicate on your Common Application that you would like your test scores included in the review of your application, we will view those scores within the context of the SAT/ACT middle 50% range metric of our most recent class profile. If you're wondering whether submitting test scores is the right choice for you, we recommend reviewing our [class profile](https://www.fordham.edu/undergraduate-admission/why-fordham/admission-facts/). We also encourage you to consider if submitting test scores will give our admission team a greater view of your strengths as an applicant. In this past year of test-optional admission, approximately 65% of applicants who gained admission did not submit testing

**Optional Test Sections**

As with the decision to submit testing in general, whether or not to submit optional sections (such as SAT Writing, ACT Science, or ACT Writing) is up to the student. You will not be penalized if you submit test scores without an optional section.

**Superscoring Tests**

Should a student take more than one administration of the same type of test, Fordham will superscore those results.**As of September 2025, the ACT will roll out a new composite score composed of the English, Reading and Math sections. We will superscore sections between tests taken prior to September 2025 and after September 2025.***Merit Scholarship and Honors Program Consideration**

We do not require applicants to submit test scores to be considered for merit scholarships or honors programs.**Self-Reported Scores**

We accept self-reported scores for admission consideration. You may **only** self-report scores using the form in your [applicant portal](http://admission.fordham.edu/status).**Will I need to submit official scores at any point?**

If you elected to have your application reviewed with standardized test scores (ACT or SAT) and submitted self-reported test scores to Fordham for this purpose, you must have your official test scores submitted within three weeks of submitting your enrollment deposit. Your enrollment at Fordham is contingent upon the submission of your official scores. To submit official scores, you may either order a score report directly from the testing agency (fee required) or ask your school counselor to send us a copy of your score report that they certify as official to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#99fcf7ebf6f5f5d9fff6ebfdf1f8f4b7fcfdec).

If submitting official test scores, please use the following Fordham codes:

- SAT: 2259
- ACT: 2748

**PAA Exam for Applicants from Puerto Rico**

While Fordham does not require any standardized testing (SAT or ACT) for admission or scholarship consideration, you are welcome to submit your [PAA score](https://latam.collegeboard.org/paa/) report as an optional supplemental material. It is not a requirement, but we will recognize it as a part of our admission committee review if you choose to submit it. If you do not plan on submitting SAT or ACT scores, but you do wish to submit the PAA as an optional supplemental material, please note that you will still be considered a Test Optional applicant. When submitting the Common Application, you must indicate that you will not be submitting testing, as that question only refers to SAT or ACT score submission. To submit your PAA score for review, please email the PDF of your PAA score report to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#31545f435e5d5d71575e435559505c1f545544). If you have any questions, please [contact your admission counselor](https://admission.fordham.edu/register/admissioncounselors). **English Language Proficiency**

International students whose first language is not English must demonstrate their proficiency through English Language Proficiency test results:
