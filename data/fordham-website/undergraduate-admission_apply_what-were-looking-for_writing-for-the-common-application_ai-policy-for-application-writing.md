# AI Policy for Application Writing

As a Jesuit University, we believe that your unique gifts—your intelligence, creativity, and ethical compass—are what make you fully human. The rise in artificial intelligence tools (e.g. ChatGPT) creates the ability to use shortcuts that may seem attractive, but won’t yield the same result as reflection, revision, and original thought.

**Your application writing is our best way to get to know you**—**the***real***you.**At Fordham, we have an applicant pool of over 44,000 students. As such, we are unfortunately unable to offer interviews as a standard part of our application process. This means that we rely on the writing you present in your application to learn more about who you are on a deeper level, beyond your transcripts and activities. AI can’t capture how you think or what you value.**You can use AI as a tool—but proceed with caution.**Your best sounding boards are the people in your life who know you well—family, friends, counselors, teachers, etc. They are the people who can tell you if your writing sounds authentic to you. Using AI in its proper place, such as brainstorming ideas or polishing a draft, ensures that your work remains original.**Your application is a promise that who you present to us is who will show up on our campuses.**In turn, we promise that we will review your application holistically. This means that each part is looked at in relation to the whole, not in isolation. We consider each element of the application in its appropriate context. If pieces of your application are manufactured or not genuine, you won’t create a cohesive narrative. Your application is the story of*you*and should reflect your genuine abilities. We expect all Fordham students to adhere to the highest level of academic integrity.

We know that embarking on this process can seem daunting, but if you embrace the opportunity to truly reflect on your journey, you’ll create writing that you’re truly proud of—and learn more about yourself in the process.
