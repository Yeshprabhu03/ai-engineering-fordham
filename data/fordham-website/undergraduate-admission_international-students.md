# International Students

**Central Location and Endless Opportunities**

New York City provides the perfect environment for students to grow in academic excellence and ethical awareness, two hallmarks of a Jesuit education at Fordham. Moreover, New York City is a perfect fit for international students. The City is the crossroads of American business, culture, and entertainment yet is influenced by communities of people from around the world; you will feel at home, no matter how far you have traveled to get here. [You are welcome here!](https://vimeo.com/226018228)

**Test-Optional Admission**

Fordham University does not require SAT or ACT results from any first-year and [transfer applicants](/undergraduate-admission/international-students/international-transfer-students/) applying from outside the United States and its territories, without regard to citizenship or secondary school curriculum. Those students wishing to share their standardized test results to be considered in our [holistic review](/undergraduate-admission/apply/what-were-looking-for/) may self-report* their scores via the Common Application.**Only admitted students who elected to send in standardized test results and choose to enroll at Fordham will be required to have their official scores sent by the testing agency.*

**Need-Based Aid**

In addition to automatic consideration for [merit scholarships](/student-financial-services/types-of-financial-aid/international-student-scholarships/), **new first-year applicants** who will study at Fordham on a non-immigrant visa may be eligible for partial need-based financial aid. To be considered in this need-aware application review process, students must demonstrate an ability to fund at least $35,000 USD per year. More information is provided below and on our [FAQ page](/undergraduate-admission/international-students/international-faqs/).

Fordham University offers need-based aid awards to a limited number of first-year international students who apply for the

**fall semester**. Spring and transfer international applicants are not eligible for need-based financial aid. Selection for awards will be based on academic and extracurricular achievement as well as a thoughtful assessment of demonstrated need. The application requirements for all first-year fall semester applicants to Fordham who plan to attend on a non-immigrant visa will include submission of either the Fordham Statement of Funding or the CSS Profile (see Application Requirements above for details).The Fordham application review for non-immigrant international applicants is a need aware process. Due to limited funding, not all who require aid will receive awards and the amount of required aid may impact the final admission decision.

As funding for international students is limited, need-based aid awards will not cover the complete annual cost of attendance. The annual awards may range from a few thousand dollars up to the cost of a student’s first-year

**full tuition charges at maximum.**As the student and family will be responsible for all annual indirect charges, to qualify, the CSS Profile Estimated Family Contribution (EFC) must demonstrate a minimum of $35,000. This figure includes estimates for room and board, textbooks, travel expenses, health insurance, and miscellaneous expenses. Though you may pursue your application to Fordham with a lower EFC, please understand that the largest awards available do not reach the full cost of attendance.Only electronic submission of the official CSS Profile via the

[College Board](https://cssprofile.collegeboard.org/)is accepted for international student need-based financial aid consideration. You must use the same email for the CSS Profile as you did for the Common Application. The ISFAA or PDF copies of a CSS Profile can not be considered. In order to complete the process of seeking financial aid, please fill out the CB FinAid ID form sent to your email by the CSS Profile deadline. As Fordham does not commit to meeting full demonstrated need,**CSS Profile fee waivers are not offered.**Need-based aid awards are offered at the same amount annually for up to four years provided the student meets minimum GPA and Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements. Any international need-based aid recipient who receives a green card or US citizenship during enrollment at Fordham will maintain a Fordham Tuition Award of equal value to their initial award for up to four years total.



It is important to note that award totals will not be adjusted in subsequent years so students and families must plan their finances accordingly, expecting estimated annual cost of attendance increases of 3-5%.

In addition,[Fordham will continue to offer partial merit scholarships](/student-financial-services/types-of-financial-aid/international-student-scholarships/)up to $25,000 to international applicants who qualify for these competitive academic awards.
