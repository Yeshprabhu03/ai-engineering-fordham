## General Information

**Students who have successfully completed the equivalent of a United States secondary school education and who have enrolled in any university-level coursework at another institution either in the United States or abroad must apply for transfer admission.**

Those who have received the equivalent of a United States bachelor's degree and are seeking a second degree (even if in a very different field of study) are recommended to apply to a Fordham University [graduate degree program](/information-for/international-students/graduate-admission/) or in some cases to our undergraduate [School of Professional and Continuing Studies](/school-of-professional-and-continuing-studies/). Second degree seekers should generally not apply to the traditional undergraduate colleges at Fordham University.

**Second Degree Seekers**Students who have successfully completed the equivalent of a United States secondary school education and who have enrolled in any university-level coursework at another institution either in the United States or abroad must apply for transfer admission.

Those who have received the equivalent of a United States bachelor's degree and are seeking a second degree (even if in a very different field of study) are recommended to apply to a Fordham University

[graduate degree program](/information-for/international-students/graduate-admission/)or in some cases to our undergraduate[School of Professional and Continuing Studies](/school-of-professional-and-continuing-studies/). Second degree seekers should generally not apply to the traditional undergraduate colleges at Fordham University.**Post-Secondary Students**Any applicant who graduated from high school or received a high school equivalency diploma, who completed or will complete coursework at a 2 or 4 year regionally accredited college or university at the time of application, and who intends to enroll full-time (15 credit hours per semester) in one of Fordham’s three undergraduate colleges to pursue a bachelor's degree qualifies as a transfer applicant. A student must meet all of these criteria to be considered a transfer applicant.

Any student who earns college credit after completing a secondary school diploma is considered a transfer student, regardless of the number of credits completed. Both matriculated and non-matriculated students who earn credit will be considered a transfer. If you have audited a class or completed noncredit coursework, then you may be considered an incoming first-year student. Typically, students who complete language intensive classes, who do not earn credit, are considered an incoming first-year student.

Students who begin their studies at a college or university and withdraw prior to earning credit must contact the Office of Admission via email at

[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cea7a0baafaaa3a7bdbda7a1a08ea8a1bcaaa6afa3e0abaabb)to confirm their status. In order to be considered as a first-year, a student must withdraw prior to the add/drop date at the institution they attended and provide official documentation (college transcript, withdrawal form) indicating the date of their withdrawal. In addition, to be considered a first year, the student must not have had any financial aid disbursed from the federal government while at the college or university that he or she attended.The Office of Admission will exercise professional judgment and consider each student’s circumstances to ensure that, regardless of status (first year or transfer), the best interest of the student’s needs are met related to enrollment.
