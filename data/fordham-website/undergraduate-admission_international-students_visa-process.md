# Visa Process

Fordham can assist admitted students in applying for an F-1 student visa at a United States Embassy or Consulate outside of the United States of America.

## To apply for an F-1 student visa, you must have:

- an acceptance letter from Fordham University
- a Fordham I-20 document

## To obtain a I-20 document, you must provide:

- a completed
[Application for Certificate of Eligibility (AFCOE)](https://www.fordham.edu/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/international-services/pdfs/AFCOE-2025-2026.pdf) - a supporting bank statement demonstrating proof of funding for at least one year of full-time study at Fordham University
- a copy of the information page of your passport

Please upload these documents through your applicant portal.

### International Students Currently in the United States

Students in the United States currently in F-1 visa status also need to submit a [transfer form](https://www.fordham.edu/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/international-services/pdfs/Transfer-Form-updated-Nov-2023.pdf) completed by your current designated school official (DSO) in order to transfer your SEVIS record to Fordham University.

Students in the United States in a different (non-student) visa status, may be able to maintain their current status while pursuing full-time study at Fordham or may be able to obtain an F-1 student visa.
