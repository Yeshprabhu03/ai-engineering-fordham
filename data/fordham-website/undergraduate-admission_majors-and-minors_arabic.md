Study one of the fastest-growing languages in the world and the cultures that utilize it.

With Fordham’s minor in Arabic, you’ll study the Arabic language and culture structurally and functionally. Arabic speakers are in high demand globally, with the language playing an important role in international diplomacy, business, and intelligence.

Our curriculum reflects the Standards for Foreign Language Learning in the 21st Century, which describes the five C's of language acquisition: communication, culture, comparisons, connections, and community. With the Arabic minor, you’ll have the opportunity to practice the three modes of communication (interpersonal, interpretive, and presentational), to learn about Arabic culture (products, practices, and perspectives), and to make comparisons between your first language and culture and the Arabic language and culture.

Of course, you’ll learn more than Arabic here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, history, mathematics, languages, and the arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education. We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.
