# Asian American Studies

Degree Options: Minor Only

Locations: Lincoln Center, Rose Hill[Visit the Asian American studies department.](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/departments/asian-american-studies/)

Study the history, literature, and culture of one of the fastest growing racial and ethnic groups in the United States.

With the U.S. Asian American population projected to more than double by 2060, there has never been a more crucial time to explore Asian American studies.

The Asian American studies minor is an interdisciplinary course of study that seeks to engage you in critical themes related to Asian and Asian Americans, including race, gender, sexuality, capital, and empire. The minor aims to help you understand major historical events that have shaped Asian racialization in western society and how to analyze their relevance to the present day. At a time when discrimination against Asian Americans has been on the rise, you’ll learn how to communicate your knowledge effectively to help empower Asian American and Asian diasporic communities, build meaningful coalitions, and promote the cause of social justice.

In addition to lessons in the classroom, you’ll have access to the resources and opportunities of New York City. Through partnerships and events with Asian American community organizations and cultural institutions, including the Asian American Writers’ Workshop, Kundiman, the Museum of Chinese in America, Pan-Asian Repertory Theatre, and many others, you’ll see your Asian American studies in action.

You’ll also be encouraged to participate in events at Fordham Law School’s Center on Asian Americans and the Law, which was founded by Professor Thomas Lee and the Hon. Denny Chin, senior judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in an effort to promote civic education, scholarly research, and public advocacy on Asian American legal issues.

Of course, you’ll learn more than Asian American studies here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, history, mathematics, languages, and the arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education. We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.
