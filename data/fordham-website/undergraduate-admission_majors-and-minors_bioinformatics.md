Learn to harness the power of big data and make discoveries that advance human health.

An evolving interdisciplinary field, bioinformatics is opening up new frontiers in science by allowing researchers to make sense of huge amounts of raw molecular data. Sitting at the nexus of computer science and the natural sciences, bioinformatics has allowed for in-depth study of the human genome and the genomes of plants and animals. It helped us analyze and understand the coronavirus. It is a discipline that decodes life and shows—precisely, at the genetic level—how disease begins.

As a bioinformatics minor, you’ll learn about data mining, genomics, cell biology, and the laws of chemistry. You’ll learn to use statistical software, analyze large data sets, and conduct hands-on experiments in genetics. All the while, you’ll be interacting with faculty and students from across academic fields—computer and information science, mathematics, the natural sciences—as you form your own research interests and career ambitions.

Students will also step back from science and technical skills to examine legal, societal, and ethical issues in bioinformatics. In fact, everything you learn at Fordham is examined within the bigger picture of a strong liberal arts education. Through Fordham’s core curriculum, you’ll study philosophy, theology, history, the arts, and more. We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.

The bioinformatics minor is designed for students majoring in computer and information science, biological sciences, general science, or natural science. Requirements for the minor vary by the student’s major. It generally requires only six courses (five for general science majors). The basic curriculum is shown below. Many of the courses can be counted as a requirement or elective toward one of the above majors.



Foundational courses (provide general knowledge in biology, computer science, and mathematical and computational reasoning):- Biological Science I
- Biological Science II
- Computer Science
- General Chemistry I (no lab)
- General Chemistry II (no lab)
- Discrete Structures
- Applied Statistics


Introductory and intermediate courses:


*Biological Sciences*- General Genetics with lab or Genetics with lab
- Molecular Biology with lab or Cell Biology or Cell and Developmental Biology

*Computer Science*- Information and Data Management
- Database Systems
- Data Mining or Computer and Data Analysis

*Capstone Course*- Bioinformatics

-
Bioinformatics is an in-demand skill set applicable to careers in many areas, including

- Pharmaceuticals/drug development
- Gene therapy
- Epidemiology
- Biotechnology
- Medical research
- Agricultural research
- Data and information science
- Higher education
- Software development
