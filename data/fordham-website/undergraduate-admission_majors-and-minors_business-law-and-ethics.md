Study legal and ethical principles in business.

Understanding the law is critical for the effective management of business, especially in today's ever-expanding regulatory environment. Fordham's approach to business includes a crucial additional dimension as well, one that sets it apart from many other schools of business: an education in ethics. Pursuing a minor or concentration in business law and ethics will allow you to immerse yourself in that education.

It is our belief that business cannot prosper in the long run unless it is conducted ethically. Reflecting Fordham's Jesuit tradition, the law and ethics area asks students to consider—and answer for themselves—complex questions about ethical business conduct, the underlying purpose of business, and whether businesses have an obligation to go beyond making a profit by advancing society. The law and ethics faculty prides itself on a curriculum that allows students to grapple with problems similar to those that they will encounter in the workplace.

The concepts discussed in all law and ethics classes expose students to salient issues that affect modern commerce. Asking our students to think about contemporary legal and ethical issues gives them a competitive edge. And they also consider a question that is central to business education at Fordham: Should a business exist purely for the purpose of profit, or should it contribute to society in a greater way?

The Gabelli dual-core curriculum—half business, half liberal arts—makes Fordham business graduates unique: knowledgeable about global commerce, but also keenly aware of the human factor in every deal.
