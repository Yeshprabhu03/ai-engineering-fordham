Study a language and culture central to today’s world.

The past three decades have witnessed the unprecedented development of China as the second largest economy in the world and a leading force in global politics and beyond. Mandarin Chinese is now spoken by over 1 billion people worldwide, and as the country has become increasingly open to the West, learning its language and culture has become a key to competing in many industries. China’s economic development and the critical role the country has come to play suggests the timely importance of Chinese studies.

Chinese studies looks at China both as a vital part of the world today and one of the longest continuing civilizations of human history, and it has a dual focus on language and culture. To study China is to discover global connections evidenced through language, literature, art, philosophy, religion, and history, as well as social, political, and economic structures. Majoring in Chinese studies will prepare you for a career or graduate programs in political science, international studies, finance, and other fields.

In addition, you’ll study philosophy, theology, history, mathematics, languages, and the arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education. We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.
