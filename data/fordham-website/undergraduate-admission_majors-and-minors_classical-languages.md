For 2,500 years, ancient Greece and Rome have influenced the world.

The classical languages major delves into Greek and Roman literature, history, mythology, art, philosophy, religion, and other areas—in Greek and Latin. (Per aspera ad astra!) How did Athenian democracy operate—and how was it criticized? What was the role of drama in ancient Rome? How do you conjugate learn in classical Greek?

But you’ll learn more than the classics. You’ll also study theology, mathematics, languages, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.

To paraphrase Plutarch, education is about the kindling of a flame, not the filling of a vessel.

-
You take 10 courses in the classical languages major—a mix of:

- Greek or Latin
- literature
- art
- philosophy
- archaeology

Higher level classes are conducted in Greek or Latin.
