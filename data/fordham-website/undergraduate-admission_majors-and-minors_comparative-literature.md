Of course, you’ll learn more than comparative literature here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, economics, mathematics, languages, science, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

-
Consider investigating the interactions of two or more Western or non-Western traditions; the literary and cultural expressions of diaspora communities and questions of identity and diversity; the connections between literature and other modes of understanding nature, reality and human experiences, or between literature and other modes of human communication; the interactions between verbal expressions and non-verbal experiences; or the interconnectedness among different modes of critical thinking on art, literature, nature and society. As a comparative literature major, you will take nine courses relevant to your interests and area of investigation, write a senior thesis, and participate in the senior project roundtable.

Studying abroad for a summer, a semester or a year will give you a radically different perspective on yourself and the world. Explore this option through Fordham’s International and Study Abroad Program.

You are welcome to join the editorial staff of Bricolage, a multi-disciplinary and multi-lingual journal on poetry, narrative, theater, film, the arts, culture, and theory that we publish every year.

We sponsor conferences, roundtables, lectures, and film series throughout the year. Particularly successful events are the Senior Project Roundtable, where graduating seniors present their final projects in conversation with faculty and students from multiple disciplines, and the Comparative Literature May Colloquium, a roundtable discussion on topics in comparative and interdisciplinary studies with speakers from inside and outside Fordham.
