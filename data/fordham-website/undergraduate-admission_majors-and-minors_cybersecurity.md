Want to protect people from thieves and saboteurs? Study cybersecurity.

In our increasingly digital age, with the internet being built into everything from office computers to household toys, the number of cyber threats is increasing exponentially. The demand for cybersecurity expertise will only continue to grow. The minor in cybersecurity is meant for students in any major, not just computer and information science, who want to work in this field or augment their careers with knowledge that has become essential for the security of people and organizations everywhere.

As part of the cybersecurity minor, you’ll gain an overview of cybersecurity concepts and technologies as well as plenty of problem-solving skills. You’ll learn about building a secure network, designing and debugging programs, encoding data, and securely storing and retrieving information, with case studies drawn from the fields of medicine, business, law, education, and more.

The program blends hands-on experience, small classes taught by leading experts, and all the learning and networking opportunities that come from studying cybersecurity at Fordham, [a recognized center of excellence in cyber defense education](https://news.fordham.edu/in-the-news/nsa-and-homeland-security-designate-fordham-as-a-center-for-excellence-in-cybersecurity/). And you’ll receive a strong liberal arts education through Fordham’s core curriculum, part of our efforts to educate the whole person and prepare you to succeed not only in your career, but in life as well.

-
Six courses are required for the cybersecurity minor:

- Computer Science I, with lab
- Information and Data Management
- Cybersecurity and Applications
- Secure Cyber Networks
- Data Communications and Networks
- Forensic Computing or Computer Security Systems

This minor is not available to students majoring in information science or information technology and systems, since these majors already require most of the courses in this minor. Computer science majors may minor in cybersecurity if four of the courses used for the minor are not applied to the major.

-
A background in cybersecurity can augment a wide range of careers—in business, government, education, and elsewhere. And there are plenty of options for those who focus their careers in cybersecurity:

- Information security analyst
- Cryptographer
- Security software developer
- Security engineer
- Security auditor
- Law enforcement
- Chief information security officer
- Penetration tester (“ethical hacker”)
