You will delve into a comprehensive survey of English literature to critically interpret texts and understand the principles of effective writing. You’ll contribute to our literary journals and talk shop with leading literature scholars. And you’ll do it all in New York City—the publishing capital of the world.

Of course, you’ll learn more than English here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, economics, mathematics, languages, science, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

-
We offer an English major, a concentration in creative writing, a literature minor, and a creative writing minor.

You will learn the rules, structures, and historical context of the English language as they’ve evolved during more than 1,200 years—and, when necessary, how to break those rules in the service of creative expression.

English Connect is a department-specific microsite where you can find the latest info on events, publications, and workshops.

Our Writing Center tutors provide instruction, not correction. We help you develop the tools to become a better writer. We work with you on logical, rhetorical, and grammatical issues at any stage of an assignment.
