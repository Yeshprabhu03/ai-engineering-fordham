More than 320 million people speak French worldwide, and that number is growing fast—it’s expected to exceed 700 million by 2050! That’s why French is among the most in-demand second-language skills sought by employers.

The French and Francophone studies major and minor are individualized, multidisciplinary courses of study based in the Department of Languages and Cultures. As a student, you’ll not only strengthen your language skills but also gain a more nuanced understanding of political, social, historical, and cultural practices in the Francophone world.

Here in New York City, you’ll also be able to put that understanding to work beyond the classroom. You will find academic and extracurricular opportunities to immerse yourself in the city’s rich and diverse Francophone culture and communities. And if you want to spend a semester or a year studying and living in a Francophone country, you can choose from a wide range of study abroad programs.

-
French and Francophone studies majors take a combination of 10 required and elective courses. Students who minor in the program take a combination of six required and elective courses.

Examples of recent course offerings:

- Postcolonial Representations
