Germany has one of the most powerful and diverse economies in the world. It also produces some of the world’s most influential art, literature, and film. You’ll open doors to a promising future in German-speaking countries and cultures with a degree in German language and literature from Fordham.

In Languages and Cultures, you’ll study German language, culture, and literature—the focus of our program—from medieval through postmodern times. In the process you’ll become a fluent speaker, reader, and writer in German.

We draw on a long Jesuit tradition of scholarship on and respect for the world's diverse languages and cultures—and virtually all of them are in New York City. From cultural events to people on the streets, New York City is your classroom for learning German.

You’ll learn more than German language and literature here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, economics, mathematics, ethics, science, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.

-

All literature courses are taught in German, and you will be required to speak in German in class discussions and oral presentations.

We have two Language Learning Centers for solo studying or collaboration with classmates:

- Language Learning Center at Rose Hill: a state-of-the-art, multi-use, interactive digital language laboratory with 54 self-contained computer stations equipped with the most up-to-date audio, recording, and film viewing technology.
- Olga M. Ficarra/Francis J. Morison Language Laboratory at Lincoln Center: a multi-use, interactive, computer-based facility with 25 student work stations equipped with CD, audio, video, and DVD capabilities.

We offer free tutoring in German every week on both campuses.
