We’re considered one of the top business schools in the U.S. for a reason. (For many reasons.) Our dual core curriculum—half business, half liberal arts—makes Fordham business graduates unique: skilled in global commerce, but also keenly aware of the human factor in every deal.

You will study with business leaders and moral thinkers. Global content is woven into every core curriculum course.

Our business classes will have you developing consulting recommendations for Campbell's or Under Armour, generating an idea for a startup venture, and practicing the fundamentals of financial modeling.

Our liberal arts classes will have you studying philosophers from Socrates and St. Augustine to Descartes and Kant, reading classic authors such as Shakespeare and Virgina Woolf, and experiencing the fine arts at New York City museums, concert halls, and theaters—on Broadway and off.

College is your time to develop a portfolio of professional and personal assets. The professional: knowledge, skills, and experience highly valued in our global economy. The personal: strong values, self-awareness, concern for others, and an inner drive for excellence that will serve you throughout life.

We prepare you to take a leading role in business—and have a fulfilling life outside of work.

### Internships
