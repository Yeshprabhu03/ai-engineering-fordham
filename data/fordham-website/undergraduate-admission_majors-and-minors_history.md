“Study the past if you would define the future.”—Confucius

You will study the development of peoples and nations, their interrelations and interactions, and the events that have shaped the modern world. You will come to see yourselves and your society from different times and places. This informed perspective on the world will guide your thinking and career.

You learn how to analyze societies and peoples in context—a valuable asset for many professional careers that require broad social vision and global awareness.

You’ll be taught by our highly respected history faculty, who have received teaching awards, book awards, and prestigious fellowships. They shape and administer interdisciplinary programs such as American Studies, Latin American and Latino Studies, Medieval Studies, and International Studies.

You’ll learn more than history here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, economics, mathematics, languages, science, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.
