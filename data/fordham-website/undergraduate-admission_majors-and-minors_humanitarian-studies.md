You see the injustice, poverty, and disaster zones around the world—and you must do something about them. If you believe, as we do, in Fordham’s Jesuit-inspired mission to care for others and fight for justice, the international humanitarian affairs major might be the perfect program for you.

In our interdisciplinary program, offered by the Institute for International Humanitarian Affairs, you’ll examine the global impact of disasters, disease, poverty, conflict, human rights violations, and policies. You’ll learn the tools and techniques experts use to improve lives—and cast a critical eye on complex variables like politics.

You’ll study with faculty from international affairs, political science, philosophy, history, and anthropology, and learn from experts from the UN, NGOs, and the private sector.

From technical innovations used to help populations in crisis to theoretical critiques of humanitarian activities, our program will expose you to challenging situations—and innovative solutions.

You’ll learn more than international humanitarian studies here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, literature, languages, ethics, science, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.

-
As an international humanitarian affairs major, you take four required courses:

- Introduction to Humanitarian Action: Theory and Practice
- Foreign Service Program
- Internship Seminar
- Senior Thesis Seminar

You also take six electives drawn from three subject areas:

- History, philosophy, and anthropology
- Humanitarian affairs, political science, sociology, and economics
- Communications, literary studies, and women’s studies

### Internships

The internship seminar is an essential element of the major, because you’ll gain priceless experience working at an international nongovernmental organization (NGO) or intergovernmental organization (IGO) in New York City, world headquarters of the United Nations. You’ll learn about the structure and inner workings of NGOs and IGOs that work in:

- global health
- world poverty
- hunger alleviation
- human rights
- international law
- global governance
- women’s rights
- conflict resolution
- peacekeeping
- international education

Guest speakers regularly attend the weekly internship seminar to help students connect their ongoing, individual intern experience to the big picture of international humanitarian aid and development.

We’ll connect you with our many partner organizations, and help you sharpen your resume and cover letter. But ultimately, landing the internship is up to you.
