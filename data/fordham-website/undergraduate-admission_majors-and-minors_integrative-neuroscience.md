Our primary aim is to make you a highly competitive candidate for postgraduate study in neuroscience through our uniquely integrative program. You’ll choose from three tracks focusing on a specific aspect of neuroscience—cell and molecular, cognitive, or systems and computational—but you’ll get exposure to all of them. We want you to have multiple perspectives on this exhilarating field of study.

We also prepare you by requiring you to engage in Neuroscience research by completing an independent project during your time here. Get ready to be fascinated.

Your education will extend far beyond rigorous study of the brain and its functions. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, economics, mathematics, ethics, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.

-
As an interdisciplinary program, Integrative Neuroscience requires its students to take 16 courses across three departments: Biology/Natural Science, Psychology, and Computer and Information Science. These are a mix of broad foundational courses and more specialized upper level courses. You also must participate in a research project for at least two semesters.

There are three tracks to choose from:

- Cell and Molecular
- Cognitive
- Systems and Computational

### Internships

Students contribute to research projects at Fordham as well as at other local institutions such as Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Mt. Sinai Medical School. We are fortunate to be located in New York City where we are surrounded by leaders in the field of neuroscience, and we look forward to expanding the opportunities available to our students in coming years.
