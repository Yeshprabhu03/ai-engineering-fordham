How do businesses, governments, and people in our interdependent global economy make sound—or risky—economic decisions? What are the factors, motivations, and contexts underlying those choices? In the international political economy major at Fordham, we take an interdisciplinary approach to finding answers to these questions.

Economic systems don’t occur in a vacuum. That’s why we turn to history, political science, and anthropology to deepen our understanding. You must have a high GPA to pursue this major and a keen interest in the world outside our borders. You’ll graduate with a clear and concise approach to critically assessing a wide range of issues.

Good teaching is a top priority for our faculty. We keep class sizes small, the coursework engaging, and the standards high.

You’ll learn more than international political economy here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, history, literature, languages, science, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.

Because of its rigor, the international political economy major is open only to students of Fordham College at Rose Hill who have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or better.

You take eight core courses in political science, economics, anthropology, and quantitative techniques and then specialize your studies further with four electives according to your interests.

Special tracks in language study and global business will make quite an impression on graduate schools and employers.
