Study how Irish history and culture fits into a global society.

Fordham’s Institute of Irish Studies, home to the first Irish studies program in the United States, provides an interdisciplinary, intercampus minor that seeks to promote a serious and thoughtful appreciation of Irish history, culture, and society. As an Irish studies minor, you’ll be allowed to tailor your emphasis to your own interests, picking from a variety of classes including courses in history, literature, language, theatre, religious studies, art, music, and the social sciences, giving you a mature understanding of Ireland and the Irish diaspora, particularly in America.

The Irish studies minor is designed to promote a historical and cultural understanding of Ireland through its language, literature, and diaspora. This focus includes the Irish contribution— intellectually, spiritually, artistically—to Western civilization, as well as Ireland’s experience as one of the first post-colonial nations. From poetry to politics, the minor engages with a rich and varied culture and may be of particular interest to students of Irish descent exploring their place—historical and contemporary—in a pluralistic society.

Of course, you’ll learn more than Irish studies here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, history, mathematics, languages, and the arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education. We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.

Irish studies is well-suited as a minor for students majoring in English, comparative literature, communication and media studies, history, or political science. However, the program is designed to be approachable from all majors, and allows students to pick their own specialization in Irish studies. It is possible to do a major in Irish studies by consulting with the class dean and the program director of Irish studies and designing an individualized major.

As a minor, you’ll select one course in Irish literature, one course in Irish history, and four elective courses.

Irish Literature Courses:

- Modern Drama as Moral Crucible
- Contemporary Irish Literature

Irish History:

- Medieval Ireland
- The Tudors
- The World of Queen Elizabeth
- 20th Century Ireland

-
A minor in Irish studies will help prepare you for a career in fields such as diplomacy and international relations, economics, teaching, publishing, journalism, public relations, marketing, theatre, and civil service.

The Institute of Irish Studies has facilitated internships at such places as the Irish Consulate, Irish theatre groups, and Irish publications in New York City.
