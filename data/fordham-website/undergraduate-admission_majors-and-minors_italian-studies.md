Italian is a vibrant living language borne of a world-changing culture 2,500 years old.

Self-directed? Ambitious? A lover of Italian books, films, and culture? If you want to blaze your own path to fluency in Italian language and culture, the Italian area studies major at Fordham might be right for you.

It’s a highly individualized, interdisciplinary course of study based in the Department of Languages and Cultures. With the help of a faculty advisor, you’ll craft a rigorous course of study that fits your passions and ambitions. Most of your classes will be in Italian. You’ll study a broad range of topics, including art history, classical languages, political science, and visual arts.

In the process, you’ll become fluent in Italian, refine your analytical skills, and acquire a critical understanding of Italian literary and cultural tradition over the centuries.

We draw on a long Jesuit tradition of scholarship on and respect for the world's diverse languages and cultures—and virtually all of them are in New York City. From cultural events to people on the streets, New York City is your classroom for learning Italian.

You’ll learn more than Italian language and literature here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, economics, mathematics, ethics, science, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.
