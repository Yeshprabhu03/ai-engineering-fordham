Study the science of language.

With Fordham’s linguistics minor, you’ll train in the scientific study of language, developing a fuller understanding of the complexities of human communication. By completing this minor, you will develop a heightened awareness of what language is, how language works and is used, and how the study of language intersects with a multitude of disciplines.

The linguistics minor provides students with tools for studying language from diverse perspectives, and these skills complement several areas, including anthropology, biology, business, computer science, education, languages and cultures, neuroscience, psychology, and sociology.

Of course, you’ll learn more than linguistics here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, history, mathematics, languages, and the arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education. We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.
