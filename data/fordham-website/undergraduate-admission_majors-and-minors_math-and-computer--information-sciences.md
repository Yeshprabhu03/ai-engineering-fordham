An interdisciplinary degree for today’s high-tech world.

Imagine entering today’s workforce with a degree that applies mathematical concepts to the technology that drives our modern world. Fordham’s interdisciplinary major in Math and Computer & Information sciences will prepare you to understand the potential of emerging technology—and to help create it.

As a Math and Computer & Information Sciences major, you can choose to concentrate in ether mathematics or computer and information sciences; your classes, however, will span both disciplines—and merge the two. You’ll use math to solve computer science problems, and you’ll use technology to further explore mathematical questions.

And you’ll go beyond both fields. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, history, science, languages, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education. We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.

-
As a BS student in mathematics-computer and information sciences, you take at least 14 classes: 10 required courses, two courses from one concentration, and two electives. There are two concentrations*:

- Mathematics
- Computer and Information Sciences

*At least one elective must be from mathematics if the computer and information science concentration is chosen, and at least one elective must be in computer and information science if the mathematics concentration is chosen.

We also offer:

- A separate mathematics major
- A separate computer science major
- An Informatics and Data Mining Lab that conducts research in the emerging fields of computational intelligence and informatics related to:
- bioinformatics, brain informatics, cognitive informatics, and neuroinformatics
- financial computing and informatics
- business analytics and business intelligence
- combinatorial fusion analysis

- A Robotics and Computer Vision Lab that investigates the frontiers of robotics, including developing software to built robot systems for defense, visual homing systems inspired by ants and bees, and fusing data from a team of robots on a search-and-rescue mission.
- A WISDM (Wireless Sensor Data Mining) Lab that collects, mines, and analyzes sensor data from smart phones and other mobile devices using activity recognition, biometric identification and trait recognition. The lab is supported by NSF funding and has received a Google Faculty Research Award.
