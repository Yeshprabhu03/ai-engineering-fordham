Offered jointly by the departments of economics and mathematics, it’s a highly challenging course of study that fosters careful reasoning and abstract formulations. To put it plainly, you must be smart to be here. You’ll study a heady mix of complex math and economic theory. And you’ll graduate with a degree that stands out on job and school applications.

You’ll learn more than interdisciplinary math and economics here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, literature, languages, ethics, science, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.
