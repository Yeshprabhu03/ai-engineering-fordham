We’re one of the few schools in the U.S. to offer an interdisciplinary undergraduate major in Middle Eastern studies. You’ll begin with language training in modern standard Arabic—a distinctive asset. You’ll then explore the cultures of the Middle East and North Africa from ancient to modern times, from Morocco in the west to Afghanistan in the east, and from Turkey in the north to Somalia in the south.

You’ll take courses in history, anthropology, political science, art history, economics, religion, philosophy, and literature. The Middle East will come alive with meaning—and you will graduate ready for a career or advanced study in the field.

You’ll learn more than Middle East studies here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, literature, languages, ethics, mathematics, science, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.
