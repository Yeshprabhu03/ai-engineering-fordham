You’ll study a combination of music history, theory, composition, and performance in one of the world’s music capitals. We emphasize careful formal analysis and investigation of the social, historical, and economic conditions driving cultural production. You’ll also compose, score, and perform.

But you’ll learn more than music here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, history, mathematics, languages, sciences, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.

-
As a music major, you take 10 classes—a mix of music theory, performance, and history. We limit our lecture classes to 35 students to promote dialogue and debate.

Some of our students combine the music major with another field of study. Those interested in artist management or the music industry might double major in music and economics or business.

**Internships**We connect you with music internships at recording companies and concert agencies throughout New York City.

Fordham’s Career Services offers CareerLink, database of thousands of job and internship opportunities exclusively for Fordham students.

**Study Abroad**Study abroad enriches you academically, culturally, and personally. There is a globe of possibilities available through Fordham’s International and Study Abroad Program.
