Our program combines the forces of multiple departments: communication and media studies, visual arts, English, computer and information science, and business.

You’ll develop innovative technical capabilities. You’ll examine the new modes of information-gathering, collaboration, democratic participation, and self-expression. You’ll gain a deep social, historical, and ethical understanding of new media.

And you’ll graduate ready to skillfully navigate an ever-evolving media environment.

But you’ll learn more than new media and digital design here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, history, mathematics, languages, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.

-
As a major in design and technology, you have three concentrations to choose from:

- New Media and Information
- Art, Text and Design
- New Media and Commerce

You take 11 classes—four core courses, an ethics, new media and digital design course, and six electives.

### Internships

We take advantage of our unique location at Lincoln Center, right in the heart of NYC, to connect you to New York City’s thriving media industry. We think internships are so important—and often lead to jobs—that we require you to take at least one before graduation.

Fordham’s Career Services offers CareerLink, database of thousands of job and internship opportunities exclusively for Fordham students.
