We acquaint you with the intellectual and moral traditions of civilization to help you think clearly and carefully for yourself. Our course of study is pluralistic and broad-minded, and taught by faculty internationally recognized for their scholarship. You’ll explore a wide variety of schools of thought, including contemporary philosophy (American, analytic, continental, environmental, feminist, Thomistic) as well as epistemology, ethics, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of religion.

You will question assumptions and critique principles. You’ll see logic as a practice, analyze abstract conceptual relationships, and interpret difficult texts. And you’ll develop the analytical, critical, and argumentative skills that employers and graduate schools in many fields seek in their future leaders. Example: a philosophy degree is one of the best preparations for law school.

But you’ll learn more than philosophy here. You’ll also study literature, theology, history, mathematics, languages, sciences, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.
