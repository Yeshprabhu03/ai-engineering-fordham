You’ll learn a broad range of physics principles in classes, dedicated labs, research projects, and internships. Class sizes are small; we get to know you well. You will join our explorations into applied optics, condensed matter physics, nanoelectronic device modeling, medical physics, nuclear physics, and other fields.

But you’ll learn more than physics here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, history, literature, languages, ethics, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.

-
The physics major is available at Fordham College at Rose Hill. Our program is designed to prepare you for graduate study in physics. It’s rigorous and sequential, with 20 required classes.

### Facilities and Research Opportunities

We are avid researchers. Join our explorations of the physical nature of the universe. Our labs include:

- Solid State Physics Laboratory
- Soft Condensed Matter Laboratory
- Physics of Materials and Polymers Laboratory
- Instrument and Model Shop

### Additional Resources

- Center for Computational Physics
- Advanced Electronics Laboratory
- Observational Astronomy Resources
- Introductory Physics Laboratory

We have active research programs in nuclear?and particle physics (theory) and in theoretical condensed matter (mesoscopic and nanoscale) physics.

Our experimental research focuses on:

- Materials science
- Polymer physics
- Low-temperature physics
- Liquid crystals
- Medical physics
- Laser optics

The physics department operates Fordham’s historic seismic station, which houses a state-of-the-art broadband seismometer and strong motion detector under a USGS program to assess earthquake risk remediation in large metropolitan centers.

Want to connect, network, learn and compete?

Join our active physics club to take part in annual tours to area research labs and events in the department.

Present your work professionally. In recent years our students have presented at American Physical Society national meeting and won a NASA competition for undergraduate experiments in zero gravity (and flew with their experiment on a NASA airplane).

Our tutoring center can help you with introductory physics courses.

And don’t forget your mitt. We go head-to-head with the chemistry department in an annual softball game.

### Study Abroad

Take your coursework global with a study abroad program. Fordham has connections with more than 150 programs in universities all over the world, including Germany, China, Turkey, Argentina, and the Gabelli London satellite campus.
