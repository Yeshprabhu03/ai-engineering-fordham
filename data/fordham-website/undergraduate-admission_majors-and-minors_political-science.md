“Democracy is when the indigent, and not the men of property, are the rulers.” — Aristotle

You will study one of four concentrations—American politics, comparative politics, international politics, or political theory—with faculty who are active, award-winning scholars in the field of political science. We prepare you to think independently, tolerate a diversity of viewpoints, engage with current political affairs (both at home and abroad), and critically analyze the relationship between personal values and public life.

You’ll also hone your skills in writing, communication, and analytical thought.

These are all core components of a Jesuit liberal arts education at Fordham.

But you’ll learn more than political science here. You’ll also study philosophy, literature, theology, art, history, mathematics, languages, sciences, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.

-
As a political science major, you take 10 classes. There are four subfields to choose from:
