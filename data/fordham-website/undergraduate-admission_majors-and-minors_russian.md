Study a language and culture that is key to understanding international relations.

When you minor in Russian, you’ll study a historic language and culture that is central to our global society. Russian speakers are in high demand throughout the world, especially in fields like intelligence, international diplomacy, and business.

Our curriculum reflects the Standards for Foreign Language Learning in the 21st Century, which describes the five C's of language acquisition: communication, culture, comparisons, connections, and community. With the Russian minor, you’ll have the opportunity to practice the three modes of communication (interpersonal, interpretive, and presentational), to learn about Russian culture, and to make comparisons between your first language and culture and the Russian language and culture.

Of course, you’ll learn more than Russian here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, history, mathematics, languages, and the arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education. We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.
