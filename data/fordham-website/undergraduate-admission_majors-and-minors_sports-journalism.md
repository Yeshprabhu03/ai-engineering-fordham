With Fordham’s minor in sports journalism you’ll develop broad journalistic skills and receive specific sports journalism training. But we go beyond the stats to examine issues of ethics, race, and gender in the world of athletics. And you’ll learn how the field intersects with disciplines such as business, biology, and sociology. Through this minor, students not majoring in journalism can still learn the skills they need to report on both the play-by-play and the world off the field.

Our faculty members are a dynamic mix of media scholars and professional journalists who serve as models of critical dialogue within the field. And the award-winning sports division of WFUV, Fordham’s public media station, offers plenty of opportunities for hands-on experience right on campus.

But you’ll learn more than sports journalism here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, history, mathematics, languages, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.
