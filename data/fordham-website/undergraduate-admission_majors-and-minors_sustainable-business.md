Learn how to conduct business with a purpose and benefit humans around the world.

As a sustainable business minor at Fordham’s Gabelli School of Business, you’ll come to understand what turns a leader into a changemaker, and how you can apply those skills from the smallest startups to the largest multinational firms.

Fordham students don’t simply want to do business. They want to change the world. Studying sustainable business helps students learn how to make a difference and conduct business with purpose. The sustainable business minor keeps in mind the “triple bottom line” of people, planet, and profit. It incorporates business, social science, natural science, and building-design curricula, and can enhance your career opportunities in traditional business markets and in the emerging “green sector.” The minor draws students who wish to alleviate poverty, promote justice, protect human rights, and respect the environment, and aligns seamlessly with Fordham's mission to promote education and research that accomplishes these goals.

You will see how business can still turn a profit while benefiting human beings around the world: leading with empathy, providing better working conditions, improving the environment, and finding paths to innovation where others see closed doors.

The Gabelli dual core curriculum—half business, half liberal arts—makes Fordham business graduates unique: knowledgeable about global commerce, but also keenly aware of the human factor in every deal.

Students who pursue the sustainable business minor take the foundations course, Sustainable Business, and six additional courses. Courses vary depending on whether the student is a Gabelli School student, an FCRH student majoring in a science, or an FCRH student pursuing a nonscience major, but are taken from across many academic departments and include:

- Sustainable Business Foundations
- Social Entrepreneurship
- Sustainability and Finance
- Entrepreneurship and Fair Trade
- Spirituality, Fair Trade, and Social Justice
- Fair Trade and Microfinance
