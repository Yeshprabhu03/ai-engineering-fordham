Master the art of the stage-and film and TV-in the world capital of the performing arts.

Acting. Directing. Designing. Playwriting. Acquire the skills needed to succeed in stage, film, and TV in the Theatre Program at Fordham. We're located in the cultural heart of New York City, just steps from the Broadway and Off-Broadway theatre districts. Fordham Theatre is one of the top BA theatre training programs in the country.

Fordham Theatre combines the intimacy of a small conservatory with exceptional liberal arts education.

Entrance into our program is highly competitive. You'll audition, or submit a portfolio and interview with our dedicated faculty.

In addition to existing need-based aid and merit scholarships, applicants will also be evaluated for audition-based artistic scholarships.

And of course, you’ll learn more than theatre here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, economics, mathematics, languages, and science through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

Our pre-professional program includes a rigorous and well-balanced curriculum, and hands-on training, on and off the stage.

There are four theatre concentrations:

- Performance
- Design and Production
- Directing
- Playwriting

We believe theatre is an interdisciplinary art, so we emphasize the collaborative links between these disciplines.

All theatre students are members of the Fordham Theatre Company. Every season we produce four professionally-directed main stage productions, and 20 student-driven studio theatre productions.

Our program has three studio spaces:

- Veronica Lally Kehoe Theatre, a state-of-the-art theatre
- White Box Theatre
- Franny’s Space

### Internships

Our theatre majors intern at leading theatre, film, and television companies. Often an intern will be hired by an organization upon graduation—and then bring on Fordham interns in the future.

Some recent internships:

- Cherry Lane Theatre
- Disney
- The Public Theater
- Saturday Night Live
- The Tony Awards
- CNN
- Joey Parnes Production Office
- Cornerstone Talent
- New Dramatists

### Study Abroad

Many theatre majors spend their junior year abroad in cities London, Rome, and Paris. There is a whole globe of study abroad possibilities available through Fordham’s International and Study Abroad Program.
