Think critically about questions of God, human existence, and the role of religious traditions in our lives.

What does it mean to be human? How shall we live? What does it mean to believe in (or reject) the existence of God? Why are there so many religions? As a theology major at Fordham, you’ll explore these profound questions through an intellectually sophisticated engagement with the Christian tradition in dialogue with other faiths.

In light of Fordham’s Jesuit heritage, our program focuses on the rich diversity within the Catholic tradition. You’ll discover, interpret, and understand the evolving beliefs and practices of Christianity through a variety of disciplines, including history, philosophy, and literature. Your coursework will emphasize the mutual influence of faith and culture historically and in the present.

You’ll make connections between the world’s religious and moral teachings and the realities of social injustice, which are widely on display in New York City. You’ll confront these contradictions both morally and practically through service to others.

You’ll learn more than theology here. You’ll also study philosophy, literature, art, history, mathematics, languages, sciences, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.

As a theology major, you take 10 classes covering foundational study in three disciplines:

- Historical Theology
- Systematic Theology

Our five-year accelerated MA program allows theology majors to attain both a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree in theology in five years.

Fordham’s Career Services offers CareerLink, a database of thousands of job and internship opportunities exclusively for Fordham students.

### Facilities

The Francis and Ann Curran Center for American Catholic Studies hosts national conferences, public lectures, fora and readings, academic seminars and conversations, and publishes both scholarly and imaginative works.

We host a chapter of Theta Alpha Kappa, the national honor society in theology and religious studies.

Every semester, we offer many program activities, including:

- Guest speakers
- Movie series
- Musical events
- Monthly faculty seminars
- Study trips
- Informal gatherings with faculty

### Study Abroad

Study abroad enriches you academically, culturally, and personally. There is a globe of possibilities available through Fordham’s International and Study Abroad Program.

### Service Learning

Many theology students explore the core Jesuit concept of

*homines pro aliis*—“men and women for others”—through service learning opportunities at the Center for Community Engaged Learning. Here you’ll connect service, justice, community, and spirituality. -
