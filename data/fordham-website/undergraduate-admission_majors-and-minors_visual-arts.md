Work closely with Fordham faculty as you develop your technical skills and define your artistic voice. At Fordham, all of New York City is your campus. Museum and gallery tours, studio visits, and visiting artist lectures are an integral part of the curriculum. Small class sizes allow you to forge close relationships with professors and fellow students.

Our Lincoln Center campus is steps away from MoMA, the Guggenheim, and the Met. For a more traditional on-campus experience, head uptown to Rose Hill—just a short train or van ride away—where you’ll study across the street from the New York Botanical Garden and the Visual Arts Complex has a beautiful sky-lit studio space with terrazzo floors and a state-of-the-art computer lab.

Either way, a short subway or train ride brings you to the endless galleries and arts activities of Chelsea, the Lower East Side, and Brooklyn.

We believe educational diversity is critical to the training of an artist—and that creativity and visual understanding are integral parts of a broadly searching mind.

That’s why you’ll learn more than visual arts here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, history, literature, mathematics, languages, science, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.

-
We offer six visual arts areas of study at our Lincoln Center and Rose Hill campuses.

- Art & Engagement: Explore the relationships and contexts of artmaking and viewing
- Built Environment: Prepare for a career in architecture or urban planning with a combination of studio and lecture classes
- Film and Video: Create your own experimental, narrative, or documentary films and learn film history
- Graphic Design: Study the principles of design and typography from a critical, social, historical, and theoretical perspective
- Painting and Drawing: Learn traditional and modern technical skills, art theory, and creative expression
- Photography: Develop your darkroom and digital skills and learn the historical and critical context of the medium

Studios and computer labs at both campuses are available to students when classes are not in session, including weekends, evenings, and summers.

### Galleries

We have two galleries at the Lincoln Center campus:

- The Ildiko Butler Gallery features thematic group exhibitions of contemporary photographers, painters, architects, designers, and filmmakers.
- The Lipani Gallery features solo and group exhibitions of student work as well as work by professional artists, architects, and designers.

Both galleries are dedicated to solo and two-person senior-thesis shows in the spring.
