## Explore the Rose Hill Campus

Our Rose Hill Campus is an 85-acre campus bordered on two sides by the amazing, lush New York Botanical Garden, and the Wildlife Conservation Society’s 265-acre Bronx Zoo is across the street. Tree-lined walkways and Gothic architecture. Fordham’s athletics. WFUV’s studios. Yankee Stadium. The real Little Italy.

## Explore the Lincoln Center Campus

Our Lincoln Center campus is in the heart of New York City, surrounded by exactly what you have in mind: Skyscrapers. Big business. City lights. We're a subway ride to Wall Street, a stone’s throw from media giants, across town from the United Nations, steps to Central Park, and blocks from Broadway.
