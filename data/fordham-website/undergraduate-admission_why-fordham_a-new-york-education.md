# A New York Education

## What’s the best college town? New York City!

More than half a million college students from across the country and around the world attend the 100-plus colleges and universities in NYC.

At Fordham, you’ll get more than a rigorous academic education in the Jesuit tradition. You’ll get the support and resources you need to navigate—and make an impact in—the most diverse, dynamic city in the world.

## From the heart of Manhattan and the Bronx

[Just 8 miles separate our two undergraduate campuses, and both offer a complete New York City experience.]

[Lincoln Center in Manhattan](/undergraduate-admission/why-fordham/a-new-york-education/lincoln-center/): A subway to Wall Street. A stone’s throw from major media networks. Across town from the United Nations. Hand-in-hand with Alvin Ailey. Steps to Central Park. Blocks from Broadway.

[Rose Hill in the Bronx](/undergraduate-admission/why-fordham/a-new-york-education/rose-hill/): Tree-lined walkways and Gothic architecture. Fordham’s athletics. Walsh Library. WFUV’s studios. Yankee Stadium. The Botanical Garden and the Bronx Zoo. The real Little Italy.

[The Ram Van](/student-life/department-of-transportation/ram-van-shuttle/), our intercampus shuttle, conveniently and directly connects the two.

BIG CITY ENERGY, SMALL CAMPUS FEEL

-

We offer voluntary pre-orientation programs over the summer and a mandatory three-day orientation program for all students before classes start to help you feel at home in your new city.

[Our new student orientation program](/student-life/events-and-activities/student-orientation/)introduces you to new people, gives you insights into navigating campus and New York, and helps make your community feel a lot smaller. -

The top priority of

[Fordham’s Department of Public Safety](/student-life/safety-health-and-wellness/public-safety/)is to ensure the well-being of the entire University community, on all campuses, at all times. To do that, we have public safety team members on duty 24/7/365 at both campuses; run nightly off-campus shuttles at the Rose Hill campus; provide student safety programs; and work with our New York State-certified ambulance corps staffed by student volunteers—FUEMS—to respond to emergencies during the academic year. -

Our

[Urban Plunge program](/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/external-affairs/center-for-community-engaged-learning/student-programming/urban-plunge/)introduces incoming first-year students to returning students to reflect on the challenges some New Yorkers face. They get to know a neighborhood on a personal level and take part in local efforts to alleviate hunger, promote affordable housing, and foster community development. -

[Global Transition](/academics/academic-resources/international-services/programs-and-events/global-transition/), a four-day program, introduces incoming undergraduate international students to Fordham through orientations, campus tours, and trips across New York City. Our goal is to help you connect with new friends, get your questions answered, and feel comfortable in your new city.
