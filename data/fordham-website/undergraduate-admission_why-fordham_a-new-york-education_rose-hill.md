# Study at our Rose Hill Campus

## More Than Just Old-School Beauty

The birthplace of hip-hop. The home of the New York Yankees. Green. Gothic. A place for you to grow.

We may not be what you’re expecting from New York City - our 85-acre campus is bordered on two sides by the amazing, lush New York Botanical Garden, and the Wildlife Conservation Society’s 265-acre Bronx Zoo is across the street.

## A classic campus tucked into the Bronx

Our neighborhood in the North Bronx, where you’ll find our Rose Hill campus, is rich with history, diversity, culture, and local flavor.

Just walk down Fordham Road and find good, cheap eats, a comic book, or a new pair of sneakers. Go check out the real Little Italy on Arthur Avenue. Looking for the hustle and bustle of the city? Hop on a subway and emerge in the middle of Manhattan. We’re every bit a part of Gotham.
