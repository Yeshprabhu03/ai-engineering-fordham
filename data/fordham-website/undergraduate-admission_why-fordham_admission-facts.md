## Enrollment Overview

At Fordham, our students attend classes across three campuses—the urban [Lincoln Center campus](/about/campuses/lincoln-center-campus/) in the heart of Manhattan; our Gothic [Rose Hill campus](/about/campuses/rose-hill-campus/) in the Bronx; and our [professional campus](/about/campuses/westchester-campus/) in Westchester (which houses only graduate programs).
