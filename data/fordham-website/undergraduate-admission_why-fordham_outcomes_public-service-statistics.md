# Public Service Statistics

Back to [Undergraduate Outcomes](/undergraduate-admission/why-fordham/outcomes/). See also [leading industries](/undergraduate-admission/why-fordham/outcomes/leading-industries-statistics/) and [top hiring employers](/undergraduate-admission/why-fordham/outcomes/top-hiring-employers-statistics/).

Fordham graduates will carry their commitment to be men and women for others with them for the rest of their lives. Some take that responsibility a step further dedicating time after graduation to public service. In fact, Fordham is in the top 25 for medium-sized colleges sending the most volunteers to the [Peace Corps](https://news.fordham.edu/commencement/2019/graduates-take-community-engaged-learning-to-the-nation-and-the-world/).
