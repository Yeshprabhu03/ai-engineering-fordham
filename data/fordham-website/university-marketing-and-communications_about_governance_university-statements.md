# Framework for Issuing University Statements

The University supports and encourages engagement with current issues and events by every member of the campus community. The intent of this framework is to ensure there is every opportunity at Fordham for vigorous academic, social, and political debate, and to center the University’s educational work, by abstaining from official University positions on such issues. Fordham and its leaders may make statements only if one or more of the following criteria are met:

- Issues or events directly affect Fordham University’s ability to deliver upon its mission (examples include legislation or U.S. Supreme Court rulings impacting University operations);
- Issues or events directly disrupt students/faculty/staff’s ability to function in their roles in contributing to our campus community (examples include changes to the F-1 academic student visa program, DACA, etc.);
- Issues or events cause severe disruption to the Fordham community, where reaffirming our commitment to the University’s values and sense of cohesion has the ability to effect change (examples include natural disasters, national unrest, etc.).

For national and global matters that affect certain groups within the Fordham community—but which fall outside the above criteria—the University will continue to take a personalized approach to outreach, and provide resources to members of our community who are directly affected.

Fordham will not issue statements on behalf of other organizations or groups, nor endorse or oppose political figures or parties.

Colleges, schools, centers, and divisions are encouraged to share University-issued statements with stakeholders. Should a unit find it necessary to issue a statement in addition to, or in the absence of, a University-issued communication, the unit should consult with both their respective vice president/provost and the vice president for marketing and communications.

Fordham University’s position on statements does not curtail any individual’s right to make statements representing their personal views, as long as it is clear that they are not speaking nor writing on behalf of the University.
