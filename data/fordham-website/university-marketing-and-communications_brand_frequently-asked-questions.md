# Brand FAQs

Fordham University is undertaking a brand evolution to sharpen its identity in an increasingly competitive higher education marketplace. This initiative aims to drive distinction, raise Fordham’s profile across various audiences, and improve brand awareness.

Key factors that prompted this change include:

**Building Brand Awareness:**Research indicated that only a portion of the national audience is familiar with Fordham, with less familiarity outside the tristate area. Specifically, only 16.9% of New Yorkers correctly identified the “Block F” as belonging to Fordham, and awareness was even lower in other cities.

A new visual identity for Fordham University can significantly increase brand awareness by creating a more cohesive, distinctive, and easily recognizable presence across all platforms and communications.

**Enhancing Market Perception and Increasing Yield:**The University seeks to elevate its profile and be the top choice for more students. Research indicates that while Fordham provides a high-quality education and is perceived as somewhat prestigious, it lags behind some of its better-known peers.

By aligning the visual elements with the core value proposition—”Fordham develops curious minds and caring hearts to ignite change around the world” —the University aims to present a clear, unified message. This cohesion across visual and verbal communication will help external audiences better understand and recall Fordham’s unique identity.

**Modernizing the Brand:**Fordham’s current brand was developed pre-Internet! The visual identity does not display well at smaller sizes or across digital platforms. Additionally, the University sought to find messaging that ties Fordham’s Jesuit values together in a distinctive way, using accessible language that resonates with prospective students and their families.

The development of Fordham University’s new brand identity was a strategic, multiphase effort that began in March 2024. The project was a collaboration between Fordham’sUniversity Marketing and Communications (UMC) division and external agency partner

[Ologie](https://ologie.com/), involving extensive research and various stakeholders across campus.Here’s a breakdown of the key phases and activities involved:

**Audience Research**Both qualitative and quantitative research revealed in-depth insights into perceptions, attitudes, and experiences of various Fordham stakeholders. Discovery sessions and focus groups explored the nuances of Fordham’s brand identity. A multiple-stakeholder perception online survey, completed by more than 8,600 Fordham faculty, staff, students, alumni, prospective students, and employers, helped us establish a benchmark for current perceptions and awareness, understand strengths and weaknesses, and inform strategic direction.**Brand Platform Development**Research revealed a cohesive brand story but also highlighted that Fordham is not considered as prestigious as some of its closest peers. Fordham was found to be distinctive for support, having a “caring community,” having “great educators dedicated to student success,” and fostering “mentorship and academic support.” Career outcomes and NYC access were also identified as significant factors.These insights led to a defined brand strategy with components including a core value proposition, brand pillars, and brand personality, as well as a new visual identity.

**Testing and Optimization**

Early iterations of new brand messaging were tested against current Fordham messaging and messaging from our peers, but did not perform as well as expected. The messaging was overhauled and retested, which helped us land on a very strong messaging platform that clearly resonates with our constituents.The Fordham community has provided valuable input on the new brand identity at every stage. It has been shared with faculty, staff, students, alumni, and donors in committee meetings and focus groups, with particular guidance from Fordham’s Brand Council and Leadership Brand Council (see below).

-
Fordham’s seal is still an important part of the University’s identity. Moving forward, the seal will be elevated in distinction and reserved for special uses by the president’s office, such as commencement.

-
Yes. In addition to participation in the initial on-campus discovery sessions and focus groups, all faculty and administrators were invited to complete an online survey as part of the quantitative research, with 600-plus responses submitted. The brand platform was shared with the Faculty Senate and Deans’ Councils. Additionally, a select group of faculty and administrators participated in Fordham’s Brand Council.

The Fordham Brand Council was established to ensure strong collaboration from all four corners of the University during the brand platform development. Its role includes providing feedback and shaping the progress of the brand strategy initiative. Members of this council also serve as a conduit to keep their peers and colleagues informed of progress being made to strengthen the Fordham brand.

-
Alumni focus groups helped inform the initial research phase, and all alumni were also invited to participate in the quantitative research, with 2,700-plus responses received to the online survey. Alumni were also represented on Fordham’s Brand Leadership Council.

Fordham’s Brand Leadership Council consists of alumni, parents, donors, and trustees who provided executive-level guidance throughout the brand development process. Comprised of marketing and branding experts, business leaders, philanthropic advocates, and Fordham ambassadors, the Brand Leadership Council has provided invaluable expertise to help shape Fordham’s evolved brand platform.

-
More than 1,000 current undergraduates and 800-plus current graduate students completed the online research survey. And throughout the process, UMC consulted its Fordham Pulse group, a pool of 100-plus Fordham students who engage in focus groups to provide feedback on marketing initiatives. In testing the new identity with this group, 87% of students acknowledged a positive response, and 91% of students found the new identity appealing.

Additionally, Fordham surveyed groups of prospective undergraduate (1,000-plus) and graduate students (700-plus)—both those who are already interacting with the University as part of the application process and those who are not yet affiliated with Fordham—to gauge awareness and perceptions.

-
The new brand platform is designed to deeply connect with Fordham’s history, mission, and values by drawing inspiration from its Jesuit heritage, the Fordham seal, and its renowned architecture.

The research reinforced that Fordham’s Jesuit mission is seen as a core pillar of its identity and contributes to its distinction. The new identity aims to show, not just tell, this aspect. The core value proposition—“Fordham develops curious minds and caring hearts to ignite change around the world”—directly reflects Jesuit values like

*cura personalis*(care for the whole person) and educating for justice.The new visual identity incorporates a “Gothic F” that directly connects to Fordham’s distinctive architecture, particularly the Gothic Revival style prevalent on its historic Rose Hill campus. Combining the “Gothic F” with the shield from Fordham’s seal bridges the gap between the University’s physical structures and its modern brand. This design choice provides a sense of historical continuity and timelessness, ensuring that the new identity feels authentic and deeply rooted in Fordham’s heritage.

-
Yes, Fordham will always be “The Jesuit University of New York.” However, the tagline will no longer be locked up as part of Fordham’s visual identity moving forward.

-
“For What Matters” is a campaign slogan that will be used in advertising and marketing materials. It was developed as part of the brand platform to help communicate Fordham’s Jesuit mission concisely in a way that will be easily understood.
