### New Training Resources

We are excited to offer additional training and troubleshooting resources along with our [virtual Web Content Management Training sessions](/university-marketing-and-communications/website-management/web-content-management-training/). These resources walk you through steps such as creating pages, adding and editing content, uploading images and PDFs, adding links, renaming pages, and more. Additional resources will be added in the very near future!
