# Hosting Options

The Office of Internet Services **cannot** offer support for the content or configuration or development of your Blog or Wiki site. We will provide you with an approved template which you are expected to keep. You are solely responsible for your site's content maintenance and code development. Please refer to the upcoming Blog and Wiki content policy for additional details.

## Blog and Wiki Hosting

**Applications**

The WordPress application will be installed for blogs. MediaWiki (the software behind Wikipedia) will be installed for wikis.

The URL of the blog/wiki will be the subdomain that you submitted for approval to the Web Committee, e.g., https://mysite.fordham.edu.

**Administrative Access**

The person whom you designate as blog/wiki administrative contact will receive the blog/wiki access credentials (login and password).
