# Accessible Excel Spreadsheets

The contrast between the color of the text and the background it is overlaid on should be at least 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 on large text. Color contrast issues are pinged in accessibility reports.

It is important to avoid white text on a white background because it will fail in the contrast ratio area.

Excel has an **Accessibility Checker** under the **Review** tab.

Assistive technologies will be able to navigate Excel documents natively. Screenreaders can be used to hear how documents are scanned.

- Do not change the color of text to hide it on a white background.
- On Mac, you can test using the
**VoiceOver**screen reader tool. - On Windows, you can test using
**Narrator**or an external tool like**JAWS**.
