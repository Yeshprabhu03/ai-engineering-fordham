**Content Producers** - Anyone who will be creating content that will go on the website. They are not necessarily the ones actually creating pages in Terminalfour.

## Privileges in Terminalfour

**Contributors **- Staff trained to update the website using Terminalfour. Their updates will require *Moderator Approval* in order for their changes to go live on the website.

**Moderators** - Staff trained to use Terminalfour and designated as "Approvers" of updates made by Moderators and Contributors.
