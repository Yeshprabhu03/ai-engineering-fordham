Insert Meta Description and Keywords

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is your page’s ranking in search engines like Google, Yahoo, and Bing. Metadata is the descriptive text that appears in search engines.

The **metadata** description should clearly identify what the page is about and should be about 140 characters.

### How to Insert Metadata - For Moderators

- When you create a new page, click the "More" tab
- Click "Metadata"
- Insert metadata in the "Description" field

(This text appears in search engines) - Insert related keywords separated by commas
- Click "Save Changes"

**Contributors** will not see the "More" tab. It is best practice for each area to create a Google spreadsheet on the Shared Drive and list the description for each newly created page. This document should be shared with Moderators in your areas so they can add the meta description to the new pages.

Consider the keywords users might enter into a search engine to find the content and integrate them into the page copy.

Be sure to repeat descriptive keywords throughout the page and include descriptive keywords in the page title.
