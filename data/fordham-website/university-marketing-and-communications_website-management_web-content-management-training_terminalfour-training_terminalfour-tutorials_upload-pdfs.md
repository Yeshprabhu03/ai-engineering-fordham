# Upload PDFs

In order for a PDF to be uploaded and live on the site, it **must be accessible (ADA compliant)**. When a PDF is uploaded, it will go into Workflow for review.

- If the PDF meets accessibility requirements, it will be approved, and you can add it to your page.
- If the PDF does not meet accessibility requirements, it will be rejected, and you will need to resolve the accessibility issues in the PDF.

The **maximum allowed PDF file size is 5 MB**. Please ensure all images are compressed and the total file size is under 5 MB before uploading.
