# Immigration-Related Emergencies & Legal Resources

Fordham University, in its commitment to supporting its community members, has entered into an agreement with external law firms to provide initial no-cost legal consultations to current Fordham students, faculty, and staff facing emergency immigration-related issues, including removal proceedings, visa revocation, and detainment. For students, faculty, and staff who encounter an immigration-related emergency, call Fordham Public Safety immediately at **718-817-2222 (Rose Hill)** or **212-636-6076 (Lincoln Center)**. Public Safety is staffed 24/7, and will connect the caller with external legal resources based on the situation, including a round-the-clock travel emergency hotline as appropriate.
