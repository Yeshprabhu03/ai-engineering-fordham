With Broadway a block to the east and Central Park not much farther, nearly every great thing you can imagine about living in New York is right at your doorstep: museums, restaurants, music, all of it.

In the mid-1950s, Fordham was invited to be part of the Lincoln Square Renewal Project, a new performing arts complex on the city's west side, that would become renowned as the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, home of the Metropolitan Opera and the New York City Ballet. Fordham purchased most of the property from West 60th Street to West 62nd Street between Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues, and in 1961 Fordham's Law School opened.

In September of 1968, while construction progressed on the Leon Lowenstein Building, Fordham began offering classes in the Law School as part of a new college called the Liberal Arts College which was renamed in 1996 to Fordham College at Lincoln Center.

The eight-acre campus spans two city blocks, with a landscaped plaza where you can find a respite from the city without actually leaving it. It’s also home to our Gabelli School of Business, School of Professional and Continuing Studies, Graduate School of Education, Graduate School of Social Service, and School of Law.
