The outdoor sculpture garden on Fordham’s Lincoln Center campus attracts visitors year-round. Set in the cultural heart of Manhattan, across the street from Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, the manicured lawn and vibrant flowers of the garden combine with the beautifully appointed sculptures on display to form an inviting green space.

Open from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. from Monday to Friday and 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday, the plaza-level garden can be accessed along 62nd Street via a staircase on the east side of Fordham’s School of Law or via an elevator outside the entrance to the Lowenstein Center, located on the northwest corner of 60th Street and Columbus Avenue.
