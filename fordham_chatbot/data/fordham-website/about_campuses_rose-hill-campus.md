Our Rose Hill campus, in the north Bronx, is as idyllic as college campuses get: 85 acres featuring Gothic architecture and tree-lined walkways.

There’s even more to it than that, as we’re right across the street from the incredibly lush New York Botanical Garden and the Bronx Zoo. You’ll find Fordham College at Rose Hill, the Gabelli School of Business, the School of Professional and Continuing Studies, and graduate programs in Arts and Sciences, and Religion and Religious Education here.

The campus was established in 1841 as St. John’s College by the Right Rev. John Hughes, Coadjutor-Bishop (later Archbishop) of New York, on old Rose Hill Manor in the village of Fordham, then part of Westchester County. The name Fordham is derived from the Anglo-Saxon words “ford” and “ham,” meaning a wading place or ford by a settlement.

The College’s name was officially changed to Fordham University in 1907.
