## New Marketplace Opens September 3

Fordham has been hard at work making steady improvements in its dining offerings; now we have a dining space worthy of our culinary ambitions. The Marketplace dining area has been completely upgraded, reimagined, and redesigned, with more menu choices to accommodate special preferences and dietary and nutritional needs.

## Breakfast Station

Start the day right with your breakfast of choice. Those who prefer something light and healthy can choose from a selection of cereals, granola, fruit and yogurt; If you need something hearty there will be plenty of eggs, bacon and potatoes and a waffle bar!
