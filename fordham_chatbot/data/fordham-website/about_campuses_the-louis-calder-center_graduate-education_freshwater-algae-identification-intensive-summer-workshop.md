Offered at the Louis Calder Center, Fordham University's Biological Field Station located in Armonk, NY.

Instructed by John Wehr (Fordham University)

### What this course is About

This course focuses on algal identification, with a strong emphasis on the ecology and diversity of algae in freshwater habitats, and introduces the use of algae to assess water quality.

### Our Location

We are located in Westchester County NY. The station has a spring-fed lake and is a short distance from a diverse range of aquatic habitats. We have an excellent library of taxonomic keys, facilities for imaging specimens, as well as the boats and a wide array of field and laboratory gear for collecting and quantifying freshwater phytoplankton and periphyton. Housing on site will be available on a first-come-first-served basis, and can be requested at the time of registration.

### What We Will Do

- Collect and study members of all freshwater algal groups, from cyanobacteria through greens, euglenophytes, dinoflagellates, chrysophytes, diatoms, red algae, and plant-like members.
- Gain familiarity proficiency using modern taxonomic keys.
- Learn the features that distinguish the freshwater algal phyla and genera, and gain familiarity with the diagnostic features that are used to identify members of the major groups.
- Create a database of high-resolution algal images and voucher specimens that can be used in future studies.

### Activities and Projects

- A detailed habitat-based survey of benthic and planktonic algae at the meso-eutrophic lake located on the field station property;
- Comparison of algal floras and their ecological factors across a diversity of aquatic habitats in the local area, which encompasses numerous lakes, ponds, marshes, streams, and rivers;
- A detailed study of a specific group or genus of algae in each student’s area of specialization or interest.
- Algae Bio-Blitz: a 24-hour hunt and competition to find the most biodiversity!
