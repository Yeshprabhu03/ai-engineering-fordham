# Research at Calder Center

Calder Center research faculty and scientists from other research institutions direct a diversity of research programs at the station. Fordham University's partnerships with the [Wildlife Conservation Society](http://www.wcs.org/) and the [New York Botanical Garden](http://www.nybg.org/) foster collaboration between Calder Center researchers and scientists at these institutions.

Our research includes work on ecosystem responses to loss of eastern hemlock due to exotic insects and climate change, ecology and epidemiology of vector-borne diseases, avian population dynamics, urban wildlife ecology, behavioral and biochemical adaptations of mammals to extreme environments, the role of ectomycorrhizal fungi in forest soils and their responses to control burning and wildfire, and the role of benthic algae in stream food webs.

[Graduate](/about/campuses/the-louis-calder-center/graduate-education/) and
[undergraduate](/about/campuses/the-louis-calder-center/undergraduate-education/) students play an active and central part in all aspects of the research conducted at the Calder Center.
