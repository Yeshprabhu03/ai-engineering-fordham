# Calder Center Opportunities for Visiting Scientists

For more than 40 years the Calder Center has been providing educational and research opportunities for students and faculty who wish to study organisms and environmental processes. Our preserve is one of the few nationally-recognized field stations in close proximity to New York City, with a relatively undisturbed forest, old fields and aquatic habitats. We have a variety of terrestrial and aquatic communities available for study, as well as extensive laboratory facilities, classrooms, ecological library, field vehicles, and an instructional laboratory for field courses and independent research.

Our station collects continuous records of meteorological, aquatic, environmental, and aerial pollen monitoring data that may be applied to ongoing research studies. The LCC is part of the multi-institutional Urban-Rural Gradient study, which has been examining the effects of urbanization on atmospheric deposition and forest ecosystems. We maintain large experimental aquatic mesocosms (5400 L each) that can be used for experimental studies on lake food webs, and large herbivore exclosures which are being used to evaluate the long-term effects of deer grazing on vegetation composition and soil processes. The Calder Center is also the site of the longest running study of deer tick populations and Lyme disease in the country.

There are many habitats, activities, and facilities that may be useful for a researcher or teacher in your department. We also a have a limited number of guest rooms for overnight users and modest User Fees.

If you are interested in using the Calder Center for a scientific conference, as a teaching resource, or in your research, feel free to contact us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e281838e86879081878c968790a2848d90868a838fcc878697).
