# Undergraduate Education at the Calder Center

The goal of the educational programs at the LCC is to provide university students opportunities to learn about the natural world through hands-on experience in the field. Students are instructed in methods and conduct scientific research in relatively undisturbed ecosystems, yet near an urban center. The station also provides the first opportunities for many urban students to examine the natural world first hand. The field station has a long record of providing undergraduate students close collaborations with Fordham faculty members and opportunities to conduct their experimental studies to test ecological theory and learn about impacts of human disturbance on natural systems.

The LCC serves as a focal point for undergraduate education in several areas:

- Field Trips for undergraduate courses
- Calder Summer Undergraduate Research (CSUR)
- Honors theses and research tutorials
