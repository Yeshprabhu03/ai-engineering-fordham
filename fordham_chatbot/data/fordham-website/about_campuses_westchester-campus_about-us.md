# About Our Westchester Campus

The Fordham Westchester campus is located in a three-story, state-of-the-art building on 32 landscaped acres in West Harrison, NY. This location is home to the Westchester branches of Fordham’s Gabelli School of Business, Graduate School of Education, Graduate School of Social Service, and School of Professional and Continuing Studies.

Fordham Westchester offers residents of Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, and Fairfield counties class schedules designed for people with busy lives. The campus hosts adult undergraduate and graduate degree programs and classes for personal enrichment. Our programs help you earn the credentials to start a new career or strengthen an existing one.

Small class sizes and the opportunity to interact with professors and fellow students are central components of academic life at Fordham, and the format and schedule of classes are developed with the needs of the adult learner in mind (ranging from 15-week on-site classes in the day, evening, and week-end intensives to on-line classes). Academic advising and career counseling are available on an ongoing basis in order to ensure that each student achieves his or her academic and professional goals.
