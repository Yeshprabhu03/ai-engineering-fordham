## Delegate Portal

Fordham University makes provisions for **students to allow third parties to view specific information on the Fordham portal** through a process called "delegate access." Students must use this process to allow third parties (including parents, guardians, family members, and sponsors) to communicate with Academic Records and Enrollment Group staff about the student's education record. This access can be granted or revoked at any time.
