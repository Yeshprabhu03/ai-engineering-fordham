# Duplicate Diplomas

Duplicate diplomas are ordered twice a year **(January and July)**. Once ordered, it takes up to eight weeks to be processed. Please complete the [Duplicate Diploma Form](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/academic-records/pdfs/Duplicate-Diploma-Form.pdf), and return it along with payment to the address indicated on the form.

Note: Fordham University provides graduates from the Class of 2020 and beyond with complimentary [Certified Electronic Diplomas and Certificates](https://ediploma.fordham.edu/) (CeDiploma/CeCertificate).

Please note: if you have a financial obligation to the University, your duplicate diploma request cannot be honored. In instances where a diploma is returned as undeliverable, Fordham University will retain the student's diploma for a period of 6 full academic years from the date of graduation. Thereafter, a duplicate diploma must be ordered and the associated fee paid.

**Payment**

Effective July 1, 2024, the fee for a duplicate diploma is $78 (check or money order payable to Fordham University, credit cards not accepted).

**Mailing Diploma**

The duplicate diploma fee includes mailing of the diploma. Diplomas are sent through the United States Postal Service (USPS). It is recommended that diplomas NOT be mailed to P.O. boxes or international addresses. An additional charge of $26 applies if the request is to mail the diploma to an international address.

Please note, if you choose to have your diploma mailed internationally and it arrives damaged or not received, you will be obligated to pay the duplicate diploma order fee if requesting another diploma.

**Pick up service is not available at this time.**
