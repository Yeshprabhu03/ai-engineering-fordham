- Be a resident of New York State (that is, you must have lived in the state for at least one year prior to the first term for which you are seeking payment)

## New York State TAP One-time Waiver and C- Average Waiver

Full time students who are New York State (NYS) residents and have applied for the NYS TAP (Tuition Assistance Program) will receive an award notice from NYS TAP. The award must be certified by Fordham each semester based on current regulatory and academic requirements after the final date to drop a course.

Among the requirements is the obligation of the student to maintain New York State's definition of "good academic standing" which has two components:

**Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP)**: a requirement that students accumulate a specific number of credits and achieve a specified cumulative grade point average each semester depending on the number of NYS award payments the student has received.**Pursuit of Program (POP)**: defined as receiving a passing or failing grade (on a A-F grading scale) in a certain percentage of courses each semester depending on the number of NYS awards the student has received.

## Good Academic Standing Waiver

If a student becomes ineligible for a TAP award due to the loss of good academic standing, s/he may apply for a TAP one-time waiver under exceptional or unexpected circumstances. In certain cases, the requirements regarding POP or SAP may be waived once during their undergraduate career.

### C Average Waiver

The C average Waiver is intended for students who may have difficulty maintaining an average of C (2.0) or more while receiving NYS TAP. The C average waiver is separate from the one-time good academic standing waiver and may be granted more than once if circumstances warrant.

Waivers are based on an undue hardship that has affected the student’s ability to maintain good academic standing during any semester. A waiver will not be granted automatically; it must originate with the student and is intended only to accommodate extraordinary or unusual cases. Waivers are based on documented evidence of:

- A death or illness in the student’s family
- Other extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the student
- Personal illness involving either hospitalization or extended home confinement

**To apply for a waiver the student would need to request the waiver in writing to his/her dean/advisor explaining the circumstances surrounding their situation and the path to resolution. If the dean/advisor supports the waiver request they would forward their email to review team for approval. **

The waiver is not automatic and is intended only to accommodate extenuating circumstances or unusual cases. The waiver is only applicable when there is a reasonable expectation that the student will meet future requirements. Specific details regarding the extenuating circumstances need to be reported, such as specific events and dates, and appropriate documentation is required.

*Please note that applying for a TAP waiver is not a guarantee that you will be approved. The waiver will be granted only when there is a reasonable expectation that the student will meet future requirements. *

### Waiver of 12 Credit Program Applicability

For students who are unable to meet the minimum 12 credits toward their degree program (as a result of AP courses taken in high school, having transferred into the institution, encountering obstacles posed by course sequence requirements, or changing majors) they may also request a waiver.

As with the above waivers they must submit a request in writing to their dean/advisor including the reason why they cannot meet the minimum 12 credit requirement. If the request is supported the Dean/Advisor will forward the petition to the waiver review team for final approval. This request must include a detailed path toward degree completion while maintaining the minimum number of credit hours required for full-time study status toward the approved program of study.
