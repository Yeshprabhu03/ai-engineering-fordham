# Course Registration Waitlist Instructions

## Registering for Courses Using Waitlists

Some courses at the University have a waitlist available, which enables students to be notified if a seat opens up in a course and be given an opportunity to register for it. These instructions cover how to use this waitlist functionality for courses that have a waitlist.

### How do I know what courses are closed?

When searching for courses in the [fordham.edu](http://fordham.edu/) portal, please look at the "Status" column the course will have a "FULL!" notation. Please note, waitlist courses will appear as open, but are NOT; due to the waitlist automation process offering, the seat available will be offered to the next student on the waitlist.

### How do I get into a waitlist course?

After some courses reach capacity, and close to new registrants, students may have an option to place themselves on a waitlist. The waitlist is an automated process with random selection based on seniority—e.g. third year and fourth year students are given priority. The waitlist ends two weeks prior to the start of each semester. If you are offered a seat, you must drop any potential conflict and be sure that there is room for the waitlisted course credit.

### If I get selected from the waitlist, how much time do I have to register?

An email notification will be sent to your fordham.edu email account; once notified, you will have a deadline of 48 hours to register for the course. It is important that you check your Fordham email frequently, if you are on a waitlist for any class. Once the 48 hour deadline to register for the seat has passed, the seat will be offered to the next student on the waitlist and you will lose the offer. If you lose the seat, you must drop the waitlisted course and re-register yourself for the waitlist course again.

### When does the waitlist process end?

The waitlist ends two weeks prior to the start of each semester.

### How do course restrictions work for waitlisting?

Restrictions work the same as regular registration. Students must meet all of the course pre-requisites, co-requisites and restrictions in order to sign-up a waitlist.

### Can students get on the waitlist for more than one section of the same course?

Yes. Students can waitlist themselves on more than one section of the same course.

### Is there a way for students to see their position on the waitlist?

No, a student position on the waitlist is not displayed.

### Can students get on a waitlist for a class that has a time conflict with another course?

Yes, the waitlist is not actual registration. Students are able to waitlist for sections that have day/time conflicts with. However, once a student is selected from the waitlist they must drop any potential conflict and be sure that there is room for the waitlisted course credit.

### If a student has a hold on their account, can they add to a waitlist?

No. The same restrictions apply to the waitlist that apply to registering for a course. Any holds have to be resolved in order to waitlist and register for courses.
