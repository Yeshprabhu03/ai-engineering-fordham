# Delegate Portal

## Delegate Access to your Education Record/Student Account

The University makes provisions for students to allow third parties to view specific information on the Fordham portal through a process called "delegate access." Students must use this process to allow third parties (including parents, guardians, family members, and sponsors) to communicate with Enrollment Group staff about the student's education record. This access can be granted or revoked at any time.

We use Multi-Factor Authentication and the alternative method of a verbal passphrase in order to authenticate delegates and confirm the student has given permission to share information.

What is a Delegate?

A Delegate is a person who is designated by a student to access certain portions of their online account (such as to upload financial documents on their behalf), via a delegate portal, and discuss the student's education record with a member of Academic Records and Student Financial Services (and other divisions of Fordham's [Enrollment Group](/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/enrollment-group/)) in person, on the phone, or through email.

Why do I need to designate a Delegate?

We are taking advantage of new technology to enhance the protection of your privacy. This new process will provide a faster, more secure service for you and your delegates.

**Only parties designated as delegates can discuss your education record with Enrollment Group staff and will be asked to confirm their identity via multi-factor authentication or use of a passphrase.**

Who can be granted Delegate Access?

Anyone with a valid email address and cell phone number can be granted Delegate Access including parents, guardians, employers, or anyone else the student deems appropriate. The student has complete control over who has access, what information the delegate user has access to, and the length of time for which the delegate has access.

What information can a Delegate access?

#### Via the Delegate Portal

Academic Information (for enrolled students)

Delegates may have access to academic information such as the student's class schedule.

Financial Document Upload (for applicants, admitted students, and enrolled students)

Delegates can upload documents requested by the Office of Student Financial Services.

#### Via Other Self-Service Portals

Student Financials/Bill Pay (separate login required)

Includes access to the account balance, summary of current charges/payments, review of past activity, and view/print current and prior bills.

[Monthly Payment Plan/NelNet](https://www.fordham.edu/mpp) (separate login required)

Enrollment monthly payment plans.

#### Via Phone or In-Person with an Enrollment Group representative

A representative from the Enrollment Group may be able to share those items for which the student has granted access to the Delegate, only after authenticating the caller/visitor using the University's multi-factor authentication system or a passphrase.

**Students may revoke access at any time.**

What are the methods of delegate authentication?

Delegate access provides designated delegates two methods of authentication when communicating with staff from the [Enrollment Group](/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/enrollment-group/) in situations such as a phone call or in-person visit:

- Multi-Factor Authentication application (MFA): currently required for all members of the University community. When a delegate is invited to create an account by their student(s), the process prompts for signing up for MFA and setting up the MFA application on a smartphone.
[Passphrase](#anchor-7-a): during the process of granting delegate access, a student assigns a delegate a passphrase, which is a unique code word or short phrase. The student is responsible for remembering and communicating the passphrase to the delegate. The delegate can see their passphrase once logged into the Delegate Portal. A passphrase cannot be changed by the delegate and must be provided on request if MFA authentication is not available.

What is the difference between a passphrase and a password?

Passphrase

During the process of granting delegate access, a student assigns a delegate a passphrase, which is a unique code word or short phrase. The student is responsible for remembering and communicating the passphrase to the delegate. The delegate can see their passphrase once logged into the Delegate Portal. A passphrase cannot be changed by the delegate and must be provided on request if MFA authentication is not available.

#### Password

As part of creating their delegate account, the delegate must create a password that is associated with their Fordham delegate username. This password, along with the delegate username, is needed for the delegate to access the delegate portal.

I forgot my delegate username. How do I retrieve it?

You may use your mobile phone number used in the account creation to retrieve your delegate username by going to [https://claim.fordham.edu/username/](https://claim.fordham.edu/username/).
