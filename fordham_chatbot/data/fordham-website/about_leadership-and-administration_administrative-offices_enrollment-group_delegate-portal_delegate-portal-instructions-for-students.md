# Delegate Portal Instructions for Students

## Instructions for Students

Overview

As a student, you can add someone as a delegate to review financial and academic topics with members of the Enrollment Group. You can also customize access for your delegates to upload financial documents, see class schedules, view holds, etc. **Students have complete control over who has access, what information the delegate user may view or discuss, and the length of time for which the delegate has access.**

## Add a Delegate

- On the Fordham portal, go to My Pages | Students.
- Click on My Account.
- Expand Manage Delegates and click Manage Delegates.

- Enter information for the delegate, including name, relationship, email, and mobile phone.
- Select the items that you want to give them portal or discussion access.
- Assign a unique passphrase that they can use when calling the University.
- Check the acknowledgement.
- Click Submit.

If your delegate is not part of the Fordham community and does not have a @fordham.edu account, they will receive an email from [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#91e1f0e2e2fffee5f8f7e8d1f7fee3f5f9f0fcbff4f5e4) directing them to set up their account.
