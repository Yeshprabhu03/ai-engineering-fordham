# BRICS Studies

We are proud to launch the inaugural studies of the Bronx Research Institute for Community Solutions (BRICS). We recognize that the most sustainable solutions arise when community members and scholars work together as equals, building on the community's strengths. Through co-learning and co-creation, we elevate these strengths, envisioning a future shaped by collective insight and actionable strategies.
