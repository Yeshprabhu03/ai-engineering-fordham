# Evaluating the Long-Term Impact of the Read Alliance Program

This study seeks to evaluate the long-term impact of Read Alliance’s programming on Teen Leaders, young students (READers), and school communities. Through a mixed-methods research approach, we will collect and analyze qualitative and quantitative data to assess how participation in Read Alliance influences Teen Leaders' academic and career trajectories, enhances early literacy outcomes for young students, and influences student growth as observed by teachers and school leaders/admin. We will conduct interviews and surveys with multiple stakeholders, including current and former Teen Leaders, families, and school administrators, to understand their experiences and perspectives. The study will explore how Read Alliance fosters leadership development, college and career readiness, and educational equity. Additionally, we will examine the ways families and educators perceive the program’s impact on students' academic confidence and success. Findings will inform program improvements and demonstrate the value of Read Alliance’s model in advancing literacy and youth workforce development.
