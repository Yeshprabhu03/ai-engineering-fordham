# Community-Engaged Clinical Ethics at Montefiore Medical Center

This collaborative project with Montefiore Einstein’s Center for Bioethics aims to ensure that hospital ethics consultation and mediation practices are informed by the needs and values of the Bronx community. Montefiore’s Center for Bioethics is a national leader in clinical ethics consultation. The Bronx is one of the most racially and ethnically diverse counties in the nation, while also the lowest ranking county in the state for health factors and health outcomes. Standard practices in clinical ethics consultation may not fit the profile of this unique community. Through community-drive initiatives, this project will empower Bronx residents in complex medical contexts and enable the Center for Bioethics to facilitate clinical decision-making that meets community needs.
