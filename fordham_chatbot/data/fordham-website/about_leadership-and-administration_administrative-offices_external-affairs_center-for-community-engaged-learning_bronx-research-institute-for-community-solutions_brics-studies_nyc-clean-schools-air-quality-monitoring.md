# NYC Clean Schools Air Quality Monitoring

The overall objective of this research project is to identify the impact of traffic-related air pollution on educational outcomes for New York City students. In partnership with researchers and two other community-based organizations in the city, we have installed low-cost air quality monitors inside and outside of 20 high schools across the city, along with weather stations at each school. We also partnered with teachers and students at the schools to conduct weekly building surveys to assess indoor conditions and identify defensive behaviors (such as the use of air filters), which is the focus of this proposed action. These monitors and building surveys allow us to identify pollution at each school, understand how the ambient traffic-related pollution corresponds to indoor conditions, and eventually quantify the impact on resulting academic performance. This work will provide high-resolution, actionable data that NYCLU can use in its efforts to reduce transportation-related pollution near schools.
