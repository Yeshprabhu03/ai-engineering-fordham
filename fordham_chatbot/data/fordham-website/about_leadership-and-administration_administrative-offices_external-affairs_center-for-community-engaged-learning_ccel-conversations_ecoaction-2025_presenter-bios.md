Performances have been supported by the [ NYC Emergency Management](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DARPTgJyF_u/) (as part of National Disaster Prevention Month), FloodNet, Chhaya CDC, Street Works Climate Art Festival, Huntington Art Works, and Culture Push, so all performances are free and audiences left with bellies full of (oat milk) chai, doubles, flood alarms, headlamps, and calls to action about legalizing basement apartments.
