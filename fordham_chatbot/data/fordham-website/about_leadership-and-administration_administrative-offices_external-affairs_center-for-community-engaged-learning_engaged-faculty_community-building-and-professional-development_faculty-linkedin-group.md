# Faculty Linkedin Group

In order to promote diverse avenues for engagement, CCEL recently launched a faculty LinkedIn group. In this space, we aim to facilitate community among faculty members committed to community engaged learning. We invite faculty to engage with us to share knowledge, news, and opportunities.
