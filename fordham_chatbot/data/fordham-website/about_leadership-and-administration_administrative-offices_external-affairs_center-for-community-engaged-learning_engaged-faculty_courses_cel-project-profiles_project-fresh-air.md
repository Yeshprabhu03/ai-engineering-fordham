**Process**

The FRESH Air team, which includes Fordham faculty members Steve Holler (Physics), Usha Sankar (Biological Sciences) and Marc Conte (Economics), as well as undergraduates, and middle and high school educators, have traveled to many schools throughout the city, with a focus on Manhattan and the Bronx, to install sensors and speak to K-12 students about the project, now expanding into Queens and Brooklyn ,to both obtain more comprehensive data and expand outreach.

**Location**

Bronx, Manhattan, expanding throughout New York City
