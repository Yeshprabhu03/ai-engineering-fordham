# Action 3: Defend the Truth

- Host a
**biannual international sustainability conference**to acquaint the University community with best practices and cutting-edge research toward solution-building. This conference will bring together representatives from the 68 colleges and universities that began action planning with Fordham. - Create a set of
**environmental sustainability course modules**, with resources, lesson plans, guest speakers, and activities that can be modified to fit into any undergraduate course, and connect that course and its areas of inquiry with the pressing imperatives of environmental justice and ecology. - Partner with other colleges and universities, as well as with community and industry partners, to undertake
**broad STEM research projects**including but not limited to fieldwork, soil and air quality analyses, data analysis, policy recommendations, and assessments of climate change. - Create and host a set of sustainability
**immersion or study-away experiences**in partnership with the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities network as well as our international college and university partners to offer one-to-two-week or semester-long sustainability experiences in NYC and at partner sites using the University’s Global Outreach program infrastructure and network. - In partnership with the Wildlife Conservation Society, build a
**student ambassador program**centered on sustainability and advocacy. - Create and mobilize
**undergraduate interdisciplinary tracks and micro-credentialing opportunities**that offer the communications, STEM, and related skills necessary to advance in vocational and green job sectors.

“When we work to defend and advance a fact-based reality, the view of the regenerative future we want, and the path we will travel to get there, will come more sharply into focus.”
