# Post Secondary Pathways (P.S.P.)

The Post-Secondary Pathways (PSP) program builds on the strengths, talents, and aspirations of local youth and families to expand access to college, career, and lifelong learning. Through tutoring, mentoring, and collaborative workshops, PSP connects K-12 students with Fordham students and faculty to explore pathways to higher education and civic leadership.

The program offers hands-on experiences, from interactive campus tours to family sessions focused on wellness, financial literacy, and college readiness. Centered on partnership, PSP works alongside schools, nonprofits, and families to nurture the skills, confidence, and community connections that help young people thrive beyond high school.
