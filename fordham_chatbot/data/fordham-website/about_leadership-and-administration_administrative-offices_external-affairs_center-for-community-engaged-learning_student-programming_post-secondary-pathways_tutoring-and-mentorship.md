# Tutoring and Mentorship

The Post-Secondary Pathway Program seeks to promote student success and academic excellence in Fordham undergraduates by creating and promoting opportunities for our students to get hands-on experiences in community-based work in the context of tutoring/mentorship opportunities. Furthermore, we strive to move Fordham forward through solid collaborations with the Bronx community, Lincoln Square, and Upper Manhattan and to be of value to partner organizations in the solutions and initiatives they are crafting.

As a Jesuit institution of higher education, we believe that advancing post-secondary pathways and enhancing college readiness must be a cornerstone of the work we do in the Center for Community Engaged Learning, making a transformative impact to our surrounding communities.

Each semester, Fordham undergraduate students partner with middle and high school student groups to support their success by facilitating the college application process, creating programs to build skills, and supporting their identity and development in pursuit of their career exploration and college education.
