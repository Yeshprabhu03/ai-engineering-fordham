The Strategic Sourcing and Office Services Department plays a vital role in optimizing Fordham's procurement activities, ensuring that resources are acquired efficiently and effectively. We are committed to providing comprehensive support across a range of critical functions, including:

**Preferred Suppliers:**

We cultivate and maintain strong relationships with our vendors, ensuring they align with the University's values and standards. This includes vendor selection, performance monitoring, and fostering collaborative partnerships.

**Vendor Management****:**

Suppliers can register and maintain their own profiles directly through a user-friendly, cloud-based, self-service portal. Our supplier portal provides a centralized, intelligent platform to manage our entire relationship with suppliers, moving beyond transactional interactions to strategic partnerships.

**Procurement Operations:**

We streamline procurement processes, implementing best practices to maximize efficiency and minimize costs. This encompasses managing purchase orders, processing invoices, Corporate Card services and ensuring compliance with University policies.

**Strategic Sourcing:**

We employ a data-driven approach to identify opportunities for cost savings and value enhancement. This involves conducting market research, analyzing spending patterns, administering the Request for Proposal (RFP) process and negotiating favorable contracts to secure the best possible outcomes for the University.

**Contract Management:**

We oversee the entire contract lifecycle, from drafting and negotiation to execution and management. We ensure that all contracts comply with legal and regulatory requirements, protecting the University's interests.

**Office Services:**

We provide essential office services that support the day-to-day operational needs of the university.

Our goal is to serve as a strategic partner to the University community, providing expert guidance and support to ensure that procurement activities contribute to the institution's overall success. We are dedicated to promoting transparency, accountability, and value in all our operations.
