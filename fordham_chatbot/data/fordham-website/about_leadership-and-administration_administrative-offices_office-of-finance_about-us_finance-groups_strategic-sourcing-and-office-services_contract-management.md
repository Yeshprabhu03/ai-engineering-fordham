## Overview

**Fordham University Contracting Process**

At Fordham University, we are committed to making our contracting process for goods and services as efficient and compliant as possible. We believe in departmental ownership of their contracts, empowering our departments to take full responsibility for understanding Fordham’s policies and procedures for contracting with vendors, including purchasing, payment, and vendor relations.

**Oversight and System**

Contracting at Fordham is overseen by the Office of Strategic Sourcing and Office Services.

Jaggaer (FINCON) is Fordham’s contract management solution. Jaggaer streamlines the entire process, handling various levels of review, approval, and signatures required for contracts, and serves as a repository for executed contracts.

To ensure proper risk mitigation and asset protection, the Office of Strategic Sourcing and Office Services collaborates with various departments, including:

- The Office of General Counsel

- The Office of Risk Management

- The Office of Information Technology

- The Office of Finance

**Before You Make a Purchase Commitment**

Before you commit to any purchase, every contract manager should follow these steps:

- First, determine if the product or service you need is available from a University Preferred Supplier. If the product or service is available from a Preferred Supplier, then no additional agreements are required. Simply issue a Purchase Order to the supplier from FINBUY and proceed.
- Some Preferred Suppliers require a signed Statement of Work (SOW). The SOW is specific to the goods or services of the individual purchase and does not impact the terms of the preferred supplier agreement.
- If a non-preferred supplier is necessary for a product or service, the department should check with Strategic Sourcing to determine if an existing contract is in place with the supplier. If an existing agreement is applicable, it will govern the purchase.
- If no contract exists with the desired vendor, the department will request a new contract be initiated, following the
[University Contracting Process](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/office-of-finance/pdfs/Fordham-University-Contract-Basics.pdf).
