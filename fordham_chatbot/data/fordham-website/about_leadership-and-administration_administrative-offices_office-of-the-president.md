“If we work ever harder, ever smarter, Fordham will continue to rise to new heights. We will achieve (as we say here) MAGIS. It’s a Latin word that simply means “more,” but to us it means the constant striving to do better – to have raging ambition – not for ourselves – but for the mission of God.”

— Tania Tetlow
