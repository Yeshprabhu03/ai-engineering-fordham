# About the Office of the Provost

The Office of the Provost is responsible for the growth and enrichment of the academic life of Fordham University. In consultation with the faculty and under the auspices of the President and the Board of Trustees, we promote the academic mission of the University's eight colleges and schools.

We support all faculty members and oversee Fordham's [research centers and institutes](/academics/centers-and-institutes/) and administer all special academic offices, including the [University Library System](/resources/libraries/), [Fordham University Press](https://www.fordhampress.com/), and [WFUV](http://www.wfuv.org/) (90.7 FM). Academic financial planning and analysis, assessment, and the integration of the University mission are central to all aspects of our work.
