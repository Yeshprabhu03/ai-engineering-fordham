# NC-SARA Student Complaint Process

## Out-of-State Complaints Procedures for Online Students

**State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement - SARA**

Fordham University is a member of the National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements (NC-SARA) and follows the complaint resolution policies and procedures outlined within the [SARA Policy Manual](https://nc-sara.org/sara-policy-manual) and summarized here: [https://nc-sara.org/sara-student-complaints-0/ ](https://nc-sara.org/sara-student-complaints-0/)

SARA consumer protection provisions require the institution’s home state, through its SARA State Portal Entity, to investigate and resolve allegations of dishonest or fraudulent activity by the state’s SARA-participating institutions, including the provision of false or misleading information.

Student complaints related to consumer protection laws, as outlined in the terms and conditions of the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA), must first be filed with the institution to seek resolution. This means that for students residing outside New York who are enrolled in Fordham University distance education programs, consumer protection complaints are addressed through New York State (the University’s home state) rather than through the student’s own state of residence.

**Procedure for Filing SARA-related Consumer Complaints (for Students or Prospective Students Residing Outside NY)**

Fordham University is committed to investigating consumer protection concerns raised by students or prospective students in distance learning courses and/or programs taken outside of New York State, including, but not limited to, the truthfulness of advertising and the accuracy of data related to course offerings, job placements, tuition, fees, and financial aid.

**File a complaint through Fordham University’s internal complaint process.**

Students or prospective students may submit their complaint through Fordham University’s internal procedures for investigation and resolution. Complaints may be submitted through the process described here: [https://www.fordham.edu/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/office-of-the-provost/about-us/contact-us/internal-complaint-process/](/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/office-of-the-provost/about-us/contact-us/internal-complaint-process/)

Following Fordham’s process, students or prospective students may appeal the institutional decision to the **New York State Education Department (SARA State Portal Entity)**.

Students who are not satisfied with the outcome of Fordham University’s internal resolution may appeal the complaint to the New York State Education Department (NYSED) within two years of the incident giving rise to the complaint.

Since California is not an NC-SARA member, students can direct complaints to the [California Department of Consumer Affairs](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dca.ca.gov%2Fconsumers%2Fcomplaints%2Foos_students.shtml&data=04%7C01%7Ckmockler%40mercy.edu%7C3578207dde814bcc5a4008d90982c1a3%7C88404777f24b4e1cada1bde9cda22754%7C0%7C0%7C637551279466409289%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=%2BbyM9WhedGKRiwdbtzFkTxYhfSOUH16EWHSFoLEUOOg%3D&reserved=0).

### NC-SARA Licensure Notifications

Any institution operating under SARA policies that offers courses or programs potentially leading to professional licensure must inform all students, applicants, and potential students who have contacted the institution about the course or program whether successful completion of such offerings will meet state licensing requirements.

**Professional Licensure: What You Need to Know**

**What Is Professional Licensure?**

Some careers—such as teaching, nursing, psychology, and social work—require official licensure before you can work in the field. Students often pursue college degrees to prepare for these licensed professions, which are overseen by state or governmental agencies. These agencies set professional standards and grant authorization to practice only to those who meet the established requirements. This process, known as professional licensure, helps ensure that individuals entering these professions are well-trained and capable of providing safe and competent services.

**Check Before You Enroll**

If you’re taking an online or distance education program to prepare for a licensed career, ensure that the program meets the requirements in the state where you plan to work. Schools that participate in SARA or federal financial aid programs must tell you if their programs meet those requirements.

**SARA’s Role**

SARA doesn’t approve programs for state licensing boards. Instead, it requires schools to clearly inform students whether a program will or will not meet the licensure requirements where the student resides.

- Any school operating under SARA policies must keep students, applicants, and prospective students informed if completing a program will meet state licensing requirements.
