# University Core Revision

## About Fordham’s Core Curriculum

At its foundation, Fordham’s core curriculum is a statement of our educational values and a reflection of our Jesuit mission to prepare students for responsible leadership and service in a global society. The core, which assures that every student’s undergraduate education is anchored in the liberal arts, contributes to the distinctive nature of a Fordham education. Our commitment to the core also entails the responsibility of reviewing and renewing this curricula to prepare today’s students for tomorrow’s world.

## Reimagining Fordham’s Core

Our reconceptualization of the core focuses on the power of interdisciplinary, collaborative learning experiences to educate students to navigate a diverse society where they can bring intelligence, creativity, and compassion to address local and global problems.

The core revision process, rooted in our Jesuit tradition and the opportunities of our New York City location, is designed to cultivate a spirit of innovation and collaboration among faculty of all undergraduate schools.
