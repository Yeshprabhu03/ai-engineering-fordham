**Academic Freedom**

Fordham is committed to the free and unhampered pursuit of truth throughout its teaching and research endeavors. The University will protect any member of the instructional staff, whether tenured or non-tenured, against pressures and influences from within and without the University which would restrict the exercise of academic freedom. (University Statutes: [Article Four; Chapter Four](https://www.fordham.edu/about/leadership-and-administration/board-of-trustees/university-statutes/article-four-policies-and-procedures-for-faculty/chapter-four-academic-freedom/) and [Appendix 1](https://www.fordham.edu/about/leadership-and-administration/board-of-trustees/university-statutes/appendix-1-academic-freedom-and-tenure/))

** Core Curriculum**The Core Curriculum, recently revised by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, is central to its larger mission and identity as a university in the Catholic and Jesuit traditions preparing students for responsible leadership in a global society.
