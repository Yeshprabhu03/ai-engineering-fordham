# Accreditation 101

As Fordham prepares for its [Middle States Reaccreditation](/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/office-of-the-provost/about-us/our-work/middle-states-accreditation/), here is some information about how accreditation impacts the education colleges and universities provide.

**What is accreditation?**

Accreditation is a process by which colleges and universities are evaluated by an independent accrediting body to ensure they meet specific educational quality standards. It’s similar to a performance evaluation you might have at work or being graded on your performance in a course.

**Who accredits colleges and universities?**

Colleges and universities are accredited by Independent accrediting agencies, recognized by the U.S. Department of Education or Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA).

Fordham is accredited by [The Middle States Commission on Higher Education](https://www.msche.org/) who accredit over 500 institutions including most private and public colleges and universities in the mid-Atlantic region including Columbia, NYU, Princeton, Cornell, Carnegie Mellon, and John Hopkins.

**How is a school accredited?**

Colleges and universities undergo a rigorous review process, including self-assessment, peer review, and meeting specific academic and institutional standards.

At Fordham, reaccreditation begins with a self-assessment called a [self-study](/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/office-of-the-provost/about-us/our-work/middle-states-accreditation/2025-self-study/) that is led by a [steering committee](/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/office-of-the-provost/about-us/our-work/middle-states-accreditation/2025-self-study/leadership-and-collaboration/) and a variety of [working groups and teams](/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/office-of-the-provost/about-us/our-work/middle-states-accreditation/2025-self-study/leadership-and-collaboration/working-groups-and-teams/) who are responsible for demonstrating how Fordham has met MSCHE standards across [institutional priority areas](/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/office-of-the-provost/about-us/our-work/middle-states-accreditation/2025-self-study/institutional-priorities/).

It culminates in a [site visit by an MSCHE Evaluation Team](/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/office-of-the-provost/about-us/our-work/middle-states-accreditation/peer-review-visit-/) made up of peer evaluators who are higher education professionals at other institutions.

**Why is accreditation important?**

Accreditation assures students and employers that a college or university provides a quality education, but it is also important because:

- Federal financial aid is only available to students attending accredited institutions.
- Accredited schools typically accept credits only from other accredited institutions.
- Employers often prefer degrees from accredited institutions, as they demonstrate a standardized quality of education.
