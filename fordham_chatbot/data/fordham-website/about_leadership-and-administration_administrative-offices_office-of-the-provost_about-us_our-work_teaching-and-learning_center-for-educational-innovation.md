# Center for Educational Innovation

## About the Center

The Center for Educational Innovation is Fordham’s home for pedagogy. Launched in Fall 2025, we aim to support instructors across the university in developing high-quality, innovative, and inclusive teaching practices, leveraging the Ignatian Pedagogical Paradigm to foster impactful and supportive learning experiences for all of our students.

The Center for Educational Innovation provides faculty with the space and opportunity to focus on their teaching practice, individually and within a community of practice. Each of our programs, services, and initiatives is designed to cultivate experimentation and curiosity about the best of teaching and learning. Wherever you are in your teaching, we will support you.
