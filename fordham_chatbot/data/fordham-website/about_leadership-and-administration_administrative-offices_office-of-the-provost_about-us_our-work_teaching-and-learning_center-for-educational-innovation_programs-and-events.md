Learning outcomes, assignment designs, and evaluation approaches often only focus on the content knowledge and skills we want our students to gain. But there are equally important human capacities that merit overt inclusion in our course design. Meta-skills - such as creative problem-solving, openness to diverse perspectives, and teamwork - are higher order skills and abilities that promote adaptability and responsiveness to new experiences. In this session, we’ll explore how to bring meta-skills into our teaching, how to design learning experiences for meta-skills, and how to evaluate them in student work.
