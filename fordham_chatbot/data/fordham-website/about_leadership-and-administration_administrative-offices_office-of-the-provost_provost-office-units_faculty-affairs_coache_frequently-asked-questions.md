# COACHE Frequently Asked Questions

The

[Collaborative on Academic Careers in Higher Education](https://coache.gse.harvard.edu/)(COACHE) is a research-practice partnership that is operated out of Harvard University’s Graduate School of Education and is “dedicated to the discovery of and insight into the postsecondary faculty experience.” COACHE developed a Faculty Satisfaction Survey that it has been administering for the past decade which provides Fordham with another means to inform strategies aimed at improving faculty recruitment, satisfaction, success, and retention.By engaging with COACHE, Fordham has the opportunity to benchmark the experience of our faculty members within the University and through a national context by comparing our results against a COACHE-identified cohort of 85 institutions and five Fordham-selected peer institutions: Georgetown University, Lehigh University, Saint John’s University, Stony Brook University, and the University of Denver.

Participating in COACHE is a three-year partnership, providing Fordham with ongoing research and the opportunity to receive regular consultations on how to make sense of - and take action from - the results of the survey.
