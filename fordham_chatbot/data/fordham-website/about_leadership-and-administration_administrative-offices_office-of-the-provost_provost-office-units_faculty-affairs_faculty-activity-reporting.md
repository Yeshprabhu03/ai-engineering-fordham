# Faculty Activity Reporting

## Faculty Activity Reporting System

Faculty 180 is the University’s online database hosted by a company called Interfolio. It is used for collecting, storing, and reporting on data about the professional activity of the University’s faculty. It is more commonly known as the faculty activity reporting (FAR) system. The types of activity for which information is collected include teaching, research, grant applications and awards, professional service, professional development activities, service to the University, college, and department, honors and awards, and publications.

Most of your scheduled teaching data is uploaded automatically into the system. Faculty 180 will generate Activity Reports that can be used to complete some of the sections for Review, Reappointment, Tenure, and Promotion. You also have the option to create customized vitas using preset templates or by selecting from various available formats.

The Faculty 180 FAR system is available all year, and we encourage you to keep your data up to date. At a minimum, you should update your information each year by February 1st so we can generate your annual faculty activity report.

We also recommend a second update in June since data in the system is used for the Annual reports for each school and for the President's Fall letter to the university describing faculty accomplishments.

To access the Faculty Activity Report System, log in to [My-Pages](/), then select the "My Apps" tab. Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click on the Interfolio link (located on the left-hand channel). You will see the link to the reporting system on the left-hand side once you are brought into Interfolio. You can click on Profile and Activities to make any necessary updates/corrections.
