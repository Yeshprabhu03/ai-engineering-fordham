**What is the Professional Development Fund?**

As part of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between Fordham Faculty United and the University, a yearly fund of $25,000 was established for the duration of the CBA to support and promote the professional development of part-time faculty.

**What counts as "professional development"?**

Professional development funds are awarded to reimburse expenses for travel, registration, and lodging for conferences, workshops, or classes related to any part-time or full-time non-tenure track teaching faculty, covered by the union agreement (CBA), unit member's teaching and discipline.

**Who can apply?**

Any part-time or full-time non-tenure-track teaching faculty covered by the union agreement (CBA), regardless of teaching load or program, who has completed their probationary period.

**How much may I apply for?**

Part-time and full-time teaching faculty may receive funds of up to $1000 in total per academic year.

**When do I apply?**

Note that you need to be employed at the university in the semester the professional development was held in order to be eligible and must apply during that fiscal year (July 1 - May 31; June events will be billed to the next fiscal year, part-time faculty must have renewed contract to submit for June events)

**Who decides, and when?**

Requests for funds are screened by your peers on Fordham Faculty United’s Professional Development Committee, whose members are appointed by Fordham Faculty United’s elected representatives on the Executive Committee. Within the week following the request deadline, the committee will send applicants notice of acceptance or denial.
