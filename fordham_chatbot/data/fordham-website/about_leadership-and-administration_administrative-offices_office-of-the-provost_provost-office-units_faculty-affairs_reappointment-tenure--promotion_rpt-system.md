# RPT System

## Introduction to Reappointment, Promotion, and Tenure System (Interfolio RPT Module)

Interfolio is a secure online system used for supporting the faculty reviews for **reappointments, promotion, and appointments** **(RPT) **to tenure. This system simplifies the collection and organization of the documents specific to this process and provides secure access to faculty reviewers.

**How is the RPT process management changing?**

Starting in the Fall 2023 semester, you will no longer have to submit electronic copies of the personnel documents to our office by using either Google Drive, Blackboard, or Email. You will be required to use the Interfolio RPT module for the reappointment, promotion, and tenure process.

The schedule and steps for each of the personnel decisions have **not** been altered from what is present in the University Statutes. Please consult the Statutes if you require further guidance in this area.

Candidates for any of the personnel decisions (reappointment, promotion, and tenure) will be able to upload and share the necessary materials for the personnel committee, deans, and provost to review. It will automatically be sent forward to each step and allow department/school administrators to review the packets and add the necessary documentation to complete the process.

You will be able to log into the system thru the my.fordham.edu portal using the My Apps link. Another option is by navigating directly to the Interfolio website ([https://account.interfolio.com/sso](https://account.interfolio.com/sso)) and searching for Fordham University in the search box for partner institutions. You will be using your Fordham credentials to log in (DUO authentication).

Department/School administrators will have the ability to view what has been submitted and add any other materials required (external review letters, SEEQ’s, peer observations, norms, etc.). Please contact the OFA office if you need assistance in this area ([[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)).
