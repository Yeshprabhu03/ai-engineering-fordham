# GDL Course Design

Designing an online course is a shared effort between faculty and instructional designers. Our process is grounded in partnership: We combine your subject expertise with our experience in pedagogy and course design to build engaging, effective learning experiences.

**Partnering**

Throughout course design, the instructional designer is a partner who brings structure, strategy, and experience to the process. The goal is to support faculty expertise and help create a course that works—for you and your students.

Course design is not a solo project. We build it together.

**Building**

Faculty bring subject matter expertise, teaching experience, and goals for student learning. Instructional designers bring knowledge of module sequencing, online pedagogy, and learning technologies. Together, we create an intentional, well-organized course that supports meaningful student engagement.

Each stage of the process reflects this collaborative partnership.

**Planning**

In this early stage, faculty define the course’s purpose, develop learning objectives, and align assessments. The instructional designer outlines the scope of the design, offering structured frameworks, sample models, and practical ideas that help turn teaching goals into a clear, workable plan.

Collaboration ensures a strong foundation before content development begins.

**Drafting**

Faculty guide the content and teaching priorities; instructional designers contribute tools, strategies, and options for building engagement and accessibility into the course.

Designing together builds an effective and innovative learning experience.

**Testing**

Next, we review, test, and refine the course components. The instructor provides feedback and insights based on subject matter and teaching style; the instructional designer evaluates flow, clarity, and usability, suggesting technical edits or enhancements.

This shared review strengthens the course before it goes live.

**Finalizing**

In the lead-up to the course start, we confirm materials, test technology, and make sure students will have a smooth entry into the course. Faculty focus on teaching readiness; the instructional designer supports technical setup, navigation, and course logistics.

Working together, we ensure a confident, well-coordinated start.

**Implementing**

Once the course is live, we continue to support the teaching process. Instructional designers provide *just-in-time support* to address instructional or technical challenges as they arise. Whether it’s fixing a link, reworking an activity midstream, or resolving a tech issue, we’re available to help troubleshoot and adapt in real-time.

You can focus on teaching while we provide expert support when you need it.

**Updating**

After the course runs, we review its performance as a team. Faculty observations and other feedback inform what worked and what could be adjusted. Instructional designers

Continuous improvement prepares the course for future offerings.
