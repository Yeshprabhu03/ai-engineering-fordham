# GDL Program Design

Designing an online program is a strategic, team-based process. We work closely with program leaders to align curriculum goals, student needs, and instructional design best practices. The goal is to build a program that is cohesive, engaging, and sustainable.

Our work together ensures a strong foundation from first course to final credential.

**Partnering**

Program design begins with collaboration. Chairs, directors, and faculty bring academic vision and disciplinary depth. Instructional designers contribute structure, design expertise, and knowledge of online learning ecosystems. Together, we shape a program that reflects your values and supports your students.

Program design is not a checklist—it’s a shared endeavor.

**Framing**

In this early stage, we clarify the purpose of the program, define target audiences, and outline learning outcomes. A key part of this conversation is determining modality—whether the program will be fully online, hybrid, or flexible—and aligning that decision with student needs, institutional goals, and accreditation requirements. Together, we map the program’s structure—sequencing courses, aligning credit hours, and identifying key competencies.

A strong conceptual frame sets the direction for everything that follows.

**Mapping**

Next, we translate goals into a curriculum map. This includes identifying signature assessments, course connections, and progression pathways. Instructional designers offer frameworks that ensure balance, coherence, and scaffolded learning across the curriculum.

Curriculum mapping ensures each course fits into the bigger picture.

**Designing**

Individual course design begins once the program structure is in place. Faculty and instructional designers co-develop course-level objectives, assignments, and learning experiences that align with program outcomes.

Each course reflects the intentionality of the larger program design.

**Piloting**

Programs benefit from early testing—whether through sample courses, modules, or faculty pilots. Instructional designers support faculty in building pilot materials, gathering feedback, and refining approaches before full implementation.

Early feedback helps surface gaps and strengthen the student experience.

**Launching**

As the program nears launch, we work together to ensure alignment across all courses, finalize logistics, and support faculty preparation. Our team helps coordinate communication, training, and readiness across departments.

A coordinated launch supports both faculty confidence and student success.

**Evaluating**

Post-launch, we gather data and feedback to assess impact. Faculty insights, student performance, and stakeholder feedback guide continuous improvement efforts. Instructional designers help identify patterns, recommend changes, and plan for the next iteration.

Ongoing evaluation keeps the program dynamic and responsive.
