# Office of Institutional Research and Assessment

The Office of Institutional Research and Assessment (OIRA) is dedicated to providing accurate, timely, and consistent information about the University to the Fordham community, governmental and accrediting agencies, journalists and others. Its main objective is to supply information, data analyses, and high quality research in order to support decision–making that will increase the effectiveness of the University’s programs and the stewardship of its resources. Reporting to the Office of the Provost, the OIRA supports faculty–directed assessment of student learning and student outcomes and institutional assessment of the effectiveness of University–wide operations and services.
