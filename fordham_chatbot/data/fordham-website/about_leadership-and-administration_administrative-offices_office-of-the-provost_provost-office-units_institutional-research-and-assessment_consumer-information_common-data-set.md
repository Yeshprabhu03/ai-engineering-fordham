# Common Data Set

The [Common Data Set (CDS)](http://www.commondataset.org/) initiative is a collaborative effort among data providers in the higher education community and publishers as represented by the College Board, Peterson's, and U.S. News & World Report. The combined goal of this collaboration is to improve the quality and accuracy of information provided to all involved in a student's transition into higher education, as well as to reduce the reporting burden on data providers.

The CDS is organized into the following sections:

- A. General Information
- B. Enrollment and Persistence (including retention and graduation rates)
- C. First-Time, First-Year (Freshman) Admission
- D. Transfer Admission
- E. Academic Offerings and Policies
- F. Student Life
- G. Annual Expenses (i.e., tuition and fees)
- H. Financial Aid
- I. Instructional Faculty and Class Size
- J. Degrees Conferred
