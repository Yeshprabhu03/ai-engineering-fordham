# Equal Employment Opportunity

## University Wide Equal Employment Opportunity Statement

**The University's Mission Statement affirms that, in preparing "citizens for an increasingly multicultural and multinational society, Fordham seeks to develop in its students an understanding of and reverence for cultures and ways of life other than their own."**

The University’s Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) efforts provide for the enhanced effort to recruit, employ and promote women and members of cultural minorities. A faculty and staff with the capacity to further the University's interest in diversity also provides a pool of qualified and experienced mentors for the increasingly diverse student population in the New York metropolitan area.

The Director of Institutional Equity and Compliance is available to all members of the Fordham community for consultation and training, providing techniques and methods of ensuring non-discrimination as well as equal access and fair treatment of individuals.
