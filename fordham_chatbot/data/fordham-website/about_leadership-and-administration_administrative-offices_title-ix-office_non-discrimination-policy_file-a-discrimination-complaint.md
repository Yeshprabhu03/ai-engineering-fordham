# File a Discrimination Complaint

Fordham University has a zero-tolerance policy for any instance of discrimination for students, faculty, and staff. If you believe you or another member of the University community has been the victim of discrimination, please contact the appropriate University employee who can best address your concerns. The University does not want discrimination to continue, wants to prevent it from happening to another member of our community, and wants to maintain a safe and respectful learning environment.

The University will follow the appropriate handbooks, statutes, and grievance procedures that apply to the parties involved for determining whether there has been a violation of the University-wide Non-Discrimination Policy. Please use the links below to find the grievance procedure that applies to you.
