# Title IX Sexual and Related Misconduct

Fordham is committed to a learning, living, and work environment free of any kind of sexual violence or misconduct. The University will take prompt steps reasonably calculated to end the sexual violence, eliminate any hostile environment, prevent recurrences and, as appropriate, remedy any effects.

Fordham will enforce its policies on sexual offenses through internal conduct procedures that are fair, prompt and impartial. Student conduct cases will be handled by the respective Deans of Students on each campus (or the Dean's designee), while employee conduct cases will be handled by the Title IX Coordinator (or the Title IX Coordinator's designee).

For more information and full descriptions of prohibited conduct, please read the following:

Fordham University responds to all sexual offenses, stalking, domestic violence and dating violence incidents with a trained response team that includes the Department of Public Safety Officers, the Deans of Students, and the Title IX Coordinator, and where appropriate, staff from Residential Life, Health Services, Counseling Services and other off-campus resources.

**Update: **University policies on sexual and related misconduct apply to in-person interactions as well as online interactions. Members of the community are expected to maintain a tone of civility and respect during online classes and in online communications just as they would if they were physically on campus.
