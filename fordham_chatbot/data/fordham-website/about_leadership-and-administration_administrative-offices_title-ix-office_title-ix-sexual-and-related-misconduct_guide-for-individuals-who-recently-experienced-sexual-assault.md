# Guide for Individuals Who Recently Experienced Sexual Assault

#### If you have been the victim of a sexual assault:

**1.** Remain calm, find a safe place, and get help from someone you trust.

**2.** Do not change clothes, shower, use the restroom, or destroy any clothing. A rape or sexual abuse survivor should try to remain in the same condition as when the attacker left.

**3.** Seek immediate medical attention. The following hospitals conduct rape examinations:

- Rose Hill: North Central Bronx Hospital | 3424 Kossuth Ave., Bronx, NY | 718-519-5000
- Rose Hill: Jacobi Medical Center | Pelham Parkway South, Bronx, NY | 718-918-5000

The Health Center is also available to provide pregnancy tests and tests for sexually transmitted infections upon request.
