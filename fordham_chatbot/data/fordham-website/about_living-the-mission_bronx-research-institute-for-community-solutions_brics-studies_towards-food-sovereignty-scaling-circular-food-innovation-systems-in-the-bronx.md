# Towards Food Sovereignty: Scaling Circular Food Innovation Systems in the Bronx

Food apartheid, or restricted access to healthy food, disproportionately affects marginalized communities due to legacies of segregation and systemic exclusion. This issue is most severe among lower-income, female-headed, Black, Latine, and immigrant households, with the Bronx experiencing the highest rates of food insecurity in NYC (39%), representing a public health crisis. Our community-faculty partnership will pilot a food sovereignty initiative, an inclusive, community-centered approach that leverages local resources to address these challenges. Collaborating with ReBORN Farms, we will implement a sustainable circular economy model in the Bronx, evaluating its impact, sustainability, and scalability. This model focuses on health, cultural pride, and economic development by creating community-driven solutions for growing local food, reducing waste, and sourcing seasonal crops. Profits from produce sales will be reinvested to support farm operations, staffing, and product innovation, fostering long-term sustainability and community empowerment.
