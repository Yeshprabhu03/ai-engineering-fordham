# About Campus Ministry

**Cultivating values at the center of our lives: **Campus Ministry, with a university-wide presence seeks to foster the integral growth of the entire Fordham University community but especially focuses on the personal, spiritual, ethical and moral development of its students.

**Developing spiritual practices and resources: **The Ignatian spirituality that permeates us in Fordham will teach you to listen attentively to the deeper rhythms of your heart so you may come to know truth, act justly and love tenderly as you engage with the realities of the world.

**Building meaningful community: **Together with you, we are committed to raising up a community where you belong, where you are known, and where you feel connected to others.

You can be assured that in our Catholic and Jesuit institution, we celebrate diversity and differences in self-identity and description as much as in religion, culture, family origins and aspirations. Through encounters in conversation and service, we begin to recognize ourselves in the ‘other’ to create a new space where our “being-in-love” can flourish.

**Sharing talents generously: **We invite you to take advantage of the presence, services, and programs of Campus Ministry. In addition to offering a wide variety of programs, retreats, liturgies, and opportunities for both spiritual growth and social justice, we also live in student residences, worship in the community, teach, organize support groups, respond to emergencies, and serve on University committees and as academic advisers.
