# Catholic Mass Schedule

Our liturgies include Masses on Sundays and each day of the week. We also gather to mark milestones in campus life, from Freshmen Orientation to the Baccalaureate Mass before commencement, and to celebrate holy days and feasts throughout the year. Our Masses are complemented by [Praise and Worship](/about/living-the-mission/campus-ministry/create-community/praise-and-worship/), prayer services, and regular celebration of the Sacrament of Reconciliation.

*The Winter Break Mass Schedule is now in effect until January 11, 2026. Please note that Lincoln Center does not host Mass during the university break schedule.*
