# Student Liturgical Ministries

Catholic Liturgies at Fordham bring the community together to celebrate, give thanks, and ask God’s blessing in our lives. Students are the soul of our community’s worship and prayer. They play an active and integral role by serving at Masses and prayer services, taking leadership roles, and shaping and enlivening the way our community prays together.

Lift your voice and sing! Or read … or broadcast … or welcome … No matter your gift or interest, there is a way for you to live it out in our Fordham liturgies. Enrich our community worship by praying with us and by serving as a liturgical minister.


## Student Participation

-
Altar servers play an indispensable role in the Mass and work closely as a team to assist the presider and and set up for the celebration of the Eucharist.

## Student Leadership Initiatives

-
Student Liturgical Coordinators ensure that Mass flows smoothly, giving instruction and guidance to liturgical ministers. SLCs are leaders who empower ministers to do their jobs easily and with confidence. They also model reverence, prayerfulness, and maturity for the other ministers. Student liturgical ministers can apply to be Student Liturgical Coordinators after one year of service.

-
Representatives from each ministry, including music ministers, work together to train and support liturgical ministers. Board members plan and evaluate liturgies, work actively to build community among ministers and Mass-goers, and serve as mentors for new ministers. You can apply after one year of service.

-
Gather with your peers to reflect on upcoming Sunday readings and talk about how they connect to what’s on your mind - and provide valuable feedback to our presiders as they prepare student-centric homilies. Anyone is eligible to participate!

-
Seniors work together to plan the Baccalaureate Mass, including recommending readings, and selecting classmates to offer a welcome and a post-communion reflection. The work of the committee ensures that the Mass reflects the experience and hopes of the graduating class.
