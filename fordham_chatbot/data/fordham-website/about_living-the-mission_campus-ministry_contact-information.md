**Rev. Philip Judge, SJ** is our new Executive Director of Campus Ministry. Before accepting his position at Fordham, he spent many years in Jesuit secondary education teaching English and working in administration at McQuaid Jesuit, Fordham Prep, and Regis. As a native of Queens and a Fordham graduate, he is excited to be back at Rose Hill where he studied English as a Jesuit scholastic and did graduate work in philosophy, after which he pursued additional graduate studies in Theology and English in Berkeley, California. He believes that Jesuit spirituality -- from finding God in all things to seeking to be men and women for and with others -- can animate everything we do at a Jesuit and Catholic University. In his free time, Fr. Phil loves exploring New York and reading, particularly U.S. literature.

**Katie Anderson Kuo** is a big fan of incense, hymns, and stained glass but just as big a fan of finding God in unexpected places, whether it’s a quiet corner of the Botanical Gardens or the busy hum of Fordham Road. Katie has worked in ministry in a variety of settings: community organizing, accompanying and advocating for immigrants, coordinating disaster response teams, and, here at Fordham, working with student volunteers and leaders to coordinate prayerful, peaceful, and joyful Masses in our Church and chapels. She is also a resident minister for Walsh Hall, home of the Science Integrated Learning Community. She is most passionate about empowering students to discover their own spirituality, creativity, and wisdom. You can often find Katie in her Church basement lair —erm, office— but when she’s not there, she’s either creating a work of art, taking a walk with her family, or on a gustatory tour of the world. Katie grew up in “Small Wonder,” Delaware, home of farmstand peaches, winding hiking trails, and gorgeous beaches, and has trouble believing that she’s now been a New Yorker for ten years. She lives in the Bronx with her husband and their two tiny humans.

![Contact Information: Erin](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/CM_Erin_resized_again.jpg)


**Erin Hoffman** is starting her 14th year at Fordham! She lives with her family in McMahon Hall at Fordham Lincoln Center, where her main goal is to help students thrive during their time at Fordham. She facilitates Campus Ministry initiatives and partnerships for LC, which include interfaith and multi-faith initiatives, social justice conversations and programs, liturgy and spirituality events, and peer ministry, among others. Erin loves all things, well, most things, politics and won't shy away from an opportunity to have an engaging conversation about current events, social justice, and civic engagement (vote!). Perhaps this comes from her background studying international politics and foreign policy in college or social work with a global practice focus in graduate school. Erin is a proud (and tired) mom to 3 young kids who are very excited to have students return to McMahon hall and delight in saying hi to everyone they meet. If you find one of them wandering solo on campus, please return to Campus Ministry or McMahon 6G!

**Augustine** **M.** **Preziosi** born and raised in Princeton, New Jersey, Augustine cultivated an appreciation for the universality of the Church thanks to the immense diversity of his parish, St. Paul's on Nassau Street. Drawn to Fordham by its Catholic mission and gothic aesthetic, he graduated in 2023 with a B.A. in Theology, Religious Studies, and Philosophy. Augustine took a brief hiatus from the university in 2024 as a diplomatic fellow for the Holy See Mission to the United Nations. He worked under H.E. Archbishop Gabriele Caccia on the Holy See’s Security Council team, formulating reports on the fragile humanitarian conditions in Ukraine, Haiti, North Korea, and central/east African nations. Now a candidate for a Masters in Theological Studies at Rose Hill, he can be found balancing his sacristan and resident minister duties while producing a thesis on Mariology. But at the end of the day, he is most concerned with helping Fordham students discover their own unique relationship with Christ. Ever want to talk theology, spirituality, or life in general?
