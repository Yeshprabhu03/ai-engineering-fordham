# Commuter and Residential Ministry

## Heighten your commuter and residential experience!

Campus Ministry supports your commuter and residential experience through Presence, Partnership, and Liturgy in order to help you navigate the joys and challenges of college life; provide programs and opportunities for you to learn, serve, grow, and build community with one another; and offer opportunities for communal worship and prayer.

#### Presence

Our Residential Ministry programs connect live-in campus ministers, chaplains, and student volunteer leaders with residential students to support you and connect you with one another. Campus Ministers and Chaplains partner with the residential life staff to foster spiritual growth, provide counsel and conversation, and build community. We also have Campus Ministers who serve as liaisons to communities that do not have a live-in minister. Meet our Resident Ministers, Chaplains, Campus Ministry liaisons, and our past programs through the drop-down tabs below.

#### Partnership

Campus Ministers work closely with both Residential Life and commuter groups to provide programs that help enhance your Fordham experience and create communities of responsibility open to spiritual growth and social action. If you have an idea you'd like to partner with Campus Ministry to bring to life in the residence halls, please contact your building liaison. Commuter students can contact Gil Severiano at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

#### Liturgy

Many of the residence halls have Catholic Mass offered weekly, biweekly, or monthly. The schedule will vary, so check with your Priest-in-Residence. We also welcome the opportunity to offer prayer services and interfaith worship. Contact your resident minister or liaison to discuss these opportunities further.

All students are welcome to join our Sunday Masses and Weekday Masses.
