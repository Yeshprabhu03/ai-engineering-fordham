# LGBTQIA+ Spirituality

"I wanted a community to unpack my identity; I got so much more."

The Office of Campus Ministry wholeheartedly welcomes, celebrates, and supports all of our students, regardless of sexual orientation or gender expression. We look forward to meeting you and to letting you know that we are here for you as you explore your spirituality. Please let us know how we can assist you on your Fordham journey. WELCOME!! WELCOME!! WELCOME!!

We hope you will consider participating in the [PRISM Retreat](https://www.fordham.edu/about/living-the-mission/campus-ministry/retreat-ministry/undergraduate-opportunities/), which is for LGBTQIA+ students looking for a safe and welcoming space to explore and deepen their relationship with God, however they define the Divine. It is a chance to experience God's unconditional love, and to explore the multiple aspects of your relationships with God, self, and with others on a similar journey.

"I wanted to see how my faith and spirituality connect or even if they connected. I now know they are inextricable from each other."

PRISM draws from a foundation of Catholic-Christian spirituality but welcomes students of all backgrounds and experiences. In the spirit of the Jesuit educational tenet, *Cura Personalis*, and the USCCB Pastoral letter, Always our Children (1997), Campus Ministry wishes to offer the enormous spiritual resources of the Church, and to enable LGBTQIA+ students to flourish spiritually and holistically and to "discover what you believe and find where you belong.”

**Spiritual and Pastoral Counseling and Additional Resources for LGBTQIA+ Students**

All of our Campus Ministers are allies who are available for spiritual and pastoral counseling.

The Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities holds the IgnatianQ Conference to gather LGBTQIA+ students from the 27 Jesuit Colleges to reflect on queer issues as they relate to spirituality. IgnatianQ focuses on community, spirituality, and inclusion, featuring powerful speeches, affirmations, and a call to activism that moved attendees profoundly. In 2023, Fordham hosted the IgnatianQ conference. This past April, ten students traveled to the IgnatianQ Conference at St. Louis University. CM will be organizing a student delegation to attend IgnatianQ '25 which will be hosted by Loyola Marymount University (April 3-6, 2025).
