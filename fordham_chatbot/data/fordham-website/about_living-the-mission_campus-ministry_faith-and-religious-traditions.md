# Faith and Religious Traditions

![group of students standing in group for picture after MSA event](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/campus-ministry/realFaith-and-Religious-Traditions.jpg)

Fordham's Campus Ministry welcomes students of many different faith religious traditions and belief systems. We collaborate with members of the many faith-based student clubs, such as the Fordham Christian Fellowship, the Jewish Student Organization, the Muslim Student, and the Orthodox Christian Fellowship. Without question, one's faith is a great gift of God that must be respected and nourished.

We encourage students to learn more about their own faith tradition by examining its teachings and values in an academic yet very personal way. We work with individuals and student groups to offer interfaith programming that help students learn from one another about their various traditions.

Fordham is a University in the Catholic and Jesuit tradition and we abide by the principles of religious freedom that protect the rights of individuals to practice their own religion. We welcome all of our students and hope that the richness of spiritual and religious traditions is a blessing to all of us! Stop by our office to introduce yourselves and get to know our Campus Ministry team.
