# Sacred Spaces

**Note: **[The University Church is available for Catholic weddings ](/about/living-the-mission/campus-ministry/weddings-at-fordham/)for current students, staff, and alumni of Fordham University (and Fordham Preparatory School). Additionally, the University Church is usually only available for funerals of Jesuit priests. However, members of the Fordham community, including parents and alumni, are welcome to submit mass intentions to remember a loved one or pray for a loved one during a time of need. Campus Ministry collects a $10 donation per mass intention which helps to support ministries here at Rose Hill. Donations can be made in person at our office, or by mailing in cash or cheque payable to Fordham University Campus Ministry.
