# Jewish Life Faculty and Staff

Members of Fordham staff and faculty are welcome to join Jewish Life events for any learning opportunities including our B'Mitzvah program, holiday gatherings, and more. Please join our network and [subscribe to our e-newsletter ](https://FordhamCampusMin.flocknote.com/JewishLife)to stay up to date on all things Jewish at Fordham!

As Fordham's Jewish chaplain and campus rabbi, and as former tenured faculty herself, Rabbi Katja Vehlow (she/her) is available for confidential rabbinic conversations in person, via zoom, or on the phone. If you are facing a crisis, are looking for a listening ear or would simply like to have a chat, you can contact her at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#583e372a3c3039352a393a3a31183e372a3c303935763d3c2d), or call her at 212-636-6405.

## Jewish Text Group

Convened by Jason Morris (Natural Sciences) and Karina Hogan (Theology), the Jewish texts group for Jewish and non-Jewish faculty and staff gathers three times per semester for convivial conversation over Jewish texts, broadly interpreted. In the past we have studied a wide gamut of sources, ranging from Levinas’ Talmudic Readings, to Scholem’s writings on mysticism, to selections from the Hebrew Bible and Talmud, to modern Torah commentary.

All faculty and staff are welcome! For more information, contact Jason Morris ([[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4a29202b2725383823390a2c25382e222b27642f2e3f)).
