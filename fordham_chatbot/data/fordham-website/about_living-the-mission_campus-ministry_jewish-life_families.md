# Jewish Life Families

## Shalom!

We are so excited to welcome you and your student to Fordham Jewish Life! We are here to support your child’s needs and interests in any way we can so they can identify what they want to experience through Jewish life on campus.

Whether they are looking for a community on campus, need a place to celebrate the holidays or are seeking a leadership role, we are here to support them. Please join our network and [subscribe to our e-newsletter ](https://FordhamCampusMin.flocknote.com/JewishLife)to stay up to date on all things Jewish at Fordham.

Fordham Jewish Life is here to provide your child with a Jewish home away from home to make their college journey a little smoother. Next time you are on campus, we hope you stop by to say hi, and thank you for trusting us with your student!
