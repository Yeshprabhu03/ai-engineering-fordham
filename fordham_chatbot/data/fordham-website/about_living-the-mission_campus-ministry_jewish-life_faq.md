# Jewish Life at Fordham FAQ

**How many Jewish students are there at Fordham?**About 2.5% of Fordham's students are Jewish, which translates to about 600 undergraduate and graduate students. This is in addition to the many members of faculty and staff who also belong to our community.

**Is there a Hillel at Fordham?**No, we do not have a Hillel, we have two JSOs (Jewish Student Organizations) that organize Shabbat dinners and holiday celebrations and other events, together with our campus rabbi and Jewish chaplain, Rabbi Katja Vehlow. In addition, we are proud to collaborate with the nearby Baruch Hillel, as well as the Chabad of the West Sixties.

**Can I find kosher food on campus? **At Lincoln Center, packaged sandwiches, salads, sushi and soups with a hechsher (kosher certification) can be found in the Schmeltzer Dining Room in the Law School. At the Rose Hill campus, you can find prepared frozen lunches and soups at the Marketplace Cafeteria.

**Is it difficult to be Jewish at Fordham, since it's a Jesuit school? **We don't think so! Fordham has a long and proud tradition of welcoming non-Catholic students, and especially Jews, to its campuses. The Jesuit ideas on which Fordham was founded, such as caring for others, are in fact not so different from values expressed throughout Jewish tradition. These principles invite all members of the Fordham community to open themselves up to curiosity, and to explore traditions that are not their own. This, we hope, creates an environment where people of all faiths feel that they belong, and fosters a culture of curiosity. We are proud to be Jewsuits!

**How about antisemitism? Is there antisemitism on campus? **There have been no acts of violence, and students are free to live their Jewish lives. Like many schools, we have experienced isolated bias incidents, and some of these have been directed toward the Jewish community. Fordham firmly asserts that these incidents are not accepted or tolerated in any way, and the administration takes them extremely seriously. Please contact

**Do students have to take courses on Catholicism? **No! As part of Fordham's core curriculum, students take a class in philosophy as well as at the Theology Department. They can choose from among a number of courses, among them an introduction to the Torah and Scriptures of the World. This requirement grew out of Fordham's commitment to Jesuit values and aims to foster a sense of ourselves as spiritual beings and a curiosity in others.

**Do students have to attend church? **No! Fordham invites all members of the Fordham community to mark important moments such as the opening of the school year, with spiritual reflection. Some Jewish students sing in the choir that beautifies Sunday services or occasionally join their friends at church. All are welcome to learn more about Catholicism - and perhaps their own spirituality. But attendance is never required. Conversely, all are welcome to come to a Shabbat dinner or our Community Seder!
