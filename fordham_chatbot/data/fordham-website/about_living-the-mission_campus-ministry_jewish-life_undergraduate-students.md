# Jewish Life Undergraduate Students

## Welcome!

Looking to make new friends? Or perhaps a Shabbat meal, a place to celebrate Rosh Hashanah or Passover, or a chance to explore New York’s rich Jewish history? No matter your background, how you express your Jewish identity, or your level of religious observance: We're here for you.

And if you're new to Fordham, we're here to help make your transition smoother, both on campus and in the Big Apple. We can’t wait to meet you!

### Thinking About Coming to Fordham?

We are happy to answer any questions you may have. Tell us more about yourself and someone from the JSO (Jewish Student Organization) or our campus rabbi will get back to you!

### Who we are: Meet our Jewish Clubs!

Join the *Jewish Student Organization *– the JSO! A strong and vibrant student community, there are undergraduate clubs on both the Lincoln Center and the Rose Hill campuses.

The JSO honors the cultural and religious traditions of the Jewish community, and fosters a warm environment for Jewish students and anyone else who wants to learn more about Judaism and Jewish culture. There's Shabbat dinners, nature hikes, a *shabbaton* (retreat) and more!
