# Campus Ministry Retreats

## Join us on a Fordham Retreat!

Want a break from the city? Want to build community with Fordham students? Want space and time to reflect? Fordham Retreats is the place to be! Join us on weekend long retreats at our retreat house in Goshen, NY. Each retreat is carefully cultivated by our amazing retreat leaders for a great experience for retreatants.

Retreats are a great opportunity for reflection and renewal, and are an encouraging time to taste and see the goodness of God in our own lives and the beauty of the world around us. Students of all faiths, backgrounds, and religious experience are welcome and with a variety of unique retreats, a beautiful retreat house, and a gifted team of student leaders we hope you will find an opportunity to join us throughout the year. Please follow the links below to learn more, and feel free to contact us anytime with questions.

**All Fordham students are encouraged to participate in our retreats** - members of all faiths, residents of all campuses, and commuters of all distances. We hope to see you on retreat soon!
