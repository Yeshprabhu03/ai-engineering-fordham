# Wedding Music

It is the Office of Campus Ministry’s intent to provide you with music that is beautiful, spiritually uplifting, liturgically appropriate, and upholds the integrity and quality of liturgical music at Fordham University Church. Please keep this in mind as you plan your ceremony.

Mr. Robert Minotti, Director of Music at Fordham University, conducts a Wedding Music Showcase two times a year in the University Church. Mr. Minotti will review the music for the liturgy and play some of the available selections. Several instrumentalists and soloists will also be available to help you in your selections.

Our next Wedding Music Showcases will be held on the following dates:

**Time and Date TBD**
