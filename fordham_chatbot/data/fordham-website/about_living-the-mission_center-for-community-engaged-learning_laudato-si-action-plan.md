# Laudato Si’: A Fordham Green Plan

We do not have time to wait. We have the instruments. This is the moment to act. We are at the edge.

On Earth Day 2021, Pope Francis issued a bold new imperative to our world to act courageously in addressing climate change. Pope Francis called for a full-fledged response from the Catholic Church to turn the words of his 2015 encyclical, "Laudato Si', on Care for Our Common Home," into actions. Called the Laudato Si’ Action Platform, this bold and visionary approach asks all Catholic institutions to holistically transform over the next seven years to stave off catastrophic global warming.

Fordham has answered the call. We are inspired to action. The time is now.
