**Olivia Poust **began as the assistant director of the CRC in April 2025.

Before joining Fordham, Poust was a communications and marketing officer for Catholic Near East Welfare Association (CNEWA). She also served as assistant editor of its magazine, *ONE*, and as an accredited representative of CNEWA to the United Nations. During her tenure at CNEWA, Poust was particularly concerned with issues pertaining to women, peace, and security; safe migration; food insecurity; and cultural heritage, the latter of which she explored in her article, “[Erasing Identity](https://cnewa.org/magazine/erasing-identity/).”

Her interest in the intersection of politics, religion, and the arts was fostered during her time as an arts and culture reporter at upstate New York newspapers, including Syracuse.com/The Post-Standard and Spotlight News.

Poust is a Le Moyne College graduate and brings a deep understanding and commitment to Jesuit values with her to Fordham.
