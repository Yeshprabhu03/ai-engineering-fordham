The Duffy Fellows Program at Fordham University’s Center on Religion and Culture aims to provide support to a select group of Fordham students and recent graduates to advance the study of issues arising at the intersection of religion and public life. The Duffy Fellows Program will serve as an incubator of new projects, with the goal of stimulating ideas, research, and creative endeavors that foster a culture of encounter as well as intellectual engagement. [Duffy Fellows](https://www.fordham.edu/about/living-the-mission/center-on-religion-and-culture/duffy-fellows-program/current-duffy-fellows/) will also work alongside the CRC staff at regular intervals. In this way, Duffy Fellows will contribute to the mission of the CRC and the mission of New York’s Jesuit University.

### Interested in becoming a Duffy Fellow?

The Duffy Fellows Program is open to undergraduate students, graduate students, and recent graduates wanting to launch creative projects. This award is not intended to supplement ongoing postgraduate research. Applicants can be from any faith tradition, or no particular tradition, but their work must advance the Jesuit mission of engagement with the world and it must contend with issues of culture and religion.
