# Become a Duffy Fellow

### Eligibility

The Duffy Fellows Program is made possible by a bequest to the CRC by the late Jim Duffy. The Duffy Fellows Program is open to undergraduate students, graduate students, and recent graduates wanting to launch creative projects. This award is not intended to supplement ongoing postgraduate research. Applicants can be from any faith tradition, or no particular tradition, but their work must advance the Jesuit mission of engagement with the world and it must contend with issues of culture and religion.

### Responsibilities

Each Duffy Fellow will be required to provide a detailed proposal for their project with the aim of presenting their work in a lecture, exhibit, reading, or other suitable framework at the conclusion of their fellowship. Duffy Fellows should be self-starters who will contribute to the execution of CRC events throughout the year. They will be expected to provide content for the CRC’s blog, for example, and CRC programs could be used to inform their work as well as serving as a platform for it. Duffy Fellows will be expected to staff CRC’s events both on- and off-campus and to attend monthly in-person meetings with the program advisor.

### Stipend

Each Duffy Fellow will receive stipends of up to **$5,000** dollars for the duration of the program, which begins on **July 1, 2025** and concludes on **June 30, 2026**. The stipend would be adjusted according to the scope of the project and contribution.

### Applications

Each applicant must submit a resume, a brief research proposal (2-3 pages), and two (2) letters of reference. The proposal should include an explanation of how the candidate would contribute to the mission of the CRC and to the public conversation on religion and culture.

*Applications are closed for the 2025-2026 Duffy Fellowship*.
