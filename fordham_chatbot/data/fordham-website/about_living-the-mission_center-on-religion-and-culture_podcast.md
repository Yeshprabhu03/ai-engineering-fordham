Blair Braverman — musher, adventurer, and writer — joins the Center on Religion and Culture for the latest episode of "Art & Soul." Blair chats with David Gibson about her memoir, "Welcome to the Goddamn Ice Cube," her adventurous spirit, and her experience as one of the first Jewish women to complete the grueling Iditarod dogsledding race.

Sister Helen Prejean, author of *Dead Man Walking*, discusses her path to becoming a fierce opponent of the death penalty on the latest episode of *Art & Soul*. Sister Helen speaks with David Gibson, director of the CRC, about her memoir's legacy, the ongoing debate surrounding the death penalty, and her own awakening to justice.

This episode of *Art & Soul* welcomes Gregory Maguire, the acclaimed author of *Wicked*, the novel which spawned a hit Broadway show and two feature films. Gregory chats with Olivia Poust, assistant director of the CRC, about good versus evil, fantasy as an awe-inspiring genre, and faith and spirituality in *Wicked*.
