## Mission and Vision

Rooted in our Jesuit-Catholic identity, the Office of Equity, Inclusion, and Opportunity advances Fordham’s shared commitment to create and sustain a diverse, inclusive, and just campus community in which all members thrive through strategic and purposeful collaborations across the university and in our neighboring communities in the Bronx and Manhattan.
