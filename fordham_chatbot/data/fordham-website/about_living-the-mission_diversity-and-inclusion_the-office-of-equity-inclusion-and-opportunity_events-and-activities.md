*Sudan: Violence, Political Economy, and Environmental History*

Wednesday, April 17 at 5:00 p.m.

Fordham University Lincoln Center Campus

Lowenstein Building | South Lounge

This event examines the underreported but catastrophic ongoing war in Sudan that has killed thousands of Sudanese, placed the country on the brink of famine, and turned millions into internal displaced people or refugees. Join us for a conversation with renowned experts on Sudan who will discuss the political, economic, and environmental context behind the violence. The event is part of a four-part series examining armed violence and forced displacement around the world.

**Dr. Khalid Mustafa Medani** is Associate Professor of Political Science and Islamic Studies and Chair of the African Studies Program at McGill. He is the author of *Black Markets and Militants: Informal Networks in the Middle East and Africa* (Cambridge 2021) and is presently working on a study of the politics of protest, focusing on Sudan’s 2018 popular uprising.

**Dr. Alex de Waal** is executive director of the World Peace Foundation and Research Professor at the Fletcher School, Tufts University. His recent books include: *Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine *(Polity 2018) and (co-authored) *Sudan’s Unfinished Democracy: The Promise and Betrayal of a People’s Revolution* (Hurst 2022).
