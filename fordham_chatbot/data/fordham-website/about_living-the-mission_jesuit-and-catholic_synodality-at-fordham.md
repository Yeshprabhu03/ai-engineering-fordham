# Synodality at Fordham

Synod on Synodality: The term synod comes from the Greek syn = together and hodos = journey. Pope Francis has called on all levels of church membership to a multi-year process of attentive listening, open sharing, and discerning as followers of Christ journeying into the third millennium. How are we walking together as God's pilgrim people? What are our hopes and fears? How is the Spirit leading us to grow along the way? How are we bringing the power of the good news to a world in desperate need of light, hope, and healing?

This synodal process expresses both the path and the style of being the Church. Insights and findings will be summarized, recorded, and sent to the Vatican. The first phase began in October last year and will end this April. Different groups are being formed here at Fordham. Students, staff, faculty, and community partners are encouraged to participate in groups at both the RH and LC campuses. Participants may come to one or more of the meetings. Please direct inquiries to Campus Ministry, the Center for Community Engaged Learning, and the Center on Religion & Culture.
