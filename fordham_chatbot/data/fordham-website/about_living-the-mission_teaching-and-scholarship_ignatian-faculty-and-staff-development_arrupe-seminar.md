# Arrupe Seminar

### Overview

The Arrupe Seminar provides faculty and staff with an introduction to the lives of St. Ignatius and his companions, Ignatian spirituality, and Jesuit higher education. Participants will be invited to read and discuss texts from preeminent scholars of the Society of Jesus to help inform these discussions. In-person presentations from Jesuits at the Spellman Hall community and faculty and staff contributing to this work will create lively forums for participants to learn more about what it means to call ourselves a Jesuit university and how Fordham fits into the broader higher education landscape.

### Qualification

Administrators and Faculty who may be new to Jesuit education and show interest in learning more or longer-term colleagues who have not had the opportunity for a formal mission development program.

The Arrupe Seminar not only enhanced my understanding of Jesuit tradition and values, but also provided me with an opportunity to reflect on how I can carry forward Fordham's mission in my own personal and distinct way. I was very fortunate to be able to participate with colleagues from various areas throughout the University, and connect on a shared commitment to service, integrity and transformation.
