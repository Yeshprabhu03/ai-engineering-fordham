## Our Strategic Vision

We can **become more Jesuit** by centering our students and improving their outcomes. We can better **embody a full university** by investing in STEM, breaking down silos, and coming together across fields. And we can **engage more fully with our hometown** and the breathtaking opportunities it provides our students, faculty, staff, and alumni.

Fordham will be the first choice for students who want to matter to the world. Fordham stands in a category of one. In a nation of thousands of universities—and 27 Jesuit institutions of higher education—there is only one Jesuit university in New York City, the capital of the world.

## Strategic Priorities

Our strategic vision is informed by three core priorities that drive our mission: centering students, advancing research and academic excellence, and forging community.
