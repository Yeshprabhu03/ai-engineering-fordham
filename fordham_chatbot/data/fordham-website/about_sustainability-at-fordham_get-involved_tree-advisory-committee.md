Keeping with Fordham's commitment to protect the environment and foster conservation efforts on campus and in our surrounding neighborhood, the University established a Tree Advisory Committee.

In collaboration with the Department of Campus Operations the Tree Advisory Committee meets to discuss the University's Tree Care Plan which serves as framework for planting, maintaining and removing trees from campus while inspiring learning and fostering a more sustainable way of living.

The goal of the University's Tree Care Plan

- Maintain a healthy and diverse tree and shrub population.
- Provide opportunities for students to learn proper tree care practices.
- Provide safe and beautiful trees for the benefit of the Fordham Community and our visitors.
- Utilize nationally recognized ANSI tree care standards and ISA best management practices to ensure the health of our tree population and the safety of our tree care workers.

In 2015, Fordham joined [Tree Campus USA](http://www.arborday.org/programs/treecampususa/), which is a national program that was launched in 2008 by the Arbor Day Foundation and is designed specifically to help colleges and universities promote tree conservation and be a catalyst for fostering student engagement.

Participating in the program requires that Fordham meet five standards which include the following items:

- Establish and maintain an official tree advisory committee.
- Submit a comprehensive campus tree conservation and action plan.
- Dedicate annual expenditures specifically geared towards tree/ forest conservation efforts on campus.
- Promote an annual Arbor Day tree planting observance.
- Identify at minimum one student service learning project per year.
