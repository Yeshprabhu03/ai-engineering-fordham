# Solar Projects

## Here Comes the Sun!

As part of a continuing commitment to reduce its carbon footprint, Fordham has increased its sustainable energy sources with the use of on- and off-campus solar arrays. The following are recent major solar projects:

**Fordham Staten Island Solar Project**

This 2.6 MW ground mounted solar project is the largest solar array dedicated to any educational entity in NYC.

- System was formally placed in service in June 2018
- The project has generated over 7,300 MWH to date, with Fordham owning and retiring 100% of the associated Renewable Energy Credits (substantial LL 97 benefits)
- System has saved Fordham over $185,000 on its ConEdison electric bills to date

**Rose Hill Parking Garage Community Solar Project**

This 960 kW roof mounted system is the largest Community Solar project to be hosted by any educational entity in NYC.

- System was placed in service in September 2019, and has generated over 1,000 MWH to date
- Fordham University has saved over $53,000 to date from this project
- Innovative Community Solar structure allows Fordham to share the savings with other “subscribers,” including St. Paul’s and over 30 small Fordham accounts across NYC
