# Office of Sustainability Internship Program

The Internship Program at the Fordham Office of Sustainability offers students a unique opportunity to engage with sustainability initiatives while developing essential skills for their future careers. Interns work on meaningful projects that align with the university's sustainability goals, receive comprehensive training, and participate in workshops and networking events.

Through hands-on experience and collaborative teamwork, interns will gain insights into various aspects of sustainability, contribute to impactful projects, and enhance their professional portfolios. This program not only fosters personal and professional growth but also nurtures a culture of sustainability within the campus community.

## Our Interns

We have 32 Interns who have applied to this program in Fall ‘24.

These students major in:

- Environmental Studies/Science
- Primary degree, with 25% interns studying:

- International Studies
- Psychology
- Economics
- Business
- Communications
- Engineering
- New Media and Digital Design


Women make up only 32% of the workforce in the renewable energy sector, our program hopes to change that. Most of these students wouldn’t be exposed to facilities based sustainability if it weren’t for this program.
