# About Social Innovation Collaboratory

## What is Social Innovation?

**Social Innovations** are novel, scalable solutions to systemic social and environmental issues. These solutions are more effective than traditional solutions, because they rely on **stakeholder collaboration**, **cross-sector thinking**, and an interdisciplinary approach to achieve more measurable, efficient and **sustainable outcome**.

The problems facing the world today — hunger, poverty, climate change, disease — are more complex than ever before. Markets and governments have failed to solve these issues, which creates an opportunity for entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs to innovate solutions through collaboration and creativity.

## What We Do

We are a [network of Fordham University students, faculty, administrators, alumni and community members](/about/sustainability-at-fordham/social-innovation-collaboratory/core-group/), working together to promote social innovation for the achievement of social justice, social entrepreneurship, and environmental sustainability. We do this through:

- Curricular, co-curricular, and extracurricular initiatives
- Cross audience and cross-school collaborations
- Community engagement events and program opportunities
