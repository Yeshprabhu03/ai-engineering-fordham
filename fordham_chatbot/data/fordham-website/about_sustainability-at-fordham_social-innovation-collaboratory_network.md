# Social Innovation Collaboratory Network

The Collaboratory is **not** another center or institute. We **are** a network of exciting academic and research programs, institutes and centers, student groups and neighborhood partners coming together through the process of collaboration.

## What makes us different from a Partnership?

**Collaboration**: we are pooling our energies and resources to accomplish things that have never been done before.

Fordham has a network of **centers**, **institutes** and **academic programs** dedicated to** social innovation** and community outreach. This list is always growing as we expand our Changemaker Campus outreach.
