[Center for Community Engaged Learning](/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/external-affairs/center-for-community-engaged-learning/)

The Center for Community Engaged Learning is grounded in the Jesuit philosophy of homines pro aliis, men and women for others. We work to create mutually beneficial relationships rooted in a respect for the dignity of all persons.

[The Center for Urban Ecology (CUE)](/academics/departments/biological-sciences/)

The Mission of the CCEUE is to promote individual and collaborative research in integrated fields within ecology, evolution, and conservation. The CCEUE also addresses the effects of climate change and urbanization on regional ecosystems and the roles of humans in physiological, ecological and evolutionary processes.

[The Center for Ethics Education at Fordham University](/academics/centers-and-institutes/center-for-ethics-education/)

The Center was established to augment Fordham's commitment to cultivate life-long habits of critical thinking, moral reflection, and articulate expression, drawing upon the Jesuit maxims of Wisdom and Learning and Men and Women for Others. The Center provides a broad range of multidisciplinary ethics education opportunities, including degree programs, major lectures and support for ethics research and scholarship.
