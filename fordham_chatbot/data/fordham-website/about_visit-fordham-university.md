# Visit Fordham University

## NYC is the perfect setting for a college education.

**Come visit us and find out for yourself.**

The truth is, there are 8.5 million versions of New York City, and over time, you make your own.

- You have the street cart, where the owner knows how you take your coffee.
- Your regular Ram van seat, where you watch the sun glinting on the river as you head to the Rose Hill campus.
- Your stone bench, where you read outside in the shade.
- You have your pizza place, your routine from the residence hall to class, your favorite museum.

**It's your personal path through the city that never sleeps.**
