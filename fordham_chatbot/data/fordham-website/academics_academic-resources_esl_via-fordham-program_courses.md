# Via Fordham Courses

Courses in the *Via Fordham* program emphasize communication skills needed for academic success. Students improve English language proficiency and earn credits toward their degree program.

Via Fordham study plans include courses such as: Academic Writing and Communication Skills, US Cultural and History, Finite Math, Intercultural Skills, Intro to World Religions, Presentation and Public Speaking, Global Citizenship, Service Learning, New York Issues and Events, etc.

**Standard Study Plan (Two Semesters)**

The standard study plan includes two semesters of full-time study in the Via Fordham program. Students enrolled in the standard study plan will **earn nine college credits** toward their degrees over two semesters.

For instance, student “A” may begin in the spring semester and complete his Via Fordham studies in the summer. Student A would begin his undergraduate studies in the fall semester. Student “B” might begin in the summer and complete her Via Fordham studies in the fall. Student B would begin her undergraduate studies in the spring semester. Student “C” might begin in the fall and complete her Via Fordham studies in the spring. Student C would begin her undergraduate studies in the summer or fall.

Special note: students who begin their studies in the summer or fall semester will have the option to “test out” at the end of the fall semester by taking the Fordham English Language Test (FELT). In other words, if Student C began her studies in the fall semester and made rapid progress, she could potentially “test out” of the Via Fordham program and begin her undergraduate studies in the spring.

**Express Study Plan (One Semester)**

The express study plan includes one semester of full-time study in the Via Fordham program. Students enrolled in the express study plan will **earn three to six college credits** toward their degrees. The express study plan is reserved for students who have demonstrated above average English language skills but require additional support for academic English.

**Successful Completion**

In order to complete Via Fordham successfully, students must maintain a B+ average in classes and meet the exit criteria of the Fordham English Language Test (FELT).
