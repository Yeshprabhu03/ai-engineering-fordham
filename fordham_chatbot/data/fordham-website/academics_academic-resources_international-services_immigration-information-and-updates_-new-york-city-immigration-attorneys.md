# New York City Immigration Attorneys

If you intend to work in the United States beyond your authorized period of practical or academic training, or if you need advice on other immigration matters not related to your status as an F-1 or J-1 non-immigrant, you may need to retain an attorney who specializes in immigration matters.

It is important to be thorough and careful in selecting an immigration attorney. A good attorney will communicate clearly and accurately your options, will answer all your questions, and will be your advocate with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Department of Labor, Department of State or any other government agency to which you must petition or communicate.

## Questions for Attorney

Following are some questions you should ask when considering an attorney:

- What is your fee and what services does the payment include? Am I charged every time I speak to you?
- Is your practice limited to immigration law? How long have you been practicing in immigration law?
- Are you a member of the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA)? Of what other professional associations are you a member? What role do you play in these associations? Do you make conference presentations, write journal articles, or hold an elected office?
- What is your specialization within immigration law?
- Have you handled any cases similar to mine? If so, how many? What was the outcome?
- What is your fee and what services does the payment include? Am I charged every time I speak to you?
- Who will actually handle my case, you or a paralegal? If it is a paralegal, can I meet him/her?
- What is the best way to communicate with you-by telephone, email, or in person? How long do you normally take to return a message?

The American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) provides the names and contact information of immigration attorneys throughout the United States. Find more [AILA information](http://www.aila.org/).
