# International Services Programs and Events

## Let's Get Together

The Office for International Services hosts several events throughout the semester. These sessions are typically visa-related and help students understand how to maintain their immigration status, navigate U.S. regulations, and explore F-1 and J-1 work authorization options.

**Upcoming Events & Webinars**

Join us for our upcoming OIS workshops, information sessions, and webinars:

**International Student Orientations**

[Our Global Transition Program](/academics/academic-resources/international-services/programs-and-events/global-transition/) welcomes **undergraduate** international students to Fordham and helps with adjusting to the first days and weeks here. During Global Transition, new students will have the opportunity to meet and get to know other international students from all over the world, attend important and helpful information sessions, and engage in some fun activities/events.

International Graduate Students, please contact your school's admissions office for more information regarding their upcoming orientation dates.
