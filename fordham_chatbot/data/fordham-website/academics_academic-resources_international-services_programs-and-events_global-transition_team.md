**Thank you for your interest in joining the Global Transition team! Applications to join the GT team for the 2026 Global Transition program will be coming in the Spring.**

## Joining the Global Transition Team

Do you remember how you felt when you first arrived at Fordham - a little lost and scared by a new place and new faces? Every student goes through their own transition experience. Maybe you are an international student yourself, or you studied abroad, and you know that finding your way in a new place can be challenging. Do you want to help new international students find their way at Fordham? If so, applying to be a Global Transition Team Member is perfect for you!
