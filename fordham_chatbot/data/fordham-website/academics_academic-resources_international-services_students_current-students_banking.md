# Banking Information for International Students

Below you can find information on the major banks near our campuses. You don’t need a social security number to open a bank account. However, some banks may request a letter issued by our office to proof that you are an international student. If you need a bank letter, please email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c4abadb784a2abb6a0aca5a9eaa1a0b1) for assistance.

In order to prevent you from earning interest on your funds in a bank account and to subsequently be required to declare that interest when you file taxes, you should get a letter from the OIS before opening a bank account.
