# Curricular Practical Training

## What is CPT

Curricular Practical Training—CPT is a type of academics-related work/training authorization for F-1s to get practical experience in their field of study. CPT, when authorized, can be used during the degree program. It is not available after the degree program.

Curricular Practical Training (CPT) allows you, as an F-1 student, to accept an off-campus internship or employment offer, as long as it is an integral part of your curriculum or is directly related to your curriculum.

### Eligibility

- Immigration regulations make CPT available to F-1 students who have been
**lawfully enrolled on a full-time basis****for at least one academic year**.

Note: In the case of Gabelli School of Business graduate students, lawfully enrolled full-time for two trimesters is considered eligible for CPT. - Securing an internship offer directly related to the student's degree program.
- CPT must be connected to academic credits, such as internship or practicum credits. We will not be able to process your CPT until after we see your internship credit registration in the university database.
- Exception (rare): Such practical training is a requirement for the degree program. In this case, the requirement must be documented by the degree bulletin or a different school publication.

The OIS CPT portal is a private link only shared with advisors. - A DSO will review the CPT application submitted by your advisor and then issue your CPT authorization (a new I-20). Once a complete CPT application is received, OIS requires 2-3 business days to process your updated I-20. Please stand by during this time. We will notify you when it is ready, and send an update version to your Fordham email, which you should print and sign.

Note: You may not begin your position before receiving the CPT authorized I-20 from the OIS.
