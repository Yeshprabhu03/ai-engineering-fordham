# On Campus

For F-1 students, on-campus employment is "incident to status." This means that you are allowed to work on campus at any point while you are pursuing your studies and maintaining legal status. Visa regulations limit on-campus employment to 20 hours per week while school is in session, but may increase to full-time during annual school vacations.

Fordham students may seek on-campus jobs at Rose Hill, Lincoln Center, and Westchester.

**If you are an F-1 student and obtain on-campus employment and you do not have a Social Security Number**, you will need to apply for one. To apply for a Social Security Number based on your on-campus employment follow the steps below:

**Step 1. **: Work with your hiring department's supervisor to complete the [On Campus Employment SSN Request Form](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/international-services/pdfs/SSN-Application-form-Updated-2024.pdf) and submit a copy via our [SSN Online Request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdpzC_H6_r9xW-kEr52lY9iTg_MXP5lVCrtpgxI1_VLOahREw/viewform) Portal.

*(If you are a J-1 student, or on a different visa status, please contact OIS for further guidance.)*

**Step 2.** OIS will contact you regarding the pickup of a support letter that you must take to the Social Security Office -- Social Security has informed us that letters must contain our original signature, and cannot be scanned copies.

**Step 3. **Take the original Request Form (signed by your supervisor), the OIS support letter, your passport, I-20, and [I-94](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/#/recent-search) to the Social Security Office

If you’re in the U.S., you can [ apply for a Social Security number for the first time online](https://www.ssa.gov/number-card/request-number-first-time); then go to a local Social Security office to provide your documentation.
