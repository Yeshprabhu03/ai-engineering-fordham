# International Student Check In

## Online check in for F-1 and J-1 students

If you are an F-1 or a J-1, you must check in with the OIS within 10 days of your arrival at Fordham. Checking in with us is absolutely necessary and is the first thing you must do to maintain your legal status here in the U.S. You cannot check in if you are outside the US. If you do not check in, your F-1 or J-1 status will be in jeopardy.

**If you are an F-1 or J-1 student**, you must complete the check-in requirement online.

**If you are a J-1 scholar or professor**, see below under e* xceptions*.

Note: Do not check in if you are still outside the U.S. You must have entered the U.S. in order to check in!

You will be asked to upload the following documents:

- A copy of your current F-1 visa page (Canadian citizens can upload a copy of their passport)
- Your I-94 record (please see the bottom of this page for more info about the I-94 and how to retrieve it)

**Please scan and prepare all of the documents listed above before starting the online check-in to ensure the quick and smooth completion of your check-in process. Please do your best to upload them as PDF.**

We will contact you if we have any questions about your documents or your check-in form.** **

If you have any technical problems or difficulties with the check-in process, please email OIS at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9af5f3e9f4ffede9eeeffefff4eedafcf5e8fef2fbf7b4fffeef). The subject line of your email must read: **Fordham ID Number, check in question**. The subject line of your email should read:

"A12345678 check in question"

### Exceptions

If you are a J-1 scholar or professor, you must come to the OIS office (at either Lincoln Center or Rose Hill) to check in; you cannot check in online.

If you have any questions or difficulties with the check-in process for J-1 scholars, please email OIS at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0e61677d647d6d6661626f7c4e68617c6a666f63206b6a7b). The subject line of your email must read: **Family Name, First Name, Fordham ID Number, Check In Question**. For example, if your family name is Doe and your given name is John, then the subject line of your email should read:

"Doe, John, A12345678 Check In Question"

### I-94 record

The I-94 records the date and purpose of your entry into the U.S., and the length of time that you are allowed to stay here. As F-1 and J-1 students, you are allowed to stay here for as long as it takes for you to finish your studies. This is called Duration of Status (D/S). Make sure that the Admit Until Date on your I-94 says "D/S"!

The I-94 used to be a small white card that was issued to you each time you entered the U.S., and collected each time you left. Now, the officer at the airport records your entry electronically using your passport, so the I-94 record is now an electronic document.

Please [ visit this website](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/home) and click on "Get Most Recent I-94." You should print a copy for your records.

When entering your information, make sure to enter your name exactly as it appears on your passport. If you are not able to obtain your I-94, try **all** possible combinations of your name.

If you have tried all possible combinations, but cannot obtain your I-94, please contact us.**If you received a paper I-94 (small white card) upon entry, you must contact us as soon as possible**.
