# Responsibilities on Post-Completion OPT

## How to Maintain F-1 Status while on Post-Completion OPT

General Information

- While on OPT, you are still on F-1 status and OIS still oversees your SEVIS record.
- F-1 regulations require you to report employment to DHS within 10 days of the change. You can report this information through your
[SEVP Portal](https://sevp.ice.gov/opt/#/login). Regulations allow you to change employers during the period of authorized practical training as long as the new employment continues to be directly related to your field of study. - You should not be unemployed for more than 90 days during post-completion OPT
- OIS does not automatically issue I-20s for approved OPT. If you would like an updated I-20, please
You should update your I-20 travel signature every six months while on OPT.**make an online request.** - Keep evidence of employment for your records. For each employment, try to keep offer letters, pay stubs, letter describing the nature of the work and how it related to the degree program, etc.


If you are not employed

- During Post–Completion OPT, your F-1 status is dependent on employment. During the 12 months of standard post-completion OPT, a student may not be unemployed for an aggregate of more than 90 days.
- If your OPT is nearing the 90-day unemployment limit, contact OIS for guidance.
- If you are unsure about how many unemployment days you have accrued, you can reach out to

If you are employed

- You may work only within the dates that you have been authorized on your EAD.
- Access your SEVP Portal to report employment and stop the 90-day unemployment clock.
- You are required to report employment information within 10 days of change, and you can report such information through the SEVP Portal:

-
- Change of address and phone number.
- Name and address of employer.
- Change of name and/ or address of employer.
- Any interruption or change in employment.



What is the SEVP Portal

The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) Portal is a tool that lets students on OPT meet their legal reporting requirements. F-1s on OPT have direct access to this portal and can make real-time changes. This makes maintaining OPT responsibilities easier and more efficient. Once your OPT begins, you should receive an email from SEVP [[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)] with instructions to claim your SEVP portal account (check your Junk/Spam folder as well).

- If you need OIS to assist in resetting the SEVP portal password, write to
[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) - If you failed to report changes to the SEVP portal within 10 days, write to
[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#137c7a6053757c61777b727e3d767766)


Other Reporting Requirements

Since you are still an F-1 non-immigrant while you are on OPT, you are still required to report the following information to OIS within 10 days of making the change:

- Change of name (you must bring proof of your updated passport noting the change)
- Change of address (which can also be reported via the SEVP portal)
- Change in visa status
- If you choose to depart the U.S. permanently


Types of employment allowed on Post- Completion OPT

**You can only report employment through the SEVP Portal if you work for more than 20 hours per week**. If you have multiple employment where the combined working hours are more than 20 hours per week, you can report through the SEVP Portal. You should update the SEVP Portal when your combined employment hours are no longer more than 20 hours.**Employment on OPT must be related to your field of study.**- Multiple Employers: You may work for more than one employer as long as employment is related to your degree program and full time (more than 20 hours/week).
- Work for Hire: Also known as 1099; service based on a contractual relationship. Try to keep documents showing the duration of the contract periods and the name/address of the contracting company.
- Self-employment: While on OPT, you may start a business and be self-employed. Be ready to prove that you have appropriate business licenses and your business is related to your degree. Note: OIS cannot advise on “business licenses.”
- Agency or consulting firm: Try to keep evidence showing that you worked an average of more than 20 hours/week.
