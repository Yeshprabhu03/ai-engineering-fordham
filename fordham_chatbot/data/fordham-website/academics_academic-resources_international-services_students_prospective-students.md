If you have not already been accepted into a Fordham program, please follow these steps before contacting our office. **The Office for International Services is not a part of the admissions process**, and we are not able to assist students regarding visa and immigration issues until after they have been admitted to the University.

## Basic steps

[Apply to a Fordham program](https://beta.fordham.edu/undergraduate-admission/international-students/)- Receive an admittance letter from the program
- Review the
[Immigration and Visa Information](/academics/academic-resources/international-services/students/newly-admitted-students/immigration-and-visa-information/)page and follow the steps to receive a Fordham issued I-20 or DS-2019

Once you have completed the below steps, we can issue an I-20 or DS-2019 to you by email. You can choose to have the document delivered to you by express mail (at your expense), to pick the document up yourself or to authorize someone else to pick it up on your behalf. After your I-20/DS-2019 has been processed you will receive an email detailing these instructions.

Any questions related to immigration must be directed to OIS.

However, any questions related to academics and admission should be directed to the appropriate Admissions Office:
