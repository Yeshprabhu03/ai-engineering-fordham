The Olga Ficarra/Francis J. Morison Language Laboratory at Lincoln Center is a state-of-the-art multi-use, interactive digital facility consisting of self-contained computer stations, all equipped with the most up-to-date audio, recording, and film viewing technology.

A dedicated server houses all the audio and video material that is transmitted to the facility. Digital audio/recording software allows for traditional listening and recording. Students have the ability to complete their assignments and practice their language in an optimal independent study environment.
