Welcome to Fordham’s Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC). Our program, hosted at Manhattan College, serves more than 30 schools in the New York City metro area including Fordham University. As the only AFROTC detachment in New York City, our goal is to provide pre-commissioning education for qualified students who desire to serve as commissioned officers in the United States Air Force **and United States Space Force **while still enjoying a civilian college life.
