# About Air Force ROTC

AFROTC is a program that gives students the opportunity to earn scholarships and become Air Force and Space Force officers. As cadets, you will gain real world leadership training and experience that complements what you are learning in your academic classes. During our summer training programs and internships, you can literally travel the world and experience other cultures or do cutting-edge research in one of our world-class laboratories. As new second lieutenants, you become involved in flying, engineering, intelligence, space operations, financial analysis, acquisition, human resources, medicine, or law, just to name a few of our career specialties.

AFROTC provide students with the opportunity to continue the tradition of leadership and scholarship through preparation for a career as an Air Force or Space Force officer. Air Force ROTC is a college program offered at more than 1,100 campuses across the country. It prepares young men and women to become leaders, but it’s also much more. Students will grow as an individual both mentally and physically while developing lifelong friendships. They can acquire strong leadership skills that will benefit them as an Officer and in corporate America. And it’s an opportunity to pay for school through scholarships. Plus, unlike many college students, you’ll have a position waiting for you after graduation at one of the top high-tech organizations in the world — the U.S. Air Force **and U.S. Space Force**.
