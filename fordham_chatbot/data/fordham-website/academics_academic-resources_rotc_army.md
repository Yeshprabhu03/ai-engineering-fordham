# Army ROTC

The Army Reserves Officers' Training Program (Army ROTC) is one of the nation's premier leadership training programs, which prepares full-time students to receive a commission as an Officer in the United States Army while pursuing their college degree. Cadets (Students who join ROTC) attend classes, conduct physical training, and lead other Cadets as part of The Yankee Battalion. The Mission of the Yankee Battalion is to attract, educate, and inspires Cadets to provide qualified and committed candidates for Commission in the Total Army.


You may decide that you enjoy the leadership challenge, want to officially pursue a career in the Army as a leader, and compete for a “contract.” Contracts are awarded based on your physical fitness, academic standing, and performance in ROTC. You will develop your leadership skills, confidence, fitness, and professionalism in our program.

If you contract, complete our program, and finish your degree, you could be commissioned as an Army Lieutenant in the Active Duty Army. Active duty means that you would be living and working in a full-time Army environment. You could also serve in the Army Reserve or National Guard, where you would serve one weekend per month and two weeks in the summer.
