# Guide to the USACC 104-R

The United States Army Cadet Command (USACC) Form 104-R is Cadet Command's Planned Academic Program Worksheet. It is Cadet Command's and Yankee Battalion's way of tracking Cadets' academic progress throughout their academic Tenure. It acts as a "check-in" to ensure Cadets are on track to graduate. It is a requirement for all contracted cadets to provide one every semester and is a requirement for cadets who with to contract/receive a scholarship.
