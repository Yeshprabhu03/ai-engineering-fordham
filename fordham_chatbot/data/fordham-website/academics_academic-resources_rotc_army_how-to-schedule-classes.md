# How to Schedule Army ROTC Classes

A Fordham student, who has completed enrollment with the Army ROTC Recruiting Operations Office, can register for Army ROTC Classes like any other class at Fordham. For non-Fordham students most schools will not have ROTC listed in their course catalog and will not require any special or additional enrollment from you in regards. Non-Fordham students only need to ensure that their schedule is generally free on the day ROTC classes are held at your respective training campus (Fordham Rose Hill, Fordham Lincoln Center, and Marist College) and that you have completed an enrollment packet through the Recruiting Operations Officer's office.
