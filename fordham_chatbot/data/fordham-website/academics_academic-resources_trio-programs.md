Fordham University has a Talent Search program (also known as Academic Talent Search), which is part of the eight federally-funded TRIO Programs. Talent Search, the second outreach program, was created as part of the [Higher Education Act](https://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/highered/talentsearch/index.html).

The Fordham Talent Search program identifies and assists individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds who have the potential to succeed in higher education. Working in Yonkers, NY school district, the program provides academic, career, and financial counseling to its participants and encourages them to graduate from high school and continue on to and complete their postsecondary education. The program publicizes the availability of financial aid and assists participants with the postsecondary application process. The goal of Talent Search is to increase the number of youth from disadvantaged backgrounds who complete high school and enroll in and complete their postsecondary education.
