**Andrea Wilk** loves meeting students and hearing about what they’re working on and feels she’s been given a mini-education in lots of subjects she’s never formally studied. After graduating from Vassar College with a major in anthropology, she worked in book publishing, specializing in children’s books. After several years, she went back to school (Columbia) for a master’s degree in Teaching English as a Second Language and taught ESL and college writing at Fordham, Columbia, Adelphi, and St. John's. She eventually realized, however, that she preferred working one-on-one with students to classroom teaching.

Her areas of expertise are English, history, anthropology, sociology, art history, film, theater, and psychology but enjoys helping students with any and all writing assignments. She’s a New York native (she grew up about 25 blocks north of the Lincoln Center campus) and loves hearing what students from other places think of NYC. When not working, she can be found sitting on her couch reading (literary fiction, mysteries, and Holocaust memoirs are among her favorite genres), at the gym, or rambling around the streets of Manhattan.
