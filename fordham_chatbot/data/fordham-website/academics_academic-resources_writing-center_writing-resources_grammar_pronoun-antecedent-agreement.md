# Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement

The Pronouns “he,” “she,” “it,” and “they” are words that replace **nouns. Possessive pronouns** like “his,” “her,” “its,” and “their” not only replace nouns, but also signal possession.

**Sarah** went to see The Texas Chainsaw Massacre because **she** loves horror movies. (The pronoun “she” replaces the proper noun “Sarah.”)

After seeing the film, **Sarah** was too afraid to walk to **her** car alone. (The possessive pronoun “her” replaces the proper noun “Sarah” and signals her ownership of the car.)

Another name for a noun that is replaced by a pronoun is **“antecedent.”** (The prefix antemeans “before,” indicating that the antecedent comes before the pronoun.)

Pronouns and their antecedents must agree in number; for example: “**Someone** would go see The Texas Chainsaw Massacre because they love horror movies” is incorrect because the antecedent “someone” is singular, while the pronoun “they” is plural. In order to replace “someone,” we need a singular pronoun, “he” or “she.”

**Traps To Watch For **

Pronoun-antecedent agreement becomes complicated when you are dealing with **generic nouns, compound antecedents, indefinite pronouns, and co**llective nouns.

**Generic Nouns:** Generic nouns like “swimmer,” “student,” or “politician” refer to a nonspecific person within the category of “swimmers,” “students,” and “politicians.” This nonspecific person is always singular, since he or she is only one member of the group.

Every **zombie** must consume human flesh if ** they he or she** wants to live.

Each **student** should remember to take ** their his or her** garlic and sharpened stake on the camping trip.

**Compound Antecedents:** Compound Antecedents can be joined with “and” or “or/nor.” If they are joined with “and,” they should be treated as plural.

**Jason Vorhees** and **Freddy Krueger** teamed up to take revenge on ** his their** foes.

If, on the other hand, they are joined by “or/nor,” they should be treated as singular.

Either **Jason Vorhees** or **Freddy Krueger** could have succeeded if **he** had not underestimated the teenagers. **Note:** If the two nouns joined by “or/nor” are different in number, the pronoun should agree with the antecedent closest to it.

Neither **Godzilla** nor the **aliens** could escape their fate. (Notice that “their” agrees with “aliens” because “aliens” immediately precedes the pronoun.)

**Indefinite Pronouns: **Indefinite pronouns like “everyone,” “anything,” “anybody,” or “somebody” do not refer to any specific person or thing, so writers treat them as singular.

**Everyone** who sees The Exorcist is frightened out of ** their his or her** mind.

**Collective Nouns:** Collective nouns like “committee,” “senate,” or “audience” refer to a group that might act as a single unit. When such a group is acting as a single unit it is referred to in the singular.

The **audience** screamed in unison as** it** saw the zombie hordes approaching.

However, when the members of the group act individually, it is appropriate to refer to them in the plural.

The **audience** clapped **their** hands when Bruce Willis shot the zombies to pieces.

**Practice Exercise **

Underline the **antecedent** in the following examples and circle the correct **pronoun** for that antecedent.

1. The rabid vampires and hungry werewolf made its/their escape from the hunters.

2. If Hanna or Jane had seen that film she/they would have been terrified.

3. Neither the repentant assassin nor the aliens found its/their way out of the collapsing building.

4. Anybody could use his or her/their holy relic to repel the swarm of undead.

5. Every swimmer at Camp Crystal Lake lost his or her/their life because of Jason Voorhees.

6. When the army got to Washington D.C, it/they enacted a quarantine to prevent the virus from spreading further.

7. The class was armed with sporting goods and firearms it/they had stolen from various stores in the mall.
