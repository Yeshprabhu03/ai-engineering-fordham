# Comparing and Contrasting

Comparing and contrasting are a basic part of the logical process, and they also influence our rhetorical strategies.

We are constantly noting similarity and difference: a bird has wings, a plane has wings, a mansion has wings … yet are they the same? From the moment we roll out of bed in the morning to the time we crawl back at night, we are comparing and contrasting people, objects, and ideas. What clothes should you wear for class? Something warm or cool? Should you take the longer, scenic route to your job, or should you take the ugly shortcut to save time? How does your new track coach compare with your old one?

Whether we realize it or not, we are constantly asking ourselves such questions, thereby using the process of comparison and contrast to reach decisions or pass judgments on two or more objects, persons, ideas or attitudes.

**What are the ways we compare?**

There are several ways to approach the process of comparing. As an example, let’s say we are comparing the 2008 presidential campaigns of John McCain and Barack Obama. We might structure our discussion according to one of the following patterns:

Pattern 1

¶ or section 1: all about John McCain’s (JM) campaign

¶ or section 2: all about Barack Obama’s (BO) campaign

¶ or section 3: analysis of both campaigns; conclusions

Pattern 2

¶ or section 1: all about similarities between JM’s and BO’s campaigns

¶ or section 2: all about differences between JM’s and BO’s campaigns

¶ or section 3: analysis of both campaigns; conclusions

Pattern 3

¶ or section 1: all about one aspect/item in terms of both JM’s & BO’s campaigns

¶ or section 2: all about one other aspect in terms of both JM’s & BO’s campaigns

¶ or section 3: analysis of either campaign OR the two other aspects; conclusions

**Warning!**

If you choose Pattern 1, be sure to discuss the respective points in the same order in your JM and BO paragraphs. Be consistent, or you will confuse your reader.

Similarly, if you choose patterns 2, 3, or 4, be careful to avoid the “tennis match” effect as you move back and forth between JM and BO within each paragraph. Use transitions (See the Transitions Handout) effectively to avoid choppiness and confusion as you move from point to point.
