# Advanced Certificate in Health Care Ethics Curriculum

The Certificate
[program’s curriculum](/academics/centers-and-institutes/center-for-ethics-education/academic-programs/advanced-certificate-in-health-care-ethics/courses/) consists of four courses: three discipline-based courses and one capstone course. At least one of the discipline-based courses must be from a humanities discipline, and at least one must be from a social sciences discipline; the third discipline-based course may be from either a humanities or a social sciences discipline. The fourth required course is an interdisciplinary and team-taught capstone course which results in a final mentored paper on a topic related to the student’s interest. Some previous capstone paper topics include:

- "Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer (SCNT): A Scientific, Philosophical, Theological, and Practical Approach"
- "Customizing Conception: The Ethics of Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis"
- "Is That Allowed?: Stem Cells and Double Effect Reasoning"
- "Social Justice in the Provision of Health Care to the Uninsured"
- "Evaluating the Claim of a Right to Health Care in the American Political Tradition"
- "Ethical Implications Related to Hope and the Therapeutic Misconception in Clinical Trials"

Students will have the opportunity to learn from and interact with accomplished professors and students in the
[Master's Program in Ethics & Society](/academics/departments/ethics-and-society/) during the capstone course titled,
[Theories and Applications in Contemporary Ethics](/academics/departments/ethics-and-society/curriculum-and-areas-of-specialization/theories-and-applications-in-contemporary-ethics/). The Center also hosts national and international leading scholars in the area of health care ethics who deliver university-wide lectures and meet with faculty and students in the
[Center’s academic programs](/academics/departments/ethics-and-society/about/).

The program is administered under the auspices of the
[Center for Ethics Education](/academics/centers-and-institutes/center-for-ethics-education/), and may be completed within a year or at your own pace. The Center was created in 1999 to promote high-quality teaching, research, and service through the intellectual appreciation of moral values and critical thinking regarding ethical practices.
