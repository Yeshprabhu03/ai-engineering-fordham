![s](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/ethics-and-society/chynn_prize.jpg)

**Funded by the Chynn Family Foundation**

The purpose of this brief essay competition is to stimulate self-examination about concepts of ethics and morality encountered personally or as a concerned member of society.

### Essay Criteria

In 1,000 – 1,500 words, you are encouraged to raise questions, single out issues, and identify dilemmas of personal or social significance. In the Jesuit tradition of Eloquentia Perfecta, essays should analyze the ethical or moral question or issue with logical clarity. Essays may include reference to published scholarship, but must be original, unpublished work and should reflect your individual voice.

You may choose to write about questions, issues, or dilemmas that have personally impacted you, or your family or friends; that you have encountered in media or popular culture; or that you have learned about through your studies at Fordham. You are welcome to draw on a number of philosophical, theological, humanistic, and scientific perspectives, as well as your own biographical experiences. We also welcome essays that are focused around broader ethical themes, including (but are not limited to):

- Why is morality essential to leading a fulfilled and happy life?
- What are some especially salient contemporary obstacles to having a moral life, and how might those obstacles be overcome?
- How can morality be instilled as part of the education process for our youth?
- What moral responsibilities do individuals have to family members, friends, or the institutional, political or physical environments in which they live?
- How does one balance personal and social moral responsibilities?
