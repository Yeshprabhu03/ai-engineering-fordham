**MRP Title**Algorithmic Harm Reduction Practice: A Qualitative Pilot Study

**Abstract**The uses of machine learning to inform public health practice have proliferated in recent years. Emergent work has introduced algorithmic approaches to harm reduction service provision. This application examines ethical issues related to predictive modeling of future area-level overdose risk to guide targeted community outreach, relying on collaboration between data scientists and service providers. As a novel application of predictive analytics, this approach raises several considerations with respect to public health ethics and health equity promotion unique to the harm reduction context that remain underexplored in research. To begin to fill this gap, this study will assess the ethical considerations of harm reduction providers in the New York City metropolitan area. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 30 harm reduction practitioners and using thematic analytic methods, study findings will guide future integration of machine learning with harm reduction to facilitate ethical and equitable uptake of a growing approach to service provision in low-threshold community settings.

**MRP Title**Ethical Issues with Community Advisory Board Participation for People Who Use Drugs: A Qualitative Study

**Abstract**Community Advisory Boards (CABs) are frequently recommended for studies on HIV/Drug Use. However, there is little guidance, or research on, the ethical implementation of CAB processes from the perspective of those who have served on CABs as community or population representatives. This study examines this knowledge gap through 30 semi-structured one-hour interviews via Zoom with people who use drugs (PWUD) who have served as subject population representatives on CABs for illicit opioid or stimulant use. Study aims: 1) Examine how PWUD are engaged during CAB implementation processes. 2) Explore PWUD perceptions of their position and impact on science as subject population representatives. 3) Produce preliminary principles and guidelines that researchers, CAB members, and IRBs can use for designing or implementing CABs. Examining ethical practices in CAB members’ engagement from subject population representatives’ perspectives can improve CAB processes and increase the benefits of CABs for participants, researchers, and communities.

Behavior in the School of Public Health at Texas A&M University. He received his Master of Science from Oklahoma State University in Health and Human Performance and has an Interdisciplinary Ph.D. in Education Sciences with an emphasis in alcohol, tobacco, and other drug (ATOD) behavior research in Health Promotion, from the University of Kentucky. After receiving his Ph.D., he worked as research associate in the School of Social Work at Virginia Commonwealth University where he successfully created and implemented a behavioral health promotion and substance use prevention program utilizing trauma-focused cognitive-based therapy among youth in Virginia exposed to Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs). His research examines high-risk ATOD use and other risky behaviors among adolescent and young adult at-risk minority populations and underrepresented sub-groups. More recently, his focus has been on the development and implementation of tailored and relevant individual and group-based ATOD intervention programs for college students who are at risk of developing a Substance Use Disorder (SUD). Although the proportion of college students who qualify as having a SUD continues to increase, few are opting to seek professional help. He is currently leading the initiatives of a campus wide, multi-organization collaboration to restructure the way universities address high-risk substance users. His work has led him to develop an appreciation for the ethical implications of conducting research with high-risk university student substance users who pose a distinctive set of research conduct challenges. Through his Mentored Research Project, he wishes to inform future SUD and drug prevention and intervention-related research. His findings will also potentially ensure that future research and follow-up procedures are conducted in an ethical manner that directly accounts for the needs of young adults with a potential SUD and is respectful of their perspectives and expectations.

**Abstract**Alcohol

**research among U.S. college students is common, with data commonly uncovering patterns of heavy alcohol use indicative of an alcohol use disorder (AUD). Yet, college students rarely provide their perspectives about the ethics of participating in alcohol use behavioral research. The overall aim of this study is to assess, via an online survey, the ethics-related attitudes of college students at high risk of an AUD about participating in alcohol use research. The population for this study will consist of undergraduate college students aged 18-22 who are enrolled full-time (12 credit hours) at a university and meet the criteria for either "low risk” (<8) or "high risk” (8) of an AUD as determined by the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test. Findings will inform that future research is conducted in an ethical manner and directly accounts for the perspectives and expectations of participants who are identified with a potential AUD.**

**MRP Title**Evaluating and Audiovisual Intervention to Improve Competency to Consent among Young Gay and Bisexual Men (YGBM) Who Use Stimulants

**Abstract**Adequate comprehension of key trial information is necessary for informed consent to research participation. However, standard consent practices may not fully enable competent informed consent among young gay and bisexual men (YGBM) who use stimulants. This MRP will examine (i) the effect of a brief audiovisual intervention to increase competency to consent to participation in a hypothetical risk-reduction trial among young gay and bisexual men (YGBM) who use stimulants; and (ii) factors associated with competency to consent in this population. We will randomly assign 200 YGBM 16-24 years who use stimulants to standard of care (SOC, i.e., written informed consent/assent form) or our audiovisual intervention (SOC plus a brief animated video). We will compare overall competency to consent to research participation and each of its domains (i.e., understanding, appreciation, reasoning, and expressing choice) between study arms. We will also examine associations between sociodemographic (e.g., age, education level) and psychosocial factors (e.g., severity of stimulant use, sensation seeking) and competency to consent across study arms. This MRP will and evaluate approaches to enhance informed consent practices, which may enhance ethical conduct of research with YGBM who use stimulants.

**MRP Title**Rewards, Challenges, and Research Innovation: Indigenous Health Provider Experiences at a U.S. Collaborating HIV Health and Research Center in Lesotho

**Abstract**This study explores indigenous health workers' perceptions of the current and long-term impact of their work as clinicians and researchers on HIV prevention, care, and treatment. Study findings will contribute to HIV/Drug Abuse prevention research ethics practices by improving community engagement efforts, the responsiveness to local priorities, and the equitable distribution of benefits at low-resource settings with long-term, highly active research infrastructures. We will conduct thirty semi-structured interviews with health providers who have worked on HIV-related projects run through the Maseru Center of Excellence, a U.S.-sponsored health and research center in Lesotho (established in 2004). Lesotho reached the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets, with 90% of the population aware of their HIV status, 97% of those aware of their HIV status on treatment, and 92% of those on treatment virally suppressed. However, it still has an overall prevalence rate of 24.5 and an incidence rate of 8.1. Given the success, support, and ongoing benefits of being an HIV care and innovation nexus, this study explores insights from Basotho researcher clinicians that can both contribute to the ongoing work of improving HIV prevention in Lesotho and provide general lessons for similar global research-clinical settings. Aim one is to understand how clinicians perceive the effect of Center data collection processes and results of studies on their clinical work and ability to help reduce HIV risk. Aim two is to understand how clinicians describe the benefits of the Center on HIV current and long-term community assets, knowledge, cultural attitudes, and behaviors. Aim three is to understand clinician researchers' cross-cultural perspectives on the U.S. Belmont Report, the guidelines influencing the ethical protocols for the projects they implement

**MRP Title**Exploring bystander risks and benefits in HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis trials and opportunities for engagement



**Abstract**The sex partners of participants enrolled in HIV prevention trials may incur risks and benefits associated with research activities and are considered “bystanders.” Currently, there are no guidelines related to managing the risks of bystanders in HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis trials (PrEP) and researcher obligations to bystanders are unclear. This study will gather input on perceived risks and benefits of PrEP research to bystanders, and preferences for engaging male partners in the future from two groups: 1) pregnant or breastfeeding women and 2) male sex partners of pregnant or breastfeeding women. Between 10-15 women and 10-15 men, age 18+ will be interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. Community stakeholders, including pregnant or breastfeeding women, male partners, and midwives will be engaged prior to implementation of the research and during results dissemination. Results may inform future studies on whether and how to involve male partners in future HIV PrEP research.

**Title of MRP**

Consent, compensation, transparency, and confidentiality: Navigating the ethics of substance use research in police settings

**Abstract**

Police participation in research can offer invaluable insight into knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs that shape the risk environment of people who use drugs. Yet police are participants that invoke unique ethical concerns: agency heads can influence and direct a subordinate’s participation in ways that diminish informed consent; police have not traditionally been compensated for their role as research subjects; disclosures about deviation from law or policy raise acute confidentiality concerns; the ways in which proposed research benefits officers or their profession can be unclear, especially when the findings may be critical of police practice. Despite these concerns, there is no body of evidence about how police perceive this ethical terrain. To help fill this gap, qualitative interviews from up to 30 police officers will probe these issues. The knowledge gained will yield recommendations for police participatory research to empower investigators to foresee, identify, and resolve the attendant ethical dilemmas.

**Title of MRP**

Enhancing Substance Use RCTs: Experiences and Recommendations of Research Staff

**Abstract**

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing treatments for substance use disorders are increasingly conducted in healthcare settings to reflect “real-world” conditions and enhance generalizability. However, study populations of people who use drugs (PWUD) face social and structural issues that may affect their potential participation, including socioeconomic marginalization, stigma, and criminalization. RCT staff may face ethical dilemmas as they assess the extent to which the study aims and procedures adequately reflect the pressing and multifaceted needs of PWUD. In light of these challenges, this study aims to identify ethically relevant issues faced by staff working in substance use trials, through semi-structured interviews with 30 research staff. By understanding the ethical challenges that arise in research encounters from the perspectives of research staff, findings will generate practical recommendations for supporting research staff in the field, thereby improving the ethical conduct of clinical research with people who use drugs.

Ethical considerations for incorporating biometric enrollment technology into HIV and substance use research with persons who injection drugs in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico

**Abstract**

Globally, biometric identification technology [biometrics] such as finger, hand, face and iris scanners are being employed in cohort studies in order to prevent double-enrollment, streamline check-in processes and reduce data-entry errors. However, there may be consequences for studies that incorporate biometrics within enrollment procedures for people inject drugs (PWID) living along the El Paso-Ciudad Juárez Border. Ethical trade-offs surrounding biometric enrollment for future HIV prevention studies focused on PWID in resourced limited settings may include privacy concerns and potential justice issues, whereby PWID sub-groups may opt out of study participation. We aim to qualitatively assess the privacy concerns, enrollment biases and accuracy of survey responses corresponding to sensitive questions among 30 PWID. Biometric demonstrations will precede each in-depth interview to elicit participant discussion. Results will provide recommendations for future HIV and substance use cohort studies along the El Paso-Ciudad. Juárez Border and other resource-limited settings, where legal protections are scarce.

He holds a PhD in Health Behavior and an MPH in Community Health from Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington. He was a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Northwestern University Institute for Sexual and Gender Minority Health and Wellbeing. His research examines HIV prevention and care utilization and delivery determinants from an ecological perspective. His research samples adolescents and young adult sexual and gender minorities, their parents, and their healthcare providers. He focuses his research on rural populations, settings, and contexts. Although online HIV prevention and care resources exist, these online interventions primarily target urban adolescent and young adult sexual and gender minorities. There is a dearth of evidence evaluating the ethical implications of online interventions for adolescent and young adult sexual and gender minorities living in rural areas. His behavioral research seeks to account for the ethical considerations of working with and providing services to rural populations. His work has led him to encounter ethical considerations in establishing trust and community-academic partnerships with rural sexual and gender minorities, identifying effective recruitment methods for hidden populations, and creating developmentally and culturally appropriate informed consent forms for adolescent and young adult sexual and gender minorities. He is interested in the ethical dimensions of HIV linkage to care protocols in online HIV prevention interventions, especially as little to no HIV care resources exist in rural areas. His behavioral research seeks to enhance the HIV prevention and care continua within rural areas.

**Title of MRP**

The Perspectives of HIV Linkage to Care Protocols for TelePrEP Interventions among Rural Young Men Who Have Sex with Men

**Abstract**

Current telePrEP HIV linkage to care protocols do not consider the context of rural men who have sex with men (MSM). The lack of HIV care resources and high rates of HIV stigma in rural areas create challenges for telePrEP staff and MSM who are HIV-positive to link them to HIV care resources. This project will identify 30 rural MSM in Texas about their perceived risks and benefits of participating in a telePrEP intervention, perceived risks and benefits of testing HIV-positive during the initial testing of a telePrEP intervention, and preferences for HIV linkage to care protocols for a telePrEP intervention. Participants will complete a 60-minunte Zoom interview, and interview data will be analyzed using inductive framework analysis. Results from this proposal can develop telePrEP HIV linkage to care procedures that are sensitive and responsive to the lived experiences of rural MSM.

Facilitators and barriers to research assessing the use of ingestible sensors to measure PrEP adherence research among MSM with substance use disorder (TechPrEP)**Abstract**

Digital pill systems (DPS) comprised of an ingestible radiofrequency sensor integrated into a gelatin capsule overencapsulating oral pharmacotherapy for HIV pre-expsoure prophylaxis (PrEP) directly measures PrEP adherence. This real-time ingestion data leads to discovery of insights around context and interventions that address PrEP adherence. For men who have sex with men (MSM) with substance use disorders, DPS may provide a tool that enhances PrEP adherence. Despite the promise of DPS, key concerns remain around the optimal design of research studies that leverage the DPS as an adherence monitoring tool. Specifically, the interpretation of DPS adherence data and methods to ethically describe research studies to potential participants remain unknown. This mentored research program will conduct a quantitative survey to assess facilitators and barriers for MSM who use substances to utilize a DPS in PrEP adherence intervention research.

She holds a PhD in Psychology with specific training in implementation science, qualitative and mixed method research design, and measurement and intervention development. Dr. Hood’s research focuses on sexual and reproductive health outcomes among BIPOC folx and rural communities. She works with rural communities on the dissemination and implementation of community-based HIV interventions among Black women and couples. A central research aim of her work has been to find innovative ways to disseminate persuasive health messages and implement HIV interventions, thus increasing the scope of prevention efforts. To achieve this aim, Dr. Hood has been conducting grant funded, community-based interventions (NIMH, NIDA) to increase access to HIV prevention resources and care among Black women residing in rural areas. In her work, Dr. Hood uses various methods to implement and adapt evidence-based interventions, conduct assessments of fidelity, and supervise and train facilitators to deliver HIV prevention programming to BIPOC communities. One of the unique contributions of Dr. Hood’s work is the use of technology to promote health messages and interventions that are culturally relevant and demonstrated effective to rural and underserved Black communities. This work has involved the development and dissemination of HIV prevention messages through social media and other web-based tools. Dr. Hood’s work also examines stigma, discrimination, consent, and survivorship influence on sexual health and wellness.

Ethical Considerations of m-Health couples-based HIV self-testing and counseling in the South**Abstract**

Racial disparities that exist in HIV infection rates cannot be fully explained by individual-level risk behaviors. Web-based adaptations of the Couples HIV Testing and Counseling (CHTC) are ideally suited for rural African American (AA) communities and other communities who have higher levels of medical mistrust due to historical and current treatment within the healthcare system. There are a number of ethical issues that arise when adapting a web-based couples’ intervention where both partners are involved during the recruitment, informed consent, counseling, HIV testing, and treatment referral phases of an RCT. Some ethical issues include coercion related to recruitment and informed consent; the allocation of incentives; partner safety when sharing HIV testing result; confidentiality related to mobile phone security; medical mistrust, therapeutic and preventive misconception. To address these ethical concerns and better inform the adaptation of a web-version of CHTC for AA rural heterosexual couples the purpose of this study is to examine participant perspectives on ethical issues surrounding implementation of an RCT assessing the CTHC for AA partnerships living in the rural south using an m-health platform and HIV self-testing.

Developing an ethical framework for the recruitment of people who inject drugs experiencing incarceration in HIV prevention research**Abstract**

People who inject drugs (PWID) are disproportionately impacted by the HIV epidemic and by incarceration. During the period immediately after reentry into the community from incarceration, individuals including PWID are at an even greater risk of HIV acquisition. Interventions to prevent HIV acquisition, including the use of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) during the period post-release, are a promising yet understudied approach to preventing HIV acquisition. In order to improve our understanding of successfully promoting PrEP use for this uniquely vulnerable population, conducting ethically grounded research is crucial. This study aims to characterize potential approaches to recruit, enroll and reimburse individuals for participation in research activities while incarcerated at the Rhode Island Department of Corrections by conducting interviews with stakeholders in the criminal justice system. We will then explore ethical considerations related to their use, such as undue influence and coercion, during interviews with stakeholders as well as with PWID experiencing incarceration.

Risk Perception of Mobile Phone Use and Privacy Management Strategies for HIV Prevention among Female Sex Workers in Nepal**Abstract**

Female sex workers (FSWs) in Nepal continue to disproportionately experience HIV risk.This study aims to understand perceptions of privacy concerns and risks associated with mobile phones use for mHealth interventions in this population, and to understand socially and culturally acceptable strategies FSWs use to manage these risks. We also aim to assess the prevalence of the mobile phone related perceived risks, concerns, and privacy management strategies and their relationship with health care utilization. This study will recruit women 18 and above who report engaging in sex work. We will conduct 30 in-depth interviews and a survey among 200 FSWs. Qualitative data will undergo thematic analysis. Descriptive and associative analyses will be conducted for the quantitative data. This study will inform the development a training module to educate FSWs about privacy management strategies important for an HIV/STI prevention mHealth study. The training will also ensure that women understand the risk and benefits of participating in such a study, which will set precedence for conducting ethically responsible HIV research in Nepal and possibly the region.

Responses of Master of Public Health students to ethical challenges related to molecular surveillance of HIV**Abstract**

Surveillance of communicable disease is a cornerstone of public health practice. However, responsible surveillance requires a delicate balance between protecting the public’s health and protecting individuals’ private information. As the development of techniques that combine artificial intelligence with surveillance will outpace the adoption of new privacy policies, professionals will be called to recognize and articulate risks and appropriately balance these with benefits for public health. This project will examine how Master of Public Health (MPH) students recognize and respond to ethical challenges related to the surveillance of HIV and how this may relate to personal styles regarding privacy and individualism vs. collectivism. Using the *Remesh* platform, up to 400 MPH students in the United States will engage in a real-time interactive discussion about current and potential uses of HIV molecular surveillance. Analysis will examine common concerns and identify blind spots among the future public health workforce.

Ethics Issues in HIV Social Network Research Involving Persons Who Use Drugs**Abstract**

The construction of social networks in the context of HIV relies on sexual and drug use information about each network member provided by the primary participant. Consequently, social network members are considered secondary subjects of the research. Currently, there are no guidelines around ensuring the risks and benefits are being comprehended by participants, and communities are not engaged in the development of the consent process. This study will gather input from the community on perceived risks and benefits of participating in social network research (SNR) studies, and their perspectives on ideal consent language. Between 30-40 men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women who use drugs, age 18+ will be interviewed, as they are heavily impacted by HIV in the U.S. and face stigma from the medical community. Results will contribute to future research on establishing guidelines for an iterative, community-driven consent process that explicitly addresses risks unique to SNR.

Long-acting injectable PrEP research trials for MSM and transgender women of color**Abstract**

We collected responses from sexually active MSM, transgender women and gender-nonconforming people of color through an anonymous, web-based survey (N=216) to understand the facilitators and barriers to research participation in a hypothetical LAI PrEP trial. In adjusted multiple linear regression models, the following items were found to be significantly associated with research participation likelihood: ever participated in an HIV research study; comfort with taking a pill daily; comfort with providing a urine sample; and concerns over potential side effects of the shot. Asians were more concerned about others knowing they were being recruited compared to Black and Latinx respondents (F2, 216=3.98; p<0.05). Asian respondents were also less comfortable with being recruited at an organization that serves communities of color (F2, 216=5.10; p<0.05) than Black and Latinx respondents. Cisgender respondents were more comfortable with being recruited by a friend or colleague than transgender/gender-nonconforming respondents (F1,215=4.8; p<0.05).

Identifying ethical and culturally responsive activities to improve PrEP research participation among Black sexual minority men

**Abstract**

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) substantially reduces risk of HIV infection. Tele-health interventions could improve PrEP initiation and adherence for high incidence groups such as Black sexual minority men (BSMM). However, BSMM remain underrepresented in clinical trials and culturally responsive ways to improve PrEP tele-health trial participation among BSMM is needed. To fill this gap, this study identified ethical and culturally responsive study activities to improve PrEP tele-health clinical trials participation among BSMM. Data come from seven virtual, synchronous focus groups among 28 BSMM ages 18-34 were conducted from April to August 2020 to identify culturally responsive research activities to improve PrEP clinical trial research participation. Focus groups included a brief survey followed distributed online via Qualtrics™ followed by a virtual, synchronous focus group conducted via Zoom lasting between 50 and 75 minutes. Focus groups were stratified by age (18-24 vs 25-34) and outlined the components of an example PrEP tele-health randomized controlled trial and probed on domains of the study design- research motivations, study funding, recruitment activities, informed consent, randomization, follow-up, and end of the study activities. Participants were asked targeted questions regarding the ethics and trustworthiness of the study and ways that researchers could gain their trust in the PrEP tele-health trial along the protocol. Focus groups resulted in 2 groups of 18-24 year olds and 5 groups of 25-35 year olds. The average age of participants was 27.2 years (SD 4.4). Ten (38.4) reported a bachelor’s degree was their highest education completed; 21% reported some graduate degree or higher. Most reported working full-time (57.1%) and being single or not in a committed relationship (75%). Most (85.7) reported using at least one drug before sex in the 6 months prior to study. Everyone reported ever hearing about PrEP and 35% were current PrEP users. Overall, focus groups yielded themes related to how researcher intentions, study funding, recruitment activities, informed consent details, randomization, and study team interactions during and after during the study impact trust and participation. Medical/research mistrust persists among BSMM. Given the salience of medical mistrust, future studies should test the relative impact of implementing findings on research participation in a PrEP tele-health clinical trial.

Acceptability and Feasibility of HIV/STI Prevention Research with Men and Transgender People Who Attend Collective Sex Environments

**Abstract**

Collective sex venues (places where people have sex in groups or in the presence of others, such as bathhouses or sex clubs) are locations where SARS-CoV-2 transmission is likely to occur. We conducted an online survey to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among 342 sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals who had attended collective sex venues (CSV) in New York City (NYC) in the prior year. Almost 1 in 10 (9.9%) participants reported having received a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 infection or antibodies. Although a minority (27.5%) of participants reported being comfortable attending a CSV during the COVID-19 pandemic, multivariable ordinal logistic regression found that willingness was higher among participants who had taken the survey later in the pandemic (aOR = 2.90, CI95% 1.90 to 4.43), who attended CSV at higher frequencies (aOR = 1.94, CI95% 1.26 to 2.99), who used substances at CSV (aOR = 1.98, CI95% 1.22 to 3.23), and who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection or antibodies (aOR = 2.27, CI95% 1.17 to 4.39). In open survey answers, participants described reasons for or against attending CSV during the pandemic, as well as risk reduction strategies that would make them more comfortable attending (e.g., screening for test results, doing temperature checks, holding outdoor events, or restricting events to lower risk sexual practices). SGM individuals who attend CSV might be at increased risk for COVID-19. Public health officials should provide CSV organizers and attendees with guidelines on how to prevent or minimize transmission risk in the context of pandemics such as COVID-19.

Expanding HIV Testing and Prevention to Reach Vulnerable Young Women

**Abstract**

South Africa has one of the highest incidence of HIV among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW), ages 15-24, in the world. Research is needed to reduce HIV risk among AGYW, but federal regulations state that the age of consent for research purposes is 18 or older. This poses significant challenges to various stages of the research process and may limit the impact of HIV prevention research among those most vulnerable. This study explores the actual experiences of risks and benefits among young women who participated in a brief behavioral HIV prevention trial. Participants were Black African (n = 13) and Coloured (n =18) young women who were younger than 18 at the time of enrollment into the trial, but currently 18 years of age. These young women had completed the trial and had been randomized to the intervention arm while enrolled in the trial. After consent, post-trial focus group discussions (2 with Black African young women and 2 with Coloured young women) were conducted with 31 former participants of the HIV prevention randomized trial. Focus group discussions were audio-recorded and notes were taken. Focus group discussions were transcribed and then coded by two independent coders using open coding methods. Results suggest that community recruitment procedures were experienced as confidential and respectful. The parental proxy consent process was experienced as respectful and young women identified a variety of older women to consent for them. Additionally, some young women reported that if parental consent was required that they would not participate, while others reported that they would still participate. Some young women also expressed concern that their parents would try to breach their confidentiality related to their HIV, pregnancy, and drug tests results. Young women reported initial apprehension about sharing information about their sexual behavior and substance use in the group intervention sessions. However, they also reported that rapport with research staff and study procedures contributed to them feeling more comfortable in the group sessions and that they were able to open up to the group. Young women reported that the monetary vouchers were an important incentive, however, the majority of women reported that access to non-stigmatizing HIV, pregnancy, and drug testing was more important and had a larger influence on their continued participation than the voucher. These findings suggest that the experiences of young women who enrolled in this HIV prevention trial before the age of consent (using a parental proxy consent procedure) were positive. While there are some risks, the benefits seem to outweigh these risks and thoughtful research methods may address them. Also, parental proxy consent methods may be a viable alternative to parental consent, especially in studies that are related to HIV risk among young women.

Couples' perspectives on research participation involving dyadic-based HIV prevention and care in Tanzania

**Abstract**

Background: A substantial number of new HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa occur within stable couples. Biomedical prevention (pre-exposure prophylaxis, PrEP) and treatment (antiretroviral therapy, ART) can provide benefits to sexual partners and can be used to prevent infection within HIV serodiscordant couples. However, research is typically focused on individuals, not dyads, even when the intervention may directly or indirectly impact sexual partners. Gaps remain in understanding best practices for recruitment, informed consent, and intervention implementation in studies involving HIV prevention and treatment among heterosexual serodiscordant couples. This qualitative study was undertaken to understand and describe decision-making and dyadic-level influence among members of serodiscordant couples regarding (1) participation in a dyadic-based research study involving HIV self-testing and access to PrEP, and (2) utilization of PrEP and ART. Methods: This qualitative study was nested within an observational cohort study assessing the acceptability of home-based couples’ HIV self-testing and uptake of dyadic care for serodiscordant couples involving facilitated referral for HIV-positive partners and access to PrEP for HIV-negative partners. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted among a subset of study participants (n = 22) as well as individuals involved in serodiscordant relationships who chose not to participate (n = 9). Interviews focused on couples’ decision-making regarding study participation and dyadic-level influence on medication use. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and translated from Kiswahili into English. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Three major themes were identified: (1) HIV as “two people’s secret” and the elevated role of partner support in serodiscordant relationships; (2) the intersectional role of HIV-status and gender on decision-making; (3) the relational benefits of PrEP, including psychosocial benefits for the couple that extend beyond prevention. Conclusions: The study found that couples made joint decisions regarding study participation and uptake of HIVrelated medication. Relational autonomy and dyadic-level influence should be considered within research and programs involving HIV serodiscordant couples.

Purdue University

**Background**[Dr. Randy Hubach](https://hhs.purdue.edu/directory/randolph-hubach/) is an Associate Professor in the College of Health and Human Sciences at Purdue University. He holds a Ph.D. in Health Behavior from Indiana University’s School of Public Health and MPH from California State University, Fullerton. Early in his career, Dr. Hubach’s research and practice experiences included serving as PI on a federally funded community-based sexual health intervention project, developing managed care programs for local public health and mental health jurisdictions, and serving in leadership positions in multiple community health coalitions and planning processes. As a behavioral scientist and public health researcher, he has gained a practical understanding of the challenges associated with the delivery of public health programs that are scientifically sound and responsive to the needs of diverse communities.

Dr. Hubach’s research interests include using community engaged principles to address sexuality-related health disparities, sexual behavior, LGBT population health, and HIV/AIDS within urban and rural communities. Although there is an increased utilization of electronic (online and mobile) resources to conduct behavioral research, there is a dearth of evidence evaluating the ethical implication of integrating such technology into behavioral risk studies of rural men who have sex with men (MSM). In an effort to maximize the HIV care continuum within rural areas, Dr. Hubach seeks to enhance behavioral research to account for ethical considerations. This includes identifying ethical concerns of rural MSM related to the participation in electronic daily diary studies which include event-level monitoring of sexual partner-seeking, sexual event, and substance use behaviors.

Assessing the ethical concerns for participation in ecologic momentary assessment (EMA) studies in a sample of rural men who have sex with men (MSM)

**Abstract**

Although men who have sex with men (MSM) within rural communities are disproportionately impacted by HIV, limited HIV research and programmatic resources are directed to these communities within the U.S. There is a need for improved behavioral data collection methods to obtain more detailed information on the relationship between rural environments, sexual behavior, and substance use. Utilization of mobile health (mHealth) technologies, such as ecologic momentary assessment (EMA), has been advocated for; however, limited research has evaluated its utility among rural MSM. Forty MSM residing in rural Oklahoma were recruited to complete in-depth interviews related to participating online/mobile-based HIV prevention research. Men described a willingness to participate in HIV and substance use studies that use EMA methodologies for data collection; however, they raised various research-related concerns. In particular, participants indicated potential privacy and confidentiality concerns related to the use of the mobile technology-based EMA in public and the storage of data by researchers. Given the varying degree of sexual orientation and substance use disclosure by participants, rural MSM were largely concerned with being inadvertently “outed” within their communities. Men described the various strategies they could employ to protect private information and methods to minimize research risk. Study findings suggest that EMA is an acceptable research methodology for use among rural MSM in the context of HIV and sexual health information, when privacy and confidentiality concerns are adequately addressed. Input from community members and stakeholders is necessary to identify potential areas of concerns for participants prior to data collection.

Justice-Involved Youth and Caregiver Concerns about Consenting to Substance Use Treatment Research

**AbstractPurpose & Population**: The purpose of this study is to examine the reactions of justice-involved youth who are mandated to drug treatment and their legal guardians to a protocol of a randomized clinical trial. This study is the first to use an empirical research ethics methodology to examine ethically relevant attitudes of justice-involved youth and their caregivers to a treatment-research study.

**Methods**: Using a mixed methods design, this ongoing study requires youth and caregivers to complete semi-structured interviews, separately, about their perceptions of a protocol detailing a randomized controlled trial, including recruitment, study design, and disclosure of information between a research team and juvenile probation. Interview questions were written to assess attitudes toward perceived risk and benefits, privacy and confidentiality, voluntariness to participate, and coercion and undue pressure. Additionally, youth and caregivers complete measures that assess their attitudes toward the juvenile justice system, mental health treatment, and researchers.

**Participants:**The projected sample size for this study is 30 (15 caregivers and 15 youths). To date, 8 dyads and one caregiver have completed the study. Transcripts for these participants were transcribed and coded for anticipated themes.

**Results**: Preliminary results suggest participants perceive several risks to participating in a longitudinal treatment-research study, including significant burden, concerns of potential parent-child conflict, legal risk, and negative emotions (e.g., stress, worry, feeling overwhelmed). Participants also perceived benefits to participation, including improved parent-child relationship and enhanced motivation and resources. Interestingly, when participants compared the treatment conditions, benefits of the treatment as usual group were not noted but benefits of the intervention group were noted. Instead, participants focused on the risks of being placed in the non-intervention group when knowing of the possibility to be placed in the intervention group. Principles of therapeutic misconceptions, clinical equipoise, and justice were prominent as were themes of autonomy, freedom of choice, and fidelity.

**Conclusion**: Preliminary results suggest common recruitment strategies may not be perceived as a risk for coercion or undue influence; families mandated to treatment may be vulnerable for therapeutic misconception and belief that one group is inferior to the other; it may be time to reconsider RCTs as the gold standard when recruiting families mandated to treatment; it may be time to consider the “side effects” of prize-based or contingency management interventions; and as a research community, it may be time to consider giving participants more than just incentive payments for participating.

**Impact**: This MRP will provide empirical data to guide the development of consent forms for substance use treatment research with justice-involved youth and establishing relationships with juvenile probation departments for recruitment.

Ethical Considerations for HIV and GBV Research: Adolescent Perspectives on Research Participation in Mexico

**Abstract****Purpose: **Various ethical challenges arise in conducting research with female adolescents focused on the intersection of HIV/STIs and gender-based violence (GBV), especially in low-and-middle-income countries (LMIC). While female adolescents have distinctive needs that merit special consideration as research subjects, their emotional and physical development may also place them at increased risk of research harms. The proposed study seeks to identify unrecognized or unacknowledged factors that have not been adequately considered and addressed in past research. **Methods: **From December 2018 to July 2019, adolescent girls (n=30) ages 16-19 that participated in a randomized control trial centered on preventing HIV/STIs and GBV were invited to participate in in-depth interviews from two community health centers in Tijuana, Mexico. Interviews were analyzed combined approach drawing on Grounded Theory and Content Analysis. Among the eighteen adolescent girls, the median age was 17.5 years, the average level of education was 7 years, the country of origin was Mexico (internal migrants south of country). The main emergent themes associated with barriers of participating in research studies include concerns regarding confidentiality, stigma or shame of the themes covered, misunderstanding of the purpose and content of the study, and limited agency to not participate. **Conclusions: **Adolescent perspectives are needed to inform ethical research and effective health policies and interventions focused on reducing risk for HIV/STIs and GBV in Mexico and other Latin American countries.

**Background**

Dr. [Stephanie H. Cook](https://publichealth.nyu.edu/faculty/stephanie-cook) aims to understand the pathways and mechanisms linking attachment, minority stress, and health among disadvantaged individuals. She examines how the inter- and intra- personal features of close relationships influence the health of racial/ethnic and sexual minorities.

Through her development of an integrated theory of adult attachment (i.e., the development, or lack, of strong socio-emotional bonds) and minority stress (i.e., social stress experienced by individuals in minority social groups), she seeks to better understand the poor health and HIV prevention needs of disadvantaged youth transitioning into adulthood. She then utilize this theoretical framework of attachment and minority stress to inform effective prevention programs for vulnerable racial/ethnic and sexual minority youth transitioning to adulthood. As the Principal Investigator and Director of the Attachment and Health Disparities Research Lab, her team assesses the association of attachment-related functioning on health disparities among racial/ethnic and sexual minority youth. Dr. Cook is first exploring how adult attachment orientation is associated with HIV risk in a community sample of Black gay and bisexual men transitioning into adulthood. Second, she illustrates how transitions in attachment during adolescence are associated with trajectories of depression among a community based cohort sample of African-American youth. Third, she seeks to understand how adult attachment, in the context of minority stress, is associated with biomarkers of physical health. Dr. Cook teaches Global Issues in Social and Behavioral Health and Regression and Multivariate Analysis. At the [Center for Health, Identity, Behavior, and Prevention Studies](http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/appsych/chibps), she conducts research and has published numerous peer-reviewed articles.

Assessing Perceptions of Broad Consent Concerning Biological Specimen Collection in a Cohort of Young Sexual Minority Men

**Abstract**

Objectives: 1) To determine the extent to which young sexual minority men (YSMM) are comfortable with providing broad consent concerning their identifiable biological specimens to a variety of entities, including external researchers and pharmaceutical companies; and 2) to examine the relationship between mistrust based on racial/ethnic identity or sexual orientation and attitudes toward broad consent. Methods: 239 YSMM ages 24-27 were recruited from a prospective cohort study in New York City in 2018 to complete a survey assessing attitudes about the use of broad consent concerning biospecimens for secondary research. Results: Participants were most willing to provide broad consent to the researcher from the study they were enrolled in (85.3%), other researchers within the same university (82.4%), and researchers at other universities (74.5%). Participants were least willing to provide broad consent to government organizations (64.4%) and pharmaceutical companies (53.8%).

Examining barriers and motivators to research participation among YBMSM HIV positive substance users

**Abstract**

HIV Seropositive BMSM who use illegal drugs are often recruited to participate in research studies conducted by large urban universities affiliated with medical centers. One body of research suggests that a history of medical discrimination and group stigma combined with research mistrust is a barrier to participation. Nonetheless many agree to participateand questions remain as to what motivates their participation decision. Perceptions of personal and community benefits of research may be one factor influencing agreement to participate. A second factor may be the influence of offering incentives (monetary or other gifts) for research participation or conducting recruitment or implementation at sites where individuals receive HIV medical care. Such influences can be seen as fair compensation for research participation or as a coercive influence that undermines voluntary choice. This project will examine the intersecting influences of research mistrust, perceived participation personal and group benefits, and the fair versus coercive influence of monetary and medical incentives on research participation among young black men who have sex with men.

Emotional Distress Among Frontline Research Staff in Low Resource Setting

**Abstract**

HIV and substance use research frequently deals with sensitive topics. A growing body of evidence suggests that frontline researchers who elicit or process participant’s traumatic experiences are themselves at risk of developing emotional distress or secondary trauma from daily immersion in these data. This both threatens a study’s data quality and calls into question how the harms and benefits of conducting research are distributed across a study team. The MRP is an exploratory, qualitative study with 21 frontline research staff in Swaziland (qualitative interviewers, quantitative survey administrators, and transcriptionists). After conducting thematic analyses, we identified four primary themes: (1) The structural context, which influences both staff’s employment opportunities and the likelihood that an informant’s traumatic life experiences will mirror similar experiences in the staff member’s friend or family network; (2) The level of emotional labour and empathy necessary in frontline research likely create simultaneous risk; (3) Relationships are both a coping mechanism and a site of harm by the research; (4) Feeling invisible or inconsequential. Overall, informants described experiencing emotional distress due both to the content of their work – particularly study participants’ experiences of poverty and poor health with which study staff deeply empathize – as well as the structure. While not all study teams may have access to formal mental health services, several informants did recommend bringing a trained counselor in to speak study teams at least occasionally. Others recommended building time for team-building or debriefing conversations into the normal workweek, a strategy that would address both the issue of workload and could bolster the already existent strategy of relying on team members for mental health support.

Exploring the Concerns of Ethnic Minority MSM living with HIV on Research Using Mobile Technology to Support Antiretroviral Therapy Adherence and Relapse Prevention in the Context of Methamphetamine Use

**Abstract**

Background: Methamphetamine use poses a barrier to antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence. Black and Hispanic men who have sex with men living with HIV (PLWH) shoulder much of the health burden resulting from the methamphetamine and HIV syndemic. Smartphones are nearly ubiquitous in the USA and may be promising vehicles for delivering interventions for ART adherence and drug use cessation. However, the acceptability of using applications to collect sensitive information and deliver feedback in this population has not been adequately explored. Objective: This study examined minority PLWH’s appraisals of the risks of participating in smartphone-based research to promote ART adherence in the context of methamphetamine use and explored their views on appropriate steps to mitigate perceived risks of participation. Methods: Three focus groups were conducted among Black and Hispanic PLWH who use methamphetamine. Of the 13 participants, 5 had previously participated in a smartphone-based observational study of ART adherence and substance use. Discussants provided feedback on smartphone-based research, including receiving probes for HIV medication adherence, mood, and substance use as well as feedback on passive location-tracking for personalized messages. Transcribed audio-recordings were thematically coded and analyzed using the qualitative software MAXQDA. Results: Participants expressed confidentiality concerns related to potential unintentional disclosure of their HIV status and methamphetamine use and to possible legal consequences. They additionally expressed concerns around the invasiveness of daily assessments and the potential of methamphetamine use questions to trigger cravings. To mitigate these concerns, they suggested maintaining participant privacy by indirectly asking sensitive questions, focusing on positive behaviors (e.g., number of days sober), allowing user-initiated reporting of location to tailor messages, and ensuring adequate data protections. In addition to financial compensation, participants cited altruism (specifically, continuing a tradition of volunteerism in HIV research) as a motivator for potentially engaging in such research. Conclusions: Minority PLWH have concerns regarding the use of smartphones for ART adherence and methamphetamine sobriety intervention research. However, minority PLWH are likely to participate if studies include appropriate protections against risks to confidentiality and experimental harm and are designed to offer future benefit to themselves and other PLWH.

Attitudes of young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) toward recruitment for HIV prevention studies

**Abstract**

Research recruitment, eligibility, and who chooses to participate shape the resulting data and knowledge, which together inform interventions, treatment, and programming. Patterns of research participation are particularly salient at this moment given emerging biomedical prevention paradigms. This paper explores the perspectives of Black and Latino young men who have sex with men (BL-YMSM) regarding research recruitment and eligibility criteria, how their experiences influence willingness to enroll in a given study, and implications for the veracity and representativeness of resulting data. We examine inclusion and recruitment as a complex assemblage, which should not be reduced to its parts. From April to July 2018, we conducted in-depth interviews with 30 BL-YMSM, ages 18–29, in New York City. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using the constant comparative method. Black and Latino YMSM’s responses unveiled tensions between researchers’, recruiters’, and participants’ expectations, particularly regarding eligibility criteria (e.g. age, sex frequency), assumptions about ‘risky behaviors,’ and the ‘target’ community. Men preferred peer-to-peer recruitment, noting that most approaches miss key population segments. Findings highlight the need to critically examine the selected ‘target’ community, who sees themselves as participants, and implications for data comprehensiveness and veracity. Study eligibility criteria and recruitment approaches are methodological issues that shape knowledge production and the policies and programs deployed into communities. These findings can inform how future research studies frame recruitment and eligibility in order to better meet the needs of participants and ensure future research engagement.**MRP Publications****Philpin, M.M.**, Guta, A., Wurtz, H., Kinnard, E.N., Bradley-Perrin, I., & Goldsamt, L.

Appraisal of risks and benefits in HIV cure studies and the role of altruism

**Abstract**

HIV cure research carries serious risks and negligible benefits. We investigated how participants understand these risks and what influences their willingness to participate. Through internet-based and in-person convenience sampling, 86 HIV+ participants completed an experimental survey. Participants were randomized to read a standard consent form describing a hypothetical HIV cure study or one adapted using Fuzzy Trace Theory—a decision-making model to facilitate complex information processing. We measured consent understanding and cognitive (e.g., safe/harmful) and affective (e.g., concerning, satisfying) evaluations of HIV cure research. Participants who read the adapted consent form had improved consent understanding, but only positive affective evaluations were associated with a willingness to participate. Consent processes can use decision-making theories to facilitate comprehension of study information.

Establishing Trust Among People Who Inject Drugs (PWID) Enrolled in a Community Health Study of Social Networks and Risk in Rural Puerto Rico

**Abstract**

The establishment of trust between researchers and participants is critical to advance HIV and HCV prevention particularly among people who inject drugs (PWID) and other marginalized populations, yet empirical research on how to establish and maintain trust in the course of community health research is lacking. This paper documents ideas about trust between research participants and researchers amongst a sub-sample of PWID who were enrolled in a large, multi-year community health study of social networks and HIV/HCV risk that was recently conducted in rural Puerto Rico. Qualitative research was nested within a multi-year *Social Network and HIV/HCV Risk* study involving N = 360 PWID > 18 years of age living in four small, rural Puerto Rican communities. Semi-structured interviews were conducted between March 2017 and April 2017 with a subset of 40 active PWID who had been enrolled in the parent study. Interview questions invited participants to draw upon their recent experience as research participants to better understand how PWID perceive and understand participant-researcher trust within the context of HIV/HCV-related epidemiological research. Fear of police, stigma and concerns regarding confidentiality and anonymity were identified as structural factors that could compromise participation in HIV/HCV-related research for PWID. While monetary compensation was an important motivation, participants also valued the opportunity to learn about their HIV/HCV status. During their participation in the study, gaining knowledge of safe injection practices was perceived as a valuable benefit. Participant narratives suggested that PWID may adopt an incremental and ongoing approach in their assessment of the trustworthiness of researchers, continuously assessing the extent to which they trust the research staff throughout the course of the research. Trust was initially generated through peer Respondent Driven Sampling recruitment. Research staff who maintained a presence in the community for the entire duration of the prospective study reinforced trust between participants and the research team. Although PWID face numerous structural barriers to research-related trust in HIV/HCV research, we found that using a peer-based recruitment method like RDS, and employing a research staff who are knowledgeable about the targeted population, culturally sensitive to their needs, and who maintain a long-term presence in the community may help mitigate many of these barriers. The reputation of the research is built incrementally as participants join the study. This contributes to a “street reputation” that grows as current or former participants vouch for the study. Establishing trust was identified as only the first step towards building a collaborative relationship with participants, and our findings suggest that steps to address criminalization and stigmatization also are necessary to support research trust.

Agency in Photovoice Research: Exploring the lived experience of persons who inject drugs

**Current Project Description**

Photovoice collaborations are designed to promote critical consciousness and advocate for change. People who inject drugs (PWID) are systematically silenced from advocacy for fear of being “outed.” Photovoice protocols that prohibit identifying photography provide a safer alternative; however, it is not known how these protections affect participant experience. This study examined how human subjects’ protections affect PWID experience in a Photovoice research project. A purposeful sample of PWID (*N* = 25) was recruited from a Photovoice study and engaged in semi-structured interviews. Interview transcripts were coded and analyzed for key themes. The majority of participants understood the protections while also explaining the difficulty in achieving their vision. Creativity played a significant role in overcoming the restrictions. A vocal minority voiced strong objections to the restrictive protocol. Allowing only anonymous photography posed certain challenges, but PWID valued the inherent privacy. Creative approaches may aid in overcoming restraints and achieving a balance.

Stigma and Ethical Concerns Related to Interviewing Women with Incarceration and Drug Use Experiences

**MRP Abstract**

While current ethical procedures aim to minimize risks to imprisoned individuals, there is heightened awareness of the need to protect those who participate in research post-incarceration while under community-based supervision. Formerly incarcerated women, in particular, face myriad challenges to community reintegration which also make them vulnerable participants in research. As such, this study explores how 28 formerly incarcerated Black women experience the qualitative research process. Findings revealed that women engaged in research because these contexts were viewed as therapeutic spaces for raising awareness that can help others. Moreover, the interview process allowed women to share their pasts in ways that promote their recovery from addiction. Participants also reported risks of emotional distress and fears regarding researcher stigma. The implications for trauma-informed interviewing practices underscore the need for greater considerations of the role of the researcher, research environment, and how they contribute to one’s personal recovery.

**Background**

Dr. [Kimberly Nelson](https://www.bu.edu/sph/profile/kimberly-nelson/) earned her MPH in epidemiology from the University of Washington (UW) and a Ph.D. in clinical psychology also from UW. Following receipt of her doctoral degree in August 2014, she was awarded a NIMH-funded postdoctoral fellowship in child/adolescent bio-behavioral HIV research (PI: Brown, T32MH078788) at Rhode Island Hospital as a part of the Clinical Psychology Consortium Postdoctoral Training Program at Brown University. Having both a public health and psychology background, Dr. Nelson focuses on community- and population-level health implications while conducting individual-level behavioral research. Her research to date has primarily concentrated on psychological and structural factors associated with the transmission or acquisition of HIV among sexual and racial/ethnic minority populations, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM). During her employment and graduate education she coordinated multiple NIH-funded HIV and substance use prevention trials targeting adult MSM (PI: Dilley, R01MH065138; PI: Dilley, R01MH073425; PI: Humfleet, P50DA009253) and conducted a two-phase, mixed-methods, NIMH-funded (F31MH088851) study on sexually explicit online media use and sexual risk-taking among adult MSM. Dr. Nelson’s current work focuses on media influences on risk behaviors among sexual minority adolescents. She is funded by a career development award from NIMH (K23MH109346) during which she will develop an online sexual health media literacy intervention to promote adolescent sexual minority males’ critical examination of online media and decrease their sexual risk-taking. Ultimately she hopes to develop HIV prevention interventions – using new and increasingly accessible and influential online media – to address disparities among sexual minority populations across key developmental periods.

Developing methods to promote the sexual health and protect the welfare of adolescent males who are interested in sex with males in the United States

**Abstract**

Institutional review boards (IRBs) that refuse to grant waivers of guardian permission may hinder research to inform needed online sexual health interventions for adolescent males interested in sex with males (AMSM). Information on the challenges of obtaining (or waiving) guardian permission is imperative. In June and July 2017, AMSM (*N* = 206; ages 14 to 17) in the United States completed an online survey on sexual behaviors, sexually explicit media use, and sexual education exposure/needs. A mixed-methods approach assessed attitudes toward guardian permission for the current survey *and* future online sexual health intervention research. Logistic regression models assessed differences by “outness” to a guardian. A framework matrix analysis was conducted to summarize, then aggregate, qualitative responses. Findings indicated that most AMSM would not participate if guardian permission was required (current: 83%; future: 87%). Youth who were not out were more likely to say they would not participate (current: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2 to 6.8); future: AOR = 4.7, 95% CI: 1.6 to 13.5). Participants reported that guardian permission would be an invasion of their privacy, lead to involuntary outing, and endanger participants. Overall, guardian permission appears to be a barrier to AMSM participation in online sexual health research. Investigators and IRBs should consider alternative practices and policies to facilitate such research.

Examining Privacy Concerns and Trust in the Context of Online and Mobile Research with Men who have Sex with Men

**Abstract**

Background: Modern research is heavily reliant on online and mobile technologies, which is particularly true among historically hard-to-reach populations such as gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM). Despite this, very little empirical research has been published on participant perspectives about issues such as privacy, trust, and data sharing. Objective: The objective of our study was to analyze data from an online sample of 11,032 GBMSM in the United States to examine their trust in and perspectives on privacy and data sharing within online and mobile research. Methods: Participants were recruited via a social networking site or sexual networking app to complete an anonymous online survey. We conducted a series of repeated measures analyses adjusted for between-person factors to examine within-person differences in the following: (1) trust for guarding personal information across different venues (eg, online research conducted by a university vs. an online search engine); (2) privacy concerns about 12 different types of data for three distinct data activities (ie, collection by app owners, anonymous selling to third parties, and anonymous sharing with researchers); and (3) willingness to share those 12 different types of data with researchers. Due to the large sample size, we primarily reported measures of effect size as evidence of clinical significance. Results: Online research was rated as most trusted and was more trusted than online and mobile technology companies, such as app owners and search engines, by magnitudes of effect that were moderate-to-large (ηpartial2=0.06-0.11). Responding about 12 different types of data, participants expressed more concerns about data being anonymously sold to third-party partners (mean 7.6, median 10.0) and fewer concerns about data being collected by the app owners (mean 5.8, median 5.0) or shared anonymously with researchers (mean 4.6, median 3.0); differences were small-to-moderate in size (ηpartial2=0.01-0.03). Furthermore, participants were most willing to share their public profile information (eg, age) with researchers but least willing to share device usage information (eg, other apps installed); the comparisons were small-to-moderate in size (ηpartial2=0.03). Conclusions: Participants reported high levels of trust in online and mobile research, which is noteworthy given recent high-profile cases of corporate and government data security breaches and privacy violations. Researchers and ethical boards should keep up with technological shifts to maintain the ability to guard privacy and confidentiality and maintain trust. There was substantial variability in privacy concerns about and willingness to share different types of data, suggesting the need to gain consent for data sharing on a specific rather than broad basis. Finally, we saw evidence of a privacy paradox, whereby participants expressed privacy concerns about the very types of data-related activities they have likely already permitted through the terms of the apps and sites they use regularly.

Emerging Adults’ Risk-Benefit Experiences with Using mHealth Technologies for Research on Drug Use and Sexual Behaviors

**MRP Abstract**

To inform ethical procedures for human subjects research using mobile health (mHealth), we examined perceived risks and benefits of study participation among emerging adults (*N *= 54) with drug use who completed text message assessments of substance use and sexual behaviors. Most participants reported comfort with participation and some reported perceived benefits, such as improved relationships. Perceived risks were infrequently reported, including negative emotions and legal or financial concerns. In conclusion, participants from a vulnerable population reported few perceived harms of participation in longitudinal mHealth assessments of sensitive behaviors. Researchers should continue characterizing participants’ perspectives on ethical aspects of mHealth research.

Perceptions of Facilitators and Barriers to Consenting Daughters Participation in HIV Prevention Research among African American Women Living with HIV/AIDS

**Abstract**

African American women living with HIV (WLWH) in the U.S. South encounter heightened marginalization due to the complex intersections of race, gender, poverty, and HIV status. Social vulnerabilities experienced by individuals and communities in daily life have the potential to sharpen ethical tensions in the context of research. Thus, conducting ethical research requires attention to the contextual challenges and concerns of diverse research populations to tailor participant protections to a particular sociocultural context. Using principles from the Belmont Report, the present report draws on data from a qualitative study with 42 African American WLWH in the South by highlighting the first author's accounts of ethical challenges that emerged during data collection. Findings suggest that engaging participants in their natural environments can inform the development of ethical research strategies germane to women's lived experiences. Study findings also contribute to empirical guidance for investigators engaging marginalized populations in scientific research.

Benefits and barriers to continued HIV treatment for drug using individuals (largely crack cocaine) who have participated in an HIV intervention study in El Salvador

**Abstract**

There is limited research on the effectiveness of social network-based community-level HIV risk reduction behavioral interventions in non-injection drug users in underdeveloped countriesand the risks and benefits encountered. In addition, there is a dearth of research on participants’ expectations and motivations to participate.The purpose of the study was to retrospectively assess the research experiences of crack users who took part in such an intervention. Seventy-eight surveys and 20 in-depth interviews were conducted to assess participants’ motivations to participate, perceived drawbacks of participation, and behavior change intentions and perceived sustainability of behavior change.Participants were recruited from a larger study assessing the effectiveness of an HIV risk reduction multi-level community based intervention. Findings indicated that participants were motivated to participate for a variety of reasons including a desire to help others (altruistic motive). Participants scored higher than the midpoint of the scale regarding perceived benefits of participating.Findings indicated that participants who felt trust towards research experienced greater benefits of participation and reduced drawbacks. Furthermore, measures of structural barriers to behavior change such as stigma towards crack use significantly influenced research trust. Approximately half of participants were motivated to participate in medical treatment, which points to the importance of utilizing alternative methods of teaching potential participants about the benefits of research participation. Findings will inform the development of guidelines to inform IRB decision-making regarding the risk/benefit ratio of participation in such interventions.

Ethical Considerations for the Collection of Spatial Data for HIV Prevention Research among Illicit Drug Users

**Abstract****Background**: Analyses with geographic data can be used to identify "hot spots" and "health service deserts", examine associations between proximity to services and their use, and link contextual factors with individual-level data to better understand how environmental factors influence behaviors. Technological advancements in methods for collecting this information can improve the accuracy of contextually-relevant information; however, they have outpaced the development of ethical standards and guidance, particularly for research involving populations engaging in illicit/stigmatized behaviors. Thematic analysis identified ethical considerations for collecting geographic data using different methods and the extent to which these concerns could influence study compliance and data validity. Methods: In-depth interviews with 15 Baltimore residents (6 recruited via flyers and 9 via peer-referral) reporting recent drug use explored comfort with and ethics of three methods for collecting geographic information: (1) surveys collecting self-reported addresses/cross-streets, (2) surveys using web-based maps to find/confirm locations, and (3) geographical momentary assessments (GMA), which collect spatiotemporally referenced behavioral data.** Results**: Survey methods for collecting geographic data (i.e., addresses/cross-streets and web-based maps) were generally acceptable; however, participants raised confidentiality concerns regarding exact addresses for illicit/stigmatized behaviors. Concerns specific to GMA included burden of carrying/safeguarding phones and responding to survey prompts, confidentiality, discomfort with being tracked, and noncompliance with study procedures. Overall, many felt that confidentiality concerns could influence the accuracy of location information collected for sensitive behaviors and study compliance **Conclusions**: Concerns raised by participants could result in differential study participation and/or study compliance and questionable accuracy/validity of location data for sensitive behaviors.

Study of voluntariness of consent to research for female participants in Clinic-Based Intervention Research in Kolkata, India

**Abstract**

A core ethical principal in research is voluntary participation. Voluntariness is ensured through the informed consent process, in which research participants receive detailed information about study procedures, risks, and benefits; are informed of their rights as research participants; and are given the opportunity to decide – without penalty or coercion – whether or not to participate in a research study. Unfortunately, there are at least two potentially significant barriers to this process, many of which are apparent in the developing world. First, literacy levels (both reading levels and levels of scientific literacy required to understand the research process) are often low among resource-limited groups, thus raising questions regarding the capacity of potential research participants to understand the informed consent process. Second, cultural barriers might impact the ability of an individual to provide informed consent. For example, the informed consent process assumes that an individual makes the decision of whether or not to participate in a research project. However, in many cultures important decisions are made by other family or community members, or are made collectively. While these decision-making processes reflect community norms, they are in direct conflict with the autonomy of potential research participants that is embedded in the informed consent process. These potential barriers to informed consent can be seen in the patient population at Medical College & Hospital, Kolkata, which is located in Kolkata, India. This hospital operates a large clinic for HIV+ patients, where clinical care (including antiretroviral medication, ART) is provided free of charge. Within the hospital, medical and social science research is regularly conducted, overseen by local and state internal review boards. A research project will be conducted soon on trial of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for non-ART adherent patients at ART centre in collaboration with Psychiatry department. Patients who enroll in this research project will first complete an informed consent process. This proposed study will assess the degree of voluntariness of this informed consent process prior to the initiation of CBT. A community advisory board will provide input on measures and research design. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with 60 Bengali-speaking women who have provided informed consent but not yet begun therapy. Findings will be reviewed by focus groups of women, men and link workers to help contextualize results and make recommendations to improve the informed consent process for future research studies.

Young men’s perspectives on the ethical issues of participating in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to prevent HIV in Tanzania

**Abstract **

The effectiveness of peer leaders in promoting health may depend on the position they occupy within their social networks. Using sociocentric (whole network) and behavioral data from the intervention arm of a cluster-randomized HIV prevention trial in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, we used generalized linear models with standardized predictors to examine the association between heath leaders’ baseline structural network position (i.e., in-degree and betweenness centrality) and their 12-month self-reported (1) confidence in educating network members about HIV and gender-based violence (GBV) and (2) number of past-week conversations about HIV and GBV. As in-degree centrality increased, leaders reported fewer HIV-related conversations. As betweenness centrality increased, leaders reported greater number of conversations about GBV. Network position was not significantly associated with confidence in discussing either topic. Our results suggest that peer leaders who occupy spaces between sub-groups of network members may be more effective in engaging their peers in sensitive or controversial topics like GBV than more popular peer leaders.

Post-trial access of Truvada® amongst HIV-1 discordant couples enrolled in the PrEP study in Kisumu, Kenya

**Abstract**

Purpose: Recent studies have shown that Truvada is effective in preventing HIV infections in most at risk populations. However, Truvada has not been provided to the participants who were enrolled in the Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) study in Kisumu, Kenya. Who is responsible for post-trial access (PTA) in this population? This is a critical ethical issue that needs to be addressed. The main goal of this study was to examine attitudes regarding post-trial access to Truvada amongst a random sample of sero-discordant couples previously enrolled in the PrEP study in Kisumu, Kenya as well as the principal investigators of the study. Study population: HIV uninfected participants in discordant relationships formerly enrolledin PrEP study, investigators of the study, and head of HIV preventative services for the Ministry of Health, Kenya. Method: Mixed methods cross-sectional study. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were conducted. A brief questionnaire was administered to capture data on socio-demographics and trial experiences. Results and Conclusion:A total of 40 participants were enrolled into the study, with 95% currently living with their partners. The majority of participants (60%) are inpolygamous relationships. Over half the participants (57%) fear-getting HIV infected since they are not receiving TRUVADA. From the FGD, most of the participants strongly felt that they should be receiving TRUVADA as they “risked their lives during study participation”. The government of Kenya and the sponsors should dialogue on how these drugs will be made available to the study population. Local investigators felt that the government should take up the responsibility of PrEP provision to high risk populations such as MSM, FSW and sero-discordant couples who are trying to conceive.

Assessing the role of stigma on women’s participation in and perceptions of intimate partner violence research

**Abstract**

African American women living with HIV were asked to reflect on the perceived risks and benefits of research participation after completing a study examining socially sensitive issues in their lives, including intimate partner violence (IPV) and HIV. Administration of standardized quantitative instruments yielded positive responses to the research experience. However, qualitative assessments of perceived risks and benefits revealed more nuanced responses. For example, confidentiality concerns were more prominent in open-ended responses as was participants’ positive attitudes toward monetary compensation. In addition, some women reported that study participation provided them with new insights about their experiences with IPV. Findings suggest that empirical studies on research protections involving potentially distressing and socially sensitive experiences with vulnerable populations require both quantitative and qualitative assessments of perceived risks and benefits. We discuss implications of our findings for ethics practices in trauma-related research among populations with multiple social vulnerabilities.

**Background**[Dr. Alexis Roth](http://drexel.edu/dornsife/academics/faculty/Alexis%20Roth/) worked in a variety of community-based organizations prior to embarking on her graduate training. Across these positions, she worked to link individuals to sexually transmitted infection (STI) and HIV testing, medical care, and social services to decrease their likelihood of acquiring/transmitting communicable diseases. She pursued a Ph.D. to address how individual, dyadic, and neighborhood-level factors contribute to health disparities. Over time, she became increasingly interested in “mHealth research” as a mechanism for measuring event-level behavioral phenomenon and capturing information about high- and low-risk activity spaces. She completed a Predoctoral Research Fellowship sponsored by the Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis Center for Urban Health to use smartphone-delivered digital diaries to measure how situational factors (e.g., drug craving; mood; relationship to sexual partner; day, time, or location of sex) impact HIV risk among women engaging in transactional sex. In 2012, Dr. Roth began an NIDA-funded postdoctoral fellowship (T32 DA 023356) in the Division of Global Public Health at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). At UCSD, her interest in mHealth research intensified as she began to consider how drug use impacts adherence to antiretroviral treatment among persons who inject illicit drugs. In September 2014, she joins the Department of Community Health and Prevention at Drexel University as Assistant Professor. In Philadelphia, she will utilize a community-engaged research approach to design and evaluate intervention studies for STIs, HIV, and drug abuse-related disparities.

Ethical considerations for mHealth research with persons who inject drugs

**Abstract**

“mHealth” research, which leverages the increasingly sophisticated capabilities of mobile communications technology for measurement and intervention in health research and care, offers a novel opportunity to measure and intervene in real time. As a new field of inquiry, researchers have yet to articulate best-practice guidelines for working with vulnerable populations (e.g. persons who inject drugs, hereafter PWIDs). PWIDs who reported using greater than 1 drug at least weekly (heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, benzodiazepines, marijuana or alcohol) who live in Philadelphia and San Diego were enrolled into a one visit study in which they completed multiple simulations of the diary instrument and a qualitative interview regarding the experience. Interviews assessed ethical biomedical research principles. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and are currently being analyzed. Our thematic analysis includes structured and emergent codes that are being applied to the transcripts. At this point in the analysis participants identified few, if any, harms related to participation in the EMA study and all reported potential benefits associated with participation. Participants provided insights into processes for participant selection to be fair while maximizing data collection for the study protocol, and on how to maximize the risk-benefit ratio. Results from this project will be used to develop a future cell phone diary study of injection drug use and to establish best-practice guidelines for other researchers interested in using mHealth tools with populations who engage in illegal behavior.

Fair Access to effective Interventions in Research trials (FAIR study): A qualitative study

**Abstract**

Background: Given the efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), there is ongoing debate regarding whether future placebo-controlled biomedical HIV prevention trials are ethically justifiable. Several innovative trial designs are under consideration to test new biomedical HIV prevention modalities provide PrEP as part of the standard of prevention or use PrEP as an active control. However, little is known about the ethical considerations of these designs. Methods: We purposively sampled and conducted in-depth interviews with 22 experts in clinical research methods and ethics. These experts included 6 principal investigators, 2 biostatisticians, 4bioethicists, 4 community advocates, 4 representatives of funding agencies, and 2 social scientists, each with experience in HIV prevention trials. We sought to understand potential trial designs for HIV vaccines or long-acting PrEP that have been under consideration, and identify preferences among these designs. We analyzed interview transcripts using constant comparative methods to inductively develop and refine themes. Results: Respondents outlined tensions to providing oral PrEP, and generally agreed it should be offered as the standard prevention in future biomedical HIV prevention trials. Key tensions included practical challenges to providing PrEP as the standard of prevention. Respondents also outlined opportunities for addressing these challenges through adaptive trial designs. Conclusions: Given the challenges and opportunities of incorporating oral PrEP as part of future clinical trials, adaptive trial designs, which allow for modification of a trial in response to study data, were highly acceptable to respondents. However, adaptive trials create new bioethical and biostatistical challenges. If adaptive HIV prevention trials are implemented, research ethics studies should focus on how to mitigate undue influence and enhance research literacy.

Ethics and Social Networking for HIV Research

**Abstract**

Social media technologies have become increasingly useful tools for research-based interventions. However, participants and social media users have expressed ethical concerns with these studies, such as risks and benefits of participation, as well as privacy, confidentiality, and informed consent issues. This study was designed to follow up with and assess experiences and perceptions of ethics-related issues among a sample of 211 men who have sex with men who participated in the Harnessing Online Peer Education (HOPE) Peru study, a randomized controlled HIV prevention intervention conducted in Peru. We found that after adjusting for age, highest educational attainment, race, sexual orientation, and prior HIV research experience, participants in the intervention group were more likely than those in the control group to have safe sex (*p* = 0.0051) and get tested for HIV regularly (*p* = 0.0051). As a result of their participation, those in the intervention group benefited more positively than participants in the control group in improving HIV care (*p* = 0.0077) and learning where to receive sexual health services (*p* = 0.0021). Participants in the intervention group expressed higher levels of comfort than those in the control group in joining and seeing other people in the Facebook group (*p* = 0.039), seeing other people’s posts (*p* = 0.038) and having other group members talk to them online (*p* = 0.040). We discuss the implications of these results as they relate to social media-based HIV research.

Consent Preparedness for Home-Based HIV Testing Research in Rural Appalachia

**Abstract**

This study sought to assess barriers and enhance readiness to consent to home and Planned Parenthood HIV testing among 60 out-patients from a mental health and substance abuse clinic in rural Appalachia. Testing barriers included not knowing where to get tested, lack of confidentiality, and loss of partners if one tested sero-positive. The intervention yielded lowered HIV stigma, increase in HIV knowledge, and agreement to take the HIV home test. These results are encouraging because they suggest that a brief educational intervention is a critical pathway to the success of the National Institutes on Drug Abuse’s Seek, Test, Treat, and Retain initiative in poor rural counties.

Voluntary study participation in a clinical trial of HPV vaccine with Peruvian FSWs

**Abstract**

This study examined female sex workers’ evaluation of ethically relevant experiences of participating in an HPV4 vaccine clinical trial conducted in Lima, Peru (the Sunflower Study). The Sunflower Study provided all participants with HPV testing, treatment for those testing positive, and access to the vaccine for all testing negative. Themes that emerged from content analysis of interviews with 16 former participants included the importance of respectful treatment and access to healthcare not otherwise available and concerns about privacy protections, the potential for HIV stigma, and poststudy abandonment.

**Background**

Dr. [Brenda Curtis](https://irp.drugabuse.gov/organization/cptrb/ttru/) is currently a an Section Chief at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). She received her Masters of Science in Public Health from the University of Illinois and her Doctoral degree from the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. Her principal research interests have been in the fields of Health Communication and Public Health. She is very interested in providing scientifically tailored health information that is evidence based. She attempts to translate research into programs that allow for the building of individual and community capacity. In her recent research, she developed a web-based smoking cessation intervention program and conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the relative effectiveness of tailoring the intervention content to particular demographic (age, gender, ethnicity), and also functional behavioral attributes of the individuals in the target population. That is, the computer used particular presentations of the same message that were individually designed to attributes known to be important in gaining attention and shaping behavior. She found that this relatively simple and inexpensive procedure was able to improve intention to quit by over 19%. Dr. Curtis is continuing to explore this line of research and recently deployed a substance use screening and brief intervention web-based interactive program she developed into a New York school district. Dr. Curtis is also working on innovative ways to increase enrollment and retention of hard to reach populations into HIV clinical trials. Her research has led her to examine the ethical implications raised by the use of the Internet and social media to recruit and retain subjects into HIV related studies. She is particularly interested in assessing how Institutional Review Boards are implementing new policies and procedures to deal with online recruitment.

Online Recruiting for HIV Research: Ethical Issues and Concerns for Investigators and IRBs

**Abstract**

Online research has become a critical recruitment modality for understanding and reducing health disparities among hidden populations most at risk for HIV infection. There is a lack of consensus and guidelines for the responsible conduct of online recruitment for HIV risk populations. Using semi-structured phone interviews, this study drew on the experiences of principal investigators (PIs) engaged in online HIV research to illuminate scientific and ethical benefits and challenges of social media recruitment. Using Thematic Analysis five major themes emerged: sampling advantages and disadvantages; challenges of data integrity; control of privacy protections; researcher competence and responsibility; and resources.

Barriers and Facilitators to Participation in HIV Research: Female Sex Workers’ Perspectives

**Abstract**

This study explored perceived benefits and risks of participation in HIV research among 33 female sex workers in Tecún Umán, Guatemala. Stigma associated with sex work and HIV was a critical barrier to research participation. Key benefits of participation included access to HIV/STI prevention and testing, as well as positive and trusting relationships between sex workers and research teams. Control exerted by managers had mixed influences on perceived research risks and benefits. Results underscore the critical need for HIV investigators to develop population-tailored procedures to reduce stigma; engage managers; and reinforce trusting, reciprocal relationships between sex work communities and researchers.

Barriers and facilitators to YMSM participating in HIV-related research studies in Thailand: Perspectives of parents and teens

**Abstract**

Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) under 18 years are often excluded from HIV prevention research in Thailand due to cultural attitudes toward youth sexuality, social stigma, and difficulties obtaining guardian permission. Culturally sensitive focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were conducted with parents and YMSM in Bangkok, Thailand and identified barriers and facilitators related to minors’ participation in HIV prevention research. Although gender and class differences emerged, mothers and fathers were generally accepting of research to reduce HIV risk,but not in favor of waiver. Youth’s positive attitude toward parental permission wastempered by concerns about harms posed by disclosing same-sex attraction through permission forms.

Knowledge of rights to sexual reproductive health services among 12-18 year olds in Hammanskraal

**Abstract**

This article describes challenges of conducting an HIV prevention program involving 40 male and female participants ages 12–18 in Hammanskraal, South Africa, aimed at increasing awareness and knowledge of laws protecting children’s sexual health rights and access to services through a culturally based “study circle” format. Challenges highlighted by the project included Institutional Review Board approval of youth consent procedures, cooperation and coordination with local policymakers, the need to modify presentation materials to youths’ comprehension levels, availability of youth-based sexual health service providers, and cultural ambiguity over parental involvement in youth health care decisions and laws pertaining to sexual relationships among minors.

Exploring IRB Responses to Participant Complaints: Processes, Values, and Resources

**Abstract**

Under US federal regulations, participants providing informed consent must receive information regarding whom to contact in case of a research-related injury or complaint. Although informed consent processes routinely direct participants to contact institutional review boards (IRBs) with questions or concerns, there has been little empirical study of the ways in which IRBs act to resolve participants' research-related complaints. This article explores available literature on participant complaints, considers the responsibilities of IRBs in dispute resolution, and outlines a research agenda. As a case study, this review considers disputes arising from HIV/AIDS research, focusing on novel issues arising from biomedical HIV prevention trials.

Participant perspectives of risks and benefits of participating in a text message-delivered intervention for safer sex communication

**Abstract**

Interventions to decrease acquisition and transmission of sexually transmitted diseases among African American women using text messages versus small group delivery modalities pose distinct research risks and benefits. Determining the relative risk-benefit ratio of studies using these different modalities has relied on the expertise of investigators and their institutional review boards. In this study, African American women participated in focus groups and surveys to elicit and compare risks and benefits inherent in these two intervention delivery modalities, focusing on issues such as convenience, privacy, and stigma of participation. Some risk/benefit variables were implicated in willingness to participate the two intervention modalities.

Participants were primarily drawn from a group of young people who inject drugs (PWID) and who are or have recently been participants in an epidemiological study of HIV and HCV transmission conducted by the University of California, San Francisco. Data collection among this group involved qualitative focus groups (2 groups involving 14 people total) and one-on-one interviews (22 people) conducted using procedures drawn from grounded theory and situational analysis. Three additional one-on-one interviews were conducted with researchers to clarify and explore points raised by research participants. Preliminary data was presented at the national Harm Reduction Conference in November 2012, a conference attended by needle exchange workers and other individuals who work directly with PWID; feedback from conference attendees is also being incorporated into data analysis. Data collection ended in February 2013, and final analysis is currently underway. The research is expected to offer insight into disjuncts between the ways Federal Code and young PWID understand research participation which have the potential to inadvertently leave research participants feeling mistreated.

Physician attitudes and behavior towards HIV+ IDUs

**Abstract**

While adherence to HAART may be affected among IDUs, due to the instable lifestyle associated with drug seeking and use (Wood et al., 2008), the risk of development of antiretroviral resistance among IDUs has not been found to be higher than their non-IDU counterparts (Werb et al., 2010). Despite this, IDU status has been found effect access to care for HIV (WHO, 2006; Wood et al., 2008), with evidence that physician reluctance to prescribe HIV may play contribute to this disparity (Bassetti, 1999; Ding et al., 2005). To determine the impact of IDU status on physician prescribing behavior, a national sample of community-based HIV prescribing providers completed an online survey in which they were presented with two case vignettes describing a patient with previous adherence issues presenting for treatment and requesting reinstatement on antiretroviral medications. The vignettes were identical with the exception of the IDU status of the patient. Participants were randomly assigned to see either the IDU or non-IDU (NIDU) vignette first. To date 156 participants have consented to participate in the study and 112 of these submitted complete responses. Participants were predominately female (55.8%), White (77.9%), and practicing in Urban settings (80.5%). Participants were well distributed by state. Most participants were physicians (47.8%) or nurse practitioners (45.1%), with a smaller samples of physician assistants (7.1%). Independent samples t-tests revealed that neither IDU prescribing behavior (t(118)=-.258, p=.797) nor NIDU prescribing behavior (t(117)=-.693) differed significantly by condition (order of presentation). Consequently, conditions were collapsed for future analyses. A paired samples t-test was conducted to evaluate the impact of patient IDU status on prescribing behavior. There was a statistically significant difference between reported likelihood of prescribing for NIDU (M=3.51, SD=1.37) versus IDU patients (M=3.03, SD=1.37), t(115) = -5.03, p < .001. Attitudes towards shared decision making and concerns about adherence are both predictive of less willingness to prescribe to IDUs.

Exploring participant experiences in a peer-delivered HIV intervention with IV drug users

**Abstract**

We explore ethical issues faced by investigators as they conduct research as part of a peer-delivered HIV/AIDS risk reduction program for injection drug users (IDUs). Staff and participant experiences in peer-delivered interventions among IDUs have come under scrutiny by ethics researchers because of their potential to inadvertently and negatively impact participant rehabilitation due to continued engagement with drug-using networks during the course of outreach. This study explores whether enhanced communication of participant concerns and experiences with clinic and research staff helps to reduce inadvertent malfeasance in peer-delivered drug treatment interventions. Results contribute to the development of patient support infrastructure in peer-delivered risk reduction programs involving IDUs.

Ethical issues in the deliver of prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV interventions in South India

**Abstract**

In India, approximately 49,000 women living with HIV become pregnant and deliver each year. While the government of India has made progress increasing the availability of prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) services, only about one quarter of pregnant women received an HIV test in 2010, and about one-in-five that were found positive for HIV received interventions to prevent vertical transmission of HIV. Between February 2012 to March 2013, 14 HIV-positive women who had recently delivered a baby were recruited from HIV positive women support groups, Government of India Integrated Counseling and Testing Centers, and nongovernmental organizations in Mysore and Pune, India. In-depth interviews were conducted to examine their general experiences with antenatal healthcare; specific experiences around HIV counseling and testing; and perceptions about their care and follow-up treatment. Data were analyzed thematically using the human rights framework for HIV testing adopted by the United Nations and India’s National AIDS Control Organization. While all of the HIV-positive women in the study received HIV and PMTCT services at a government hospital or antiretroviral therapy center, almost all reported attending a private clinic or hospital at some point in their pregnancy. According to the participants, HIV testing often occurred without consent; there was little privacy; breaches of confidentiality were commonplace; and denial of medical treatment occurred routinely. Among women living with HIV in this study, violations of their human rights occurred more commonly in private rather than public healthcare settings. There is an urgent need for capacity building among private healthcare providers to improve standards of practice with regard to informed consent process, HIV testing, patient confidentiality, treatment, and referral of pregnant women living with HIV.

Human subject research training for community researchers: A Pacific Northwest Native American cultural prospective

**Abstract**

Current Human Subject Research training modules fail to capture ethically relevant cultural aspects of research involving American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) community members. Applying a Community Engaged Research (CEnR) approach, we adapted the Collaborative IRB Training Initiative training module “assessing risk and benefits.” In a two-arm randomized controlled trial, followed by debriefing interviews, we evaluated module acceptability and understandability (test scores) among 40 reservation-based community members. Participants who took the adapted module, compared to those who took the standard module, reported higher scores on relevance of the material overall satisfaction, module quiz scores, and a trend toward higher self-efficacy. Implications of the efficacy of this approach for enhancing ethics training and community participation in research within AI/AN and other cultural populations within and outside the United States are discussed.

Perceptions of HIV prevention research participation among women working as sex workers in Andhra Pradesh, India

**Abstract**

Female sex workers (FSWs) from Andhra Pradesh, India, who had participated in HIV research were interviewed to examine participant perspectives on research ethics. Content analysis indicated that aspects of the consent process, staff gender and demeanor, study environment, survey content, time requirements for study participation, and perceived FSW community support for research were key factors influencing whether FSWs perceived their confidentiality and privacy had been maintained, and whether they felt the study was conducted respectfully. Findings suggest that partnership with community-based organizations and investigation of participant's experiences in HIV prevention research can provide critical information to best inform research ethics protocols, a particular priority among research studies with highly stigmatized populations, such as FSWs.

Social and structural constraints on disclosure and informed consent with female sex workers and their managers in the Philippines

**Abstract**

This qualitative study explored the ethical issues of female sex workers' (FSWs) participation in HIV prevention research. Twenty female bar/spa workers and 10 venue managers in the Philippines underwent individual semi-structured interviews; three community advisory board meetings informed the study design and interpretation of findings. Results: Informed consent was constrained by perceived government coercion and skepticism that research results would translate into community benefits. Disclosure was constrained by distrust in confidentiality and perceived intrusiveness of survey questions. FSWs and managers were frustrated by the government's inability to stop police from using condoms as evidence of prostitution. Findings suggest HIV interventions move beyond didactic prevention workshops to include FSWs in intervention design and implementation, and to reduce social and structural constraints on participation.
