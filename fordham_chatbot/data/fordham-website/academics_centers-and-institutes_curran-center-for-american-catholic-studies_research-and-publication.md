# Research and Publication

Our center is committed to advancing understanding and fostering dialogue on the rich and diverse narratives of American Catholicism.

We invite scholars, students, and the intellectually curious to explore our research projects, each creating unique insights into American Catholic history, culture, and thought. Our research endeavors extend beyond the gates of Fordham University, as we actively collaborate with a network of esteemed institutions and scholars across the nation and beyond. This collaborative spirit not only enriches our work but also amplifies the impact and reach of our studies.

We invite you to delve into our research, be inspired by our discoveries, and join us in our continuous pursuit of knowledge and understanding in American Catholic Studies.

## Taking Responsibility

Fordham University has received a major private foundation grant to advance research regarding the protection of children, youth, and vulnerable persons in Jesuit institutions of education. This interdisciplinary initiative is a partnership of the [Francis and Ann Curran Center for American Catholic Studies](/academics/centers-and-institutes/curran-center-for-american-catholic-studies/) and the [Department of Theology](/academics/departments/theology/).

Our activities will include the following:

- funding research by Fordham faculty and faculty at other Jesuit institutions;
- hosting panels, webinars, reading groups, and other events dedicated to understanding the experience of structurally vulnerable groups (including but not limited to children; African American, Latinx, and Indigenous populations; working-class populations; and college students);
- developing literature reviews and other resources intended for administrators, staff, faculty, alumni, and students at Jesuit educational institutions; and
- creating a partner network of Jesuit educational institutions dedicated to our goal of “confronting the causes and legacy of clergy sexual abuse.”

This website will be updated as our program develops. If you wish to be alerted about major developments, please contact us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f98d989290979e8b9c8a8996978a909b9095908d80b99f968b9d919894d79c9d8c).

If you are a survivor of clerical sexual abuse at Fordham, we strongly encourage you to report your experience to Fordham's Special Committee on Clerical Sexual Abuse and with [the victim advocate for the Jesuits USA East Province](https://www.jesuitseast.org/about-us/protecting-children/).
