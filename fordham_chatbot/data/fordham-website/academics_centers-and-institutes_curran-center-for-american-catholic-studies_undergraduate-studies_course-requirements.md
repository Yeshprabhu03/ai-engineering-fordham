# Course Requirements

## Course Requirements

Students wishing to complete the concentration must complete the following coursework within the appropriate timeframe:

|
Sophomore Year/ Spring Semester |
Junior Year/ Fall Semester | Junior Year/ Spring Semester |
|---|---|---|
| AMCS 3100 Discernment Seminar | AMCS 3981 Catholic Studies Seminar I* | AMCS 3982 Catholic Studies Seminar II* |

*The Seminars should, ideally, be taken in succession in Junior year. We can make exceptions to this rule for students who wish to Study Abroad. Students who study abroad may take either seminar in the Senior year; Seminar II may be taken before Seminar I, if necessary.

## Basket Courses

Basket Courses are a unique and integral part of the curriculum, offering students the opportunity to explore a diverse range of subjects that enrich their academic experience. These courses are designed to broaden students' intellectual horizons by encouraging exploration in the arts, humanities, social sciences, and theology.

Between the spring semester of sophomore year and the spring semester of senior year, students are required to complete four Basket Courses, one from each of the following areas:

- 1 course in art history, music, or English
- 1 course in history or Latin American and Latino studies
- 1 course in philosophy or social science
- 1 course in theology

Basket courses can be selected from the following:*

- Courses listed on the Course Registration Page (e.g. MLAL 3015)
- Courses offered by the Curran Center bearing “AMCS” designation (e.g. AMCS 3350)
- Courses on Banner accorded the American Catholic Studies attribute (e.g. THEO 3993)

In the event a student wishes to take a course that has significant Catholic content but does not fall into any of these 3 categories, the student must submit the [Basket Course Application](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/pdfs/jadu-pdfs/11574/CACS_Basket_Course_Application.pdf) to have the course approved.

## Concentrator Record Form

At the end of each year, students must download and complete the [Concentrator Record Form](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/pdfs/jadu-single-folder-pdfs/Concentrator_Record_Form_.pdf), which can be submitted by email or in person. This form helps us ensure the timely disbursal of scholarship monies and track our Concentrators' progress in the program.

## Additional Requirements

In addition to course requirements, the concentration also includes a service component. Students are required to complete 3-5 hours of off-campus community engagement per week during at least two semesters between the spring semester of sophomore year and the spring semester of senior year.
