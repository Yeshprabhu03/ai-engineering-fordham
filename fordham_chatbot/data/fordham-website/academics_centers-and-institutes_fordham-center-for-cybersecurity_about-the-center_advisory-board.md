# FCC Advisory Board

**The Fordham Center for Cybersecurity Advisory Board -** Our Advisory board is comprised of industry professionals who are external to Fordham’s ecosystem. They ensure that any propagated curriculum is up to date with industry standards, practices, and new emerging threats. Their recommendations are collected and integrated into the Cybersecurity Center’s suggestions for alterations of learning topics and then reviewed by Executive Committee for Knowledge Unit (KU) alignment and instantiation into the program.
