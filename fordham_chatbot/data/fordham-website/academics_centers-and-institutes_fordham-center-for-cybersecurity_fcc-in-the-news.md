#### Published CVE

July 19, 2018 - Peter Ivezaj, President of Digital Upkeep and recent graduate of the Fordham Cybersecurity program, has published a CVE pertaining to an authentication flaw in VMWare Horizon DaaS (Desktop as a Service). [CVE 2018-6960](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-6960) is an authentication flaw that may allow an attacker to bypass two factor authentication with a legitimate account on Horizon DaaS. VMWare's information security group was contacted and promptly issued a patch for the vulnerability. Ivezaj emphasizes the need to know your own devices and services thoroughly, proactively adapting your system design for security. He has been inspired by "a spirit of excellence in the atmosphere at Fordham, with collaboration amongst information security peers, intelligence community professionals, academic researchers, and full time students." Dr. Thaier Hayajneh, Director of the Fordham Center for Cybersecurity, states "We are very proud of this accomplishment by one of our students. Identifying new vulnerabilities is a difficult but critical contribution for advancing the field of cybersecurity."
