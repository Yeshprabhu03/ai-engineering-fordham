GenCyber is a national initiative supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Security Agency (NSA). This program has the following objectives:

- Encourage interest and diversity in cybersecurity postsecondary education and workforce opportunities
- Improve teaching methods for delivering cybersecurity education
- Strengthen security knowledge and practices among the next generation of cybersecurity professionals
- Offer a tailored, immersive learning experience for young students interested in the cybersecurity field

As the risk of cyberattacks and device vulnerability continues to increase, while the skills gap in the cybersecurity industry remains, it is important now more than ever to promote cybersecurity knowledge, interest, and talent in this field amongst our student generations.

New Technologies are rapidly growing in popularity and can revolutionize how individuals conduct business. For example, blockchain can reduce the risk of data breaches and provide transaction security and transparency. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency is becoming increasingly mainstream, with more businesses and individuals accepting it as payment. Furthermore, learning about blockchain and cryptocurrency can also inspire students to pursue careers in the tech industry, where these technologies are being developed and implemented. Our GenCyber 2023 camp will provide an immersive learning experience using blockchain as a backbone to teach cybersecurity principles.

-
At no cost to participants, the Fordham GenCyber camp will be a five-day in-person camp in the summer of 2023. Fordham’s 2023 GenCyber camp will be held from July 10th-July 14th. Instruction will be delivered by a team of professors, instructors, and guest speakers of varied backgrounds who have established expertise in cybersecurity teaching and research. The camp will provide engaging instruction, collaborative group activities, hands-on laboratory experiences, and informal instruction to both individuals and groups of participants. Upon completion of the camp, participants will have a strong understanding of cybersecurity essentials, in addition to mastering basic skills that will enable them to be aware of cyber ethics and hygiene, cryptography, cryptocurrency, and Python programming. With direct mentoring and access to cybersecurity graduate students and professionals, students will additionally learn about cybersecurity pathways in both industry and formal education and how to pursue a future in this field.

-
Under the leadership of Dr. Thaier Hayajneh, Director of Fordham Center of Cybersecurity (FCC), Fordham has been awarded funding to run the GenCyber program in the summer of 2023. The camp is open to high school students. It will address essential security concepts with a concentration on blockchain and cryptocurrency through informative lessons and hands-on, collaborative activities to strengthen interest in cybersecurity among middle and high school students in New York and beyond.
