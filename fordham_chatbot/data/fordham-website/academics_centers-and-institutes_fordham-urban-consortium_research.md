**Should New York City reconsider term limits?**

from **city and state new york**[“Ask the Experts”](https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/ask-experts/should-new-york-city-reconsider-term-limits.html): *Does allowing former members to run again after a hiatus contradict the purpose of term limits?*

The primary goals of New York City’s term limits law were to bring fresh faces and ideas to the City Council and to decrease the role of professional politicians in local policy making. Allowing former council members to run again, even after a break, does appear to contradict the goals of term limits. Looking at recent City Council elections, however, many of the newly elected council members replacing the term limited council members have been former council staff, family members, or individuals who have already served in elective office at the state level. They are just as much professional politicians as those whom they replaced. So the goals of term limits have not been well served by its current iteration. Professional politicians are still being elected to the council, even if they are not incumbent council members. As a result, allowing former council members to run again, after a break, would not change, or harm, the workings of the council in any significant way.[Bruce Berg], professor of political science at Fordham University:

from [critically speaking](https://criticallyspeaking.libsyn.com/029-dr-garrett-broad-lab-grown-meat-present-and-future-considerations):

Garrett Broad is an Assistant Professor of Communication and Media Studies at Fordham University and the author of [ More Than Just Food: Food Justice and Community Change](https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520287457/more-than-just-food). His research investigates the role of storytelling and communication technology in promoting networked movements for social justice. Much of his work focuses on local and global food systems, as he explores how food can best contribute to improved neighborhood health, environmental sustainability, and the rights and welfare of animals.

In this episode, [Therese Markow](http://biology.ucsd.edu/research/faculty/tmarkow) and Dr. Garrett Broad discuss the emerging culture around cellular meat and the changing space for this product in the marketplace. Therese and Dr. Broad discuss how the animal cells are acquired, the process of growing the “meat" in a lab, and the types of products currently, and possibly in the future, grown in laboratories. They also discuss how food activists can make beneficial impacts on food justice and food sovereignty and change "food deserts" or "food swamps” and the communities in which they are embedded.

**What Is Meat? Garrett Broad talks alternative proteins**

Garrett Broad, Fordham Assistant Professor of **Communication and Media Studies** and author of [More Than Just Food](http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520287457), examines the problems of the industrial production of animals for food—climate change, wastes resources, public health, and animal suffering—and a possible solution: lab-grown cellular agriculture, or clean meat.

“Ethical arguments to turn the world vegan haven’t worked. Instead, alternative protein advocates look to food technology to transform how the world eats.”

**Law And The New Urban Agenda**

**from** Nestor M. Davidson & [Geeta Tewari](https://delawarelaw.widener.edu/current-students/faculty-directory/faculty/235/) —

Dear Colleagues,

The [Urban Law Center's](https://www.urbanlawcenter.org/) newest volume, * Law and the New Urban Agenda*, will be available on May 15, 2020 as an e-book and you can

[pre-order](https://www.routledge.com/Law-and-the-New-Urban-Agenda-1st-Edition/Davidson-Tewari/p/book/9780367188733)the hard copy now.

Given COVID-19’s impact on cities globally, it is more important than ever to highlight the significance of urban law and policy for students. This new book offers a constructive and critical valuation of the legal dimensions of the U.N.’s ** New Urban Agenda** (NUA), adopted at the 2016

[United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/habitat3/)to foster a globally shared understanding of the vital link between urbanization and a sustainable future. A myriad of legal challenges – and opportunities – stand between the NUA and its goals. Examining case studies from natural disasters and resulting urban migration in Honshu and Tacloban, to innovative collaborative governance in Barcelona and Turin, to the accessibility of public space for informal workers in New Delhi and Accra, and power scales among Brazil’s metropolitan regions, the contributions in this new book frame an important academic dialogue about the legal dimensions of the NUA, all of which will be of interest to scholars across the range of urban studies.

Law and the New Urban Agenda underscores the value of urban law as a discipline in supporting the healthy development of inclusive cities for all. This timely volume sheds light on the many complex challenges that urban growth poses for legal systems around the globe, and I commend this eclectic group of scholars for their engagement with the New Urban Agenda. –[Maimunah Mohd Sharif], Executive Director, UN-Habitat

**Culture shifts in gun control preemption laws**

A [recent Florida ruling](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article233188131.html) could mark a change in the political landscape around **city gun control**, said Nestor M. Davidson, Fordham Professor of Law. More than 40 states have passed “**preemption laws**” to keep from becoming a “patchwork of competing gun laws,” wrote Tricia L. Nadolny in [USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/08/16/philadelphia-mayor-jim-kenney-gun-control-preemption-laws/2031870001/). But mayors in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Dayton, and Tucson are frustrated by their inability to enact solutions to local violence.

“If the larger political culture shifts,” said Davidson, “I won’t be surprised to see if – as in Florida – the pushback does materialize in a way where, whether it’s through litigation or legislation, you are going to see the balance shift.”

**The Confederate Statues’ Ruling**

[Richard Schragger](https://www.law.virginia.edu/faculty/profile/rcs4t/1206421), on

[to discuss the ruling and controversy over the](https://legaltalknetwork.com/podcasts/lawyer-2-lawyer/)

**Lawyer 2 Lawyer****removal of Confederate statues**and what is next in this legal fight.

“There are important statutory issues. I think the equal protection question is an important one, and whether this ends at the Virginia Supreme Court or ultimately goes up to the U.S. Supreme Court will largely turn on whether this case is decided as a matter of Virginia law both under the statute and questions of legislative immunity which we typically decided as a question of state law. I think if the case is resolved in a way that rests on those Virginia grounds, we’ll see it end at the Virginia Supreme Court, if it goes that far, and I tend to suspect that it will given how Judge Moore has ruled. I don’t think the city is going to let that ruling stand, or at least they are going to I assume pursue an appeal but the federal constitutional question such as the equal protection defense, which really goes in many ways to the heart of the conflict about what these statues mean and who gets to speak for the community, raises important federal constitutional questions.”

**The Dilemma of Localism in an Era of Polarization**

**abstract.** Localism, the discourse of local legal power and state-local relations, has returned to the center of national attention, driven by gridlock at the federal level and sharply rising political and cultural conflicts between cities and their states. In recent years, states have aggressively sought to constrain, eliminate, and even criminalize local policy discretion across an array of policy domains. Cities and their advocates have just as aggressively fought back—in litigation, in the political arena, and in popular discourse.

**Mapping Conference Tackles Justice Issues from a Geographic Perspective**

**from fordham news:**

In a three-day symposium titled “[Mapping (In)Justice](https://mappinginjustice.org/),” dozens of scholars came to Fordham’s Lincoln Center campus from Nov. 7 to Nov. 9 to examine how **digital mapping** is being used by academics as a methodology to study justice and injustice, particularly when researching underserved communities.

[Gregory Donovan](/academics/departments/communication-and-media-studies/about-us/faculty-and-staff/gregory-t-donovan/), Ph.D., assistant professor in the Department of Communication and Media Studies and co-founder of the Fordham Digital Scholarship Consortium, organized the conference with department chair Jacqueline Reich, Ph.D.

“Spatial media have politics, these are not neutral things,” said Donovan, who teaches a course of the same name as the conference for the Masters in Public Media. “We need to look at how our subjects are using digital mapping in their own lives and not just use this technology to study them from afar, like a scientist with a clipboard.”

**Why a Ghent-like system is needed in the US**

**from the center for american progress.org:**

TheGhent system—an arrangement whereby trade unions help deliver government-supported unemployment insurance—exists in its truest form only in a handful of countries, including Sweden, Belgium, and Denmark. However, the United States has a number of Ghent-like policies where unions deliver or help people access governmental benefits—including workforce training, retirement benefits, and enforcement of workplace laws. Expanding upon these models would increase union membership and improve the quality of public programs in the United States.

In "[Strengthening Labor Standards Enforcement Through Partnerships with Workers' Organizations](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228160826_Strengthening_Labor_Standards_Enforcement_Through_Partnerships_with_Workers'_Organizations)" (*Politics & Society*, 2010), Fordham Professor of Law [Jennifer Gordon](/school-of-law/faculty/directory/full-time/jennifer-gordon/) and [Janice Fine](https://smlr.rutgers.edu/faculty-staff/janice-r-fine) of Rutgers University argue that there is a mismatch between the enforcement strategies of most federal and state labor inspectorates and the industries in which noncompliance continues to be a problem. The authors propose augmenting labor inspectorates by giving public interest groups like unions and worker centers a formal, ongoing role in enforcement in low-wage sectors.

Under a Ghent-like co-enforcement model, government could complement its traditional enforcement activity by partnering with unions and worker organizations, Fine and Gordon have explained.

from * the city*:

“A long roster of progressive political newcomers is targeting Queens incumbents in local and national races — setting off primaries next year for some elected officials who’ve run unopposed for years.”

“Given gentrification and “shifting patterns of migration,” it’s natural that a crop of challengers are springing up in Queens, said , a Fordham University political science professor.

Gentrifiers are in a “higher economic class, tend to vote more and tend to demand things that community members have gotten used to not having,” she said.”

**Gentrification in New York**

If you go out the door and are surrounded by **smoothies** and **coffee roasters** and the **Craft Beer **is served in jars for a great deal of money, you know this area has been thoroughly gentrified. This can be seen in Berlin as well as in New York at a glance.

New York is becoming more and more expensive, many can hardly afford the rent in the city and are repressed - and the protest against gentrification and repression has little chance. **But how do the New Yorkers actually perceive it**, when once rundown neighborhoods are upgraded and everything is getting more and more expensive?

Listen to the podcast with Associate Professor of Political Science [Annika M. Hinze](/academics/departments/urban-studies/faculty/annika-hinze/) on [Radiobrücke USA](https://rbbmediapmdp-a.akamaihd.net/content/988c84f8-1750-42e8-a0ac-b4ec882fdbd6_46a395f3-f144-4479-83c8-9d0d7c881417.mp3).

**What Makes a Great City Tick?**

Director of Urban Studies, and Professor of Political Science, [Annika Hinze](/academics/departments/urban-studies/faculty/annika-hinze/), is researching the best practices for making cities just, fair, and equitable for all.

*If you go into communities and interview people who live in what we call gentrifying communities, a lot of them welcome the changes in the neighborhood. Everybody wants to live in a nice neighborhood, with good infrastructure, and good schools that come with gentrification. It’s just that the residents want to stay in the neighborhood once it turns.*

Because cities are growing in importance around the globe, Hinze said she’s eager to continue [partnerships with institutions](/academics/departments/urban-studies/master-of-arts-in-urban-studies/about-urban-studies/international-partners/) in **Pretoria**, **Berlin**, and **Amsterdam**, and recruit more international students to study in New York. Closer to home, courses like [The Urban Lab](/academics/centers-and-institutes/fordham-urban-consortium/about-us/), which is being co-taught this semester by former urban studies director Rosemary Wakeman, Ph.D., professor of history, and Fordham Law’s **Sheila Foster**, exemplify the way the urban studies degree is truly interdisciplinary.

**Empirical Evidence in the Administration of Family Law**

"Each year, reports of alleged abuse and neglect of nearly 7.5 million children reach local child welfare agencies across the United States. With so many reports, agencies need to determine which require an urgent response. Many child welfare agencies are turning to empirical evidence to help triage these cases.

"In [a recent paper](https://columbialawreview.org/content/the-empirical-turn-in-family-law/), Clare Huntington, a law professor at Fordham University, acknowledges that empirical evidence—especially the use of predictive analytics—can improve child welfare policies and practices. But she argues that empirical data must be used with great caution."

To guide this nuance,[this Essay’s]framework calls for more effective gatekeeping mechanisms across the institutions of family law. It warns decisionmakers to be attentive to the potential for empirical evidence to reflect and refract the legal salience of intersecting identities, including race, gender, and class. And the framework encourages a robust role for legal scholars to make empirical evidence accessible and comprehensible for those crafting legal rules and policies.

**Anti-discrimination and health law**

**from the american medical association:**

Incidents of identity-based **patient bias** are disturbing for all health professionals, but they can present especially intense challenges for physicians in training due to the number of patient interactions they experience. **Kimani Paul-Emile**, PhD, professor at Fordham University School of Law, recommends an approach to helping colleagues during a real-time discrimination incident and addressing discrimination organization-wide.

“Despite the startling statistics regarding patients’ treatment of trainees, data and overwhelming anecdotal evidence show that organizations are not adequately supporting their trainees in dealing with these abusive patient encounters. Indeed, 50% of surveyed residents who experienced or witnessed patient discrimination didn’t know how to respond, while 25% believed that nothing would be done if hospital leadership were notified.”

**Civil Liberties in Cyberspac**

**from fordham law news:**

On October 23, 2019, Fordham Law School hosted a packed room of students to hear University of California, Berkeley Law Professor ** Pam Samuelson**, the Distinguished Bacon-Kilkenny Visiting Professor of Law at Fordham, talk about “Challenges to Civil Liberties in Cyberspace.” Professor

[Olivier Sylvain](/school-of-law/faculty/directory/full-time/olivier-sylvain/)moderated the discussion in which Professor Samuelson explored a wide range of information law issues, including the evolution of

**digital copyright law**, privacy issues, and the

**First Amendment**.

Both professors also spoke about **privacy** and data **protection**. The subject is particularly timely given recent congressional hearings involving Facebook and other social media companies.

Professors Samuelson and Sylvain noted the major differences between the U.S. and the European Union’s approach to privacy protections.

“The U.S. also has a relatively recent and long tradition of systematic privacy invasion,” said Sylvain. Unlike Europe, however, “laws here were in the service of racial subordination through slavery, Jim Crow, and segregation. Civil rights groups like the NAACP and the ACLU brought free speech and freedom of association cases on behalf of activists who had been surveilled by the Department of Justice, as well as state and local police,” Sylvain said.

**Fordham law professor argues for corporate social media responsibility**

Fordham Professor of Law, and Director of the ** McGannon Center for Communications Research**, argues that the broad protections of

**Section 230**of the

**Communications Decency Act**should be curtailed. Speaking to

**in light of tensions between President Trump and Silicon Valley, Sylvain states that the current law shields social media companies from consequences when their technology is weaponized against their users:**

[The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/456906-trump-seeks-powers-to-rein-in-alleged-tech-bias)“My argument is that the very people that civil rights statutes are written for, the very people for whom consumer protection statutes are written for, are exposed to greater threat and harm under the current broad immunity under Section 230.

“The way in which courts have read the statute, Section 230 now effectively enables the further degradation of communities that are supposed to be protected under law," he added. "The principle problem is that, free from having to attend to constitutional regulations of speech, too many companies have not heeded their social responsibility. That’s the real problem.”

**Helping Harlem Stay Connected**

How will a new technological endeavor that brings affordable Web devices into residents’ homes through a community-based broadband network benefit residents of Harlem? Olivier Sylvain, [associate professor of law at Fordham](/school-of-law/faculty/directory/full-time/olivier-sylvain/), and a team of lawyers, engineers, and entrepreneurs intend to find out.

The National Science Foundation has awarded Sylvain and his colleagues [a $1 million grant over three years.](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1737453&HistoricalAwards=false) The award is part of the NSF’s program for Smart and Connected Communities. The project aims to remedy the relatively low rates of broadband adoption and the deficit of advanced networked devices among Harlem residents.

**Built Heritage special issue on Shanghai**

A new special issue of [Built Heritage](https://www.built-heritage.net/issue-11-content), “Shanghai: Heritage at the Crossroads of Culture,” is edited by

**Fordham Professor of History**Rosemary Wakeman. The journal is published by the

[College of Architecture and Urban Planning](https://caup.tongji.edu.cn/caupen/main.htm)at Tongji University in Shanghai.

**from wakeman's introduction: **

Shanghai is among the most dynamic global cities of both the 20th and 21st centuries. The city is China’s gateway to the world and its aspirations for the future. With more than 24 million people, 40 percent of whom are migrants, it is a global crossroads and one of the most multicultural cities in the world. It has more skyscrapers than New York and a public transport system that overtakes most global cities. Shanghai is a trading city, an entrepot of commodities. It exports electronic information products, automobiles, petrochemicals, fine steel, equipment, and biomedicine. It has the highest GDP of any city in China’s mainland and has become one of the leading financial sectors in East Asia, with major Western banks flocking to its new financial centre. With well over 500 multinational companies, the city attracts more foreign investment flows than most developing countries. Along with them has come a highly-skilled workforce from all over the world. Shanghai’s urban middle-class has fuelled China’s consumer revolution and a property boom. Sleek skyscrapers and glamorous malls, its brilliant skyline, dominate the global image of Shanghai and beckon tourists to its shores.

In ** Practicing Utopia**, Professor of History Rosemary Wakeman gives a sweeping view of the new town movement as a global phenomenon. From Tapiola in Finland to Islamabad in Pakistan, Cergy-Pontoise in France to Irvine in California, Wakeman unspools a masterly account of the golden age of new towns, exploring their utopian qualities and investigating what these towns can tell us about contemporary modernization and urban planning.

**The “Urban Question” is Now at the Center of Intellectual Life**

In a new interview with [ Global Urban History.com](https://globalurbanhistory.com/2017/01/23/the-urban-question-is-now-at-the-center-of-intellectual-life-a-conversation-with-rosemary-wakeman/#more-2779), Rosemary Wakeman, Coordinator of

[Urban Initiatives](/academics/departments/urban-studies/international-initiatives/)and Professor of History at Fordham, discusses the intersection between

**global history**and

**urban history**.

The city is the locus for a wide range of philosophies and ideas, policy innovation, models, architectural and design concepts, and heritage narratives. All of it indicates the degree to which the vast, complex urban fabric in which we live has become THE arena of the imagination. This is all fantastic, but where does this abundance of interest leave urban history as an intellectual endeavor?
