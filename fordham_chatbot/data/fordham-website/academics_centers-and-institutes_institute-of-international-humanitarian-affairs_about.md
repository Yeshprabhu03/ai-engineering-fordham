# About IIHA

Founded in 2001 in partnership with the [Center for International Humanitarian Cooperation (CIHC)](http://www.cihc.org/), the Institute of International Humanitarian Affairs (IIHA) is a university-wide center that reports directly to the President of Fordham University. By incorporating the academic rigor and intellectual standard of Fordham University with the experience and expertise of aid and development agencies in the field, we endeavor to advance the methods and framework by which humanitarian workers operate. As such, we serve as a unique bridge between academia and humanitarian efforts worldwide.
