FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

BRONX, NY - FORDHAM UNIVERSITY’S INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS FINALIZES MoU WITH IOM - UN MIGRATION AGENCY AND NAIF ARAB UNIVERSITY FOR SECURITY SCIENCES (NAUSS), SAUDI ARABIA

Last week, representatives from Fordham University, IOM, and NAUSS signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), encouraging faculty, staff, and students from all parties to look closely at international migration and migration issues. The MoU will allow interested participants to engage in research, conferences, training, and student opportunities. Representatives who signed the MoU include Ellen Fahey-Smith, Fordham University Vice Provost; Dr. Khaled Alassiri, NAUSS Vice President for External Relations; and Ashraf El Nour, IOM Head of Office in Saudi Arabia.

“The agreement is something that we are all happy about and is not the end but is the start of building and furthering knowledge on migration.” - Ashraf El Nour, IOM

Since 2001, the Institute of International Humanitarian Affairs at Fordham University has - in addition to running the humanitarian studies and training programs at Fordham University - focused on cross-cutting issues, and, today, migration and climate change are key areas.

“This MoU is an opportunity to work with the UN agency, IOM, which focuses on migration as well as a serious Saudi university which is currently looking at migration, especially in that part of the world.” - Brendan Cahill, Executive Director, IIHA.

The topic of migration not only focuses on how and why people migrate but also initiates research and education on border management. The IOM/NAUSS/Fordham University MoU will primarily focus on these areas in Arab countries.

“Now that the MoU is signed, we are looking at the specifics of an upcoming conference, which students and alumni will be invited to attend.” - Brendan Cahill

The MoU was finalized in March 2025 and will last for five years, after which all parties will re-evaluate the future of the agreement.

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

Institute of International Humanitarian Affairs

Fordham University

Manhattan, New York

12th Floor Lounge

June 10-11, 2024

For two days, sixty-five representatives from interagencies, INGOs, and NGOs gathered to share updates on relief items such as tarpaulins, jerry cans, and mosquito nets - all essential shelter items for those displaced by a crisis. These items are not only necessary for survival but need to be sustainable in order to limit waste. In 2021, it was determined that NFI (non-food items) were only distributed to 32% of the 47.8 million people in need, mainly due to underfunding. The QSE Sub Group sets out to find solutions to this ever growing need that is worldwide.

*“We are using our research and development capacity to design new products that are more sustainable by having a different approach on the technical specification, trying to use less resources, adjust our product specification to the result, and to extend the durability of the product to achieve better results.” - Patrick Oger, head of QSE Sub Group and ICRC Project Manager.*

Since its founding in 2010, the QSE Sub Group has expanded to six interagencies: ICRC, IFRC, IOM, MSF, UNHCR, and UNICEF. The reason for coming together originated from a factory visit in China by UNHCR and ICRC.

Mr. Oger recalls the visit, “* we found out that we were doing the same job. And we concluded that this requires more collaboration. So, we started this group as a collaborative approach of the supply chain together, UNHCR and ICRC. Then rapidly we included our colleagues. The ICRC stands for the International Committee of the Red Cross and the IFRC, the International Federation of Red Cross at Red Crescent and UNICEF. After some years, we extended the group to MSF, Doctors Without Borders, and IOM, the International Office for Migration, because they were also doing the same work as us with the same type of product.” *

The first-of-its-kind-conference included presentations by representatives from the QSE Sub Group, USAID, and Oxfam with a special introduction by Brendan Cahill, Executive Director of the Institute of International Humanitarian Affairs (IIHA) at Fordham University. In December of 2023, Mr. Cahill and Joseph Ashmore, head of QSE Sub Group and Head Preparedness and Response Coordination Support Unit at IOM, met to discuss the possibility of working together on the topic of shelter and hosting a conference this spring. One of the goals of the Sub Group is to involve academia and students, and the IIHA was ultimately selected as an academic partner. Mr. Cahill, expressed the institute’s interest in shelter in his opening remarks, “ *At the heart of standards is equal dignity. Human dignity. We're talking about human rights. We're talking about protection in all of its forms and that sits at the very center of the Institute’s mission.” *

Although summer break has kicked off for Fordham University’s almost 17,000 students, a group of ten students, alumni, and faculty attended the conference like Lauren Larsen, an International Political Economy and Humanitarian Studies Senior:

*“This week, I was privileged to attend “Twenty-five years of Experimentation and Innovation: Quality, Social, and Environmental Concerns in Relief Items Procurement. I learned a tremendous amount about technical specification and harmonization, emerging research and development of new products (like the geodesic tent), sustainability and social considerations to goods manufacturing, benefits and challenges of local purchase, and the importance of quality inspection services. I was grateful for the chance to speak directly with people from various organizations, including those outside of the working group like** **Catholic Relief Services**,** **USAID**, and** **CARE** who have a wealth of experience in the humanitarian sector.”*

Throughout the two-day conference, the agenda highlighted unified technical specifications, research and development, sustainability, local purchase, and also five breakout sessions for sharing updates and knowledge and brainstorming solutions to common procurement issues.

While the conference has concluded with many takeaways, the work has yet to finish. A report based on the conference presentations and discussions as well as a video with interviews will be disseminated within the next two weeks.

Rose Hill campus

October 2, 2024

Stella Rose missed class for a good reason last week. She was invited to speak on the Youth for Disarmament and Denuclearization panel during the 79th UN General Assembly.

Stella was excited to reference her MSHS class notes during her preparation and used them throughout her talk. She is currently a dual graduate student (Master of Science in Humanitarian Studies and International Relations and Affairs and Theology) at Fordham University.

**From her LinkedIn prior to the event:**

“Looking forward to high-level week at the[ United Nations](https://www.linkedin.com/company/united-nations/) next week has me feeling nostalgic! Reflecting on my statement during the 78th Session of the United Nations General Assembly at the 7th session of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Open-ended working group.

It is always such a surreal feeling to actualize my dream of contributing my thoughts at the UN from the youth perspective. Attached below is a copy of my statement stressing that in the Nuclear Age, cybersecurity is critical: not just for the right to privacy but for the safeguards of our weapons systems. In my deliverance, I hoped to highlight pressing issues like cyber warfare, the vulnerabilities of security networks, and the necessary application of the UN Charter and International Humanitarian Law to the possibility of use of ICTs during armed conflicts.

"The threat of nuclear war is subject to the sophistication of security systems that protect weapons software from hacking. These systems are fallible. Softwares for the most sophisticated institutions have endured continued breaches. Relying on luck to prevent accidental nuclear weapons launches is a strategy that continually threatens our existence. I excitedly anticipate this year’s discussions at the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly surrounding the global effort to accelerate progress towards the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as well as the Summit of the Future.”

**During the Event this year at the 79th UNGA: **

Stella kicks things off at 6:25 with the basics of nuclear disarmament and the costs our world faces:

“ The cost of maintenance of the nuclear weapons is $91.4 billion. Nuclear weapons are not just an existential threat but a monetary drain.”

On sustainable development:

“So long as the U.S. is going to partake in our modernization efforts throughout the next decade…we are going to see excess amounts of nuclear waste. Nuclear waste is not something we know how to deal with.”

Humanitarian Advocacy and nuclear disarmament:

“We’re putting a much larger emphasis on weaponry than we are on the planet and the people.”

“Making it a public concern is somewhere we can start.”

**Experts Across Disciplines Examine Immigration and Border Governance at Multinational Symposium Press Contact: Jane Martinez **

[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or (862) 216-3388.

Representatives of international organizations, including law enforcement officials, diplomats, government officials, and academics will meet at Fordham University’s Lincoln Center campus on September 9 through 11 to examine the intersection of migration, community engagement, law enforcement, and the psychological impact of migration on communities and security personnel.

A cooperative effort among Fordham’s Institute of International Humanitarian Affairs (IIHA) and the Naif Arab University for Security Sciences, supported by the International Organization For Migrations (IOM), the symposium will also address the integration of artificial intelligence and digital tools in policing, the economic and social impacts of migration on local communities, and successful international models of migration management, with a focus on the link between migrants and the structures and agencies responsible for migration across the mobility continuum.

The symposium is the first project resulting from a Memorandum of Understanding signed by Fordham University, the International Organization For Migration in Saudi Arabia, and Naif Arab University for Security Sciences in March of this year, laying the foundations for academic, scientific, and educational collaboration on topics of mutual interest.

To learn more about the symposium and to RSVP, visit the IIHA's Constant Contact page.
