FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

BRONX, NY - FORDHAM UNIVERSITY’S INSTITUTE OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS FINALIZES MoU WITH IOM - UN MIGRATION AGENCY AND NAIF ARAB UNIVERSITY FOR SECURITY SCIENCES (NAUSS), SAUDI ARABIA

Last week, representatives from Fordham University, IOM, and NAUSS signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), encouraging faculty, staff, and students from all parties to look closely at international migration and migration issues. The MoU will allow interested participants to engage in research, conferences, training, and student opportunities. Representatives who signed the MoU include Ellen Fahey-Smith, Fordham University Vice Provost; Dr. Khaled Alassiri, NAUSS Vice President for External Relations; and Ashraf El Nour, IOM Head of Office in Saudi Arabia.

“The agreement is something that we are all happy about and is not the end but is the start of building and furthering knowledge on migration.” - Ashraf El Nour, IOM

Since 2001, the Institute of International Humanitarian Affairs at Fordham University has - in addition to running the humanitarian studies and training programs at Fordham University - focused on cross-cutting issues, and, today, migration and climate change are key areas.

“This MoU is an opportunity to work with the UN agency, IOM, which focuses on migration as well as a serious Saudi university which is currently looking at migration, especially in that part of the world.” - Brendan Cahill, Executive Director, IIHA.

The topic of migration not only focuses on how and why people migrate but also initiates research and education on border management. The IOM/NAUSS/Fordham University MoU will primarily focus on these areas in Arab countries.

“Now that the MoU is signed, we are looking at the specifics of an upcoming conference, which students and alumni will be invited to attend.” - Brendan Cahill

The MoU was finalized in March 2025 and will last for five years, after which all parties will re-evaluate the future of the agreement.
