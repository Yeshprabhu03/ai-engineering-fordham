![](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/humanitarian-studies-/image1.jpg)


Our mission is to train and educate current and future aid workers at local, regional, national, and international levels. We accomplish this by hosting humanitarian training courses in various rotating locations around the world, which equip individuals with the tools needed to respond thoughtfully and effectively in times of crisis, conflict, and disaster. We also publish on a wide range of humanitarian topics and regularly host events that further create an increased understanding of global humanitarian crises through critical analysis and shared experiential knowledge.
