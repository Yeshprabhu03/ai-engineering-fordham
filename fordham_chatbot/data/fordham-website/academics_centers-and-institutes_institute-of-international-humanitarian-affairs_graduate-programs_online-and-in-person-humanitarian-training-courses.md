Elective course | In-Person | 3 credits | Wednesdays, 5:30 pm -7:15 pm I LC

Lincoln Center campus: Migration is a growing phenomena which is often at the top of the agenda in the media, political discourse, government policy and public opinion. Unfortunately it is also the source of much misinformation and prejudice. When migration is forced, assistance to those displaced becomes a major focus of activity for humanitarians, their donors, the governments and communities of affected countries. This course will enable students to confidently engage on the issue of migration. In their future careers they will be enabled to interact with policy makers, those who implement policy and external actors in a knowledgeable, evidence based manner, demonstrating leadership and clarity of thought.

HUST 5600 International Humanitarian Law, Policy and Practice (0 to 3 credits)

[HUST 5600 International Humanitarian Law, Policy and Practice (0 to 3 credits)]

Professor Christopher Harland | Elective Course | In-Person | 3 Credits | Fridays, 5:30 pm - 7:15 pm

Rosehill Campus: This course will explore the development and application of International Humanitarian Law (IHL), also known as the law of armed conflict. IHL is a set of

rules that, in times of armed conflict, seeks to protect people who are not or are no longer participating in hostilities, and to restrict the means and methods of warfare. The rules of IHL aim to balance military necessity against fundamental principles of humanity. IHL also provides a normative framework to facilitate the delivery of aid by humanitarian organizations engaged in mitigating the suffering caused by armed conflict. Students will examine treaty law which forms the legal bases for IHL; in particular the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their additional protocols of 1977, in addition to customary international law. Students will study the principles of proportionality, distinction between military objectives and civilian objects and precautions in attack. They will also become familiar with weapons restrictions and prohibitions. Questions to consider throughout the course include: What is international humanitarian law? How is it created, interpreted, applied, and enforced, and how does it evolve? How does it intersect with other branches of public international law, mainly international criminal law and international human rights law? This course will include case studies to illustrate principles and concepts. This course is open to Fordham seniors.
