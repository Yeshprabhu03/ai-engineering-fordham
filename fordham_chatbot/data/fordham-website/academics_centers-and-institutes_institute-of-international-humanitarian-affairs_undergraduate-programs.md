### Humanitarian Studies Major and Minor

The Humanitarian Studies Programs offers both a Major and Minor track. The course of study, outlined below, balances the theoretical examination of key humanitarian issues with opportunities for practical application exercises, specifically through the Evolution of Development and Humanitarian Aid Systems (HUST 3600) and Internship Seminar (HUST 4800).

**What is the Humanitarian Studies Program at Fordham University? **

The Humanitarian Studies Program (HUST) provides students with the technical knowledge and analytical tools necessary to examine and critique a wide range of humanitarian activities, including food aid, water and sanitation programming, medical assistance, and refugee settlements. The combination of rigorous interdisciplinary coursework and experiential learning opportunities prepare students for a host of graduate studies and careers, such as disaster relief, global public health, human rights, and international law. Additionally, the IIHA’s New York City location provides students with exposure to various United Nations Agencies, the US Mission to the UN, international NGOs, and prominent research institutions.
