**The entirely student-run organisation is dedicated to educating club members, and the greater Fordham community, on humanitarian crises in local, regional, national, and international spheres.**

Principles

1. Inclusion

2. To provide a welcoming space for discussions on political and moral affairs

3. To promote activism and improvements on future humanitarian aide

4. Encourage discussion on any topic of interest

These topics are broad and far reaching, and have already encompassed events on the following topics:

- Gender-based advocacy
- Fundraising for hurricane responses
- Crisis in Yemen
- Migration in Central America
- Denuclearization
- Crisis Response Simulation
- Forced Displacement
- Food Insecurity
- Tour of the United Nations
