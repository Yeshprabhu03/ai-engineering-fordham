Humanitarian Studies Learning Goals

- Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the actors and actions in international responses to humanitarian crises;
- Employ a wide range of disciplines and case studies to examine complex humanitarian emergencies, including natural disaster, famine, war, and pandemic disease;
- Recognize the value of different kinds of knowledge (including both academic and experiential) in formulating appropriate responses to humanitarian crises;
- Critically evaluate the way in which humanitarian interventions are understood and assessed, specifically contrasting the differences between effectiveness, efficiency, outcome, and impact.

Our mission for students in the Humanitarian Studies Program at Fordham extends beyond simply satisfying the course requirements for the major or minor, and the IIHA and their advisor will support them in a number of ways. Students are encouraged to:

- Participate in the life of the humanitarian community at Fordham. Examining contemporary humanitarian issues with their peers through debates, clubs and other activities is an important part of their humanitarian education;
- Cultivate an in-depth knowledge of a specific area of humanitarian assistance through their elective choices, their internship, and - if in the Major - their thesis;
- Consider their professional development and their range of career options while making use of the IIHA’s relationships with practitioners as well as Fordham’s location in New York City.
