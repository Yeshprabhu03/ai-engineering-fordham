### Panel: Religion and Nationalism

*Co-sponsored with the Fordham Center for Religion and Culture*Panelists: José Casanova (Georgetown University), Elizabeth Prodromou (Tufts University), Eric Gregory (Princeton University)

In the Orthodox Christian world, the relation between religion and nationalism has been at the forefront of Orthodox Christian identity since the fall of the Ottoman Empire, for the Orthodox who migrated to such countries as the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Germany during the twentieth century, and now in the post-communist revival of the religion in Russia, Eastern Europe, and Georgia. In the United States, default thinking usually separates religion from national identity, and it is only recently that the elision of the two has emerged to impact public life, especially national elections. Or, is it only recently? Has the current situation simply made more explicit a consistent undercurrent of American identity? Will the presidential campaign be a national moment of reckoning on the relation of religion and nationalism in the US? How does the relation between religion and nationalism in the United States compare with the experience in Orthodox countries? Can anything be learned from the Orthodox encounter with the question of religion and nationalism over the past two centuries? This panel of experts will discuss the similarities and differences of the religion-nationalism dynamic as it is experienced in the United States, the Orthodox Christian world, and beyond.

This episode features an interview with Kristina Stoeckl, professor of sociology at Innsbruck University in Austria. Against an interdisciplinary background of philology, philosophy, international relations and sociology, she has published books and articles on the post-Soviet Russian Orthodox Church and on religion and modernity. Her book The Russian Orthodox Church and Human Rights, 2014, became the starting point for a five year research project funded by the European Research Council. This project, entitled Postsecular Conflicts, has examined the connections between the Russian Orthodox Church and global moral conservative networks of the Christian Right in numerous publications. She is currently working on a monograph (with Dmitry Uzlaner) entitled Moralist International: The Russian Orthodox Church in the Global Culture Wars. Together with Aristotle Papanikolaou and Ingeborg Gabriel, she has edited the volume Political Theologies in Orthodox Christianity. Common Challenges - Divergent Positions, 2017. Her approach to Russian Orthodoxy is that of a comparative political sociology of religions, which puts emphasis on actors and processes in order to understand the complex ways in which religious traditions negotiate their relationship with modernity.

Most scholarly engagements with Orthodox Christianity rest in the fields of theology and history, with little ethnographic focus on the socio-political, everyday lives of Orthodox Christians today. Similarly, anthropology of Orthodoxy is often devoid of theological sensitivity. In an effort to make Orthodox Studies holistic and attuned to the experiences of believers, this panel bringing together theologians and anthropologists of Orthodox Christianity to think through the social life of religious concepts and the future of the field. Orthodoxy is not a tradition of the past, but rather is forged by the challenges of the modern world and the debates of contemporary life.

The Oriental Orthodox Studies Seminar on The Church for Academia: Bridging Scholarship with Ecclesiastical Life aims to discover the ways to engage scholarship with the Church. The gulf between academia and the life of the average lay person often remains wide; formative study and the Church many times are perceived as two distinct worlds that should not and cannot merge. However, the academy and the Church can each contribute towards the others enrichment and growth.

To bridge the two, some questions must first be addressed:

- What are some steps both the academy and the Church can take to engage with the other?
- How can the specialization of academia, found at the highest bookshelves, fall into the hands of the average church goer? And the celebrant?
- Is it the Church’s vision and responsibility to lead members in the field of academia for the enhancement of the Church?
- How can the Church officially integrate and sanction its members who are in the academy or in the pursuit of it?
- Can a structure be established, particularly for non-ordained leaders, including women. If so, how?
- What challenges does or can the Church face in establishing a set structure for such positions?
- How can the Church be prepared for ‘church-academics’?

### A Lecture by Alberto Camplani, Sapienza University of Rome


Introduced by Donna Rizk, Fordham UniversityTuesday Dec 5 | 6 p.m. | 12th Floor Lounge | Lincoln Center Campus


This lecture will propose a new contextualization of fourth- and fifth-century Egyptian Christian debates about the human being “in the image of God” (Gen 1:26-27), by locating them within broader intellectual and institutional tensions in the Egyptian church and highlighting the originality of the Coptic contribution. The controversies surrounded such issues as the place of God’s image in the human compound; the image’s permanence after the fall of Adam and Eve; the role of the body in higher forms of prayer and mysticism; and the significance of anthropomorphic expressions found in the Bible. The sources analyzed will include Greek fragments by Theophilus and Cyril of Alexandria as well as a number of Coptic texts (either translated from Greek or directly composed in Coptic) such as Melito’s On the Soul and the Body, two of Shenute’s sermons, the anonymous Life of Aphu (a bishop of Oxyrhynchus and monk), and the works attributed to Agathonicus of Tarsus.

American Evangelical and Russian actors—both from the Kremlin and the Russian Orthodox Church—are forming alliances to support “traditional values” against "political liberalism," and each for their own purposes: ;American Evangelicals are attempting to influence the political and cultural landscape of the US; the Russians are forging a new East-West cultural cold war. This panel session will explore the political, social, and religious dimensions of this new alliance that has geo-political implications.

### The 2017 Orthodoxy in America Lecture

#### Presented by David Bentley Hart

Research Fellow at The Notre Dame Institute for Advanced Study

September 26 | 6 p.m. |12th-Floor Lounge | E. Gerald Corrigan Conference Center | Lowenstein Center | 113 West 60th Street | New York City


This lecture will reflect on the degree to which Orthodoxy in America, under pressure from convert communities and the society as a whole, might be seen as bringing about a new phase in Orthodox identity, or even (for both good and ill) a new Orthodox synthesis. Is the emerging American expression of Orthodoxy truly Orthodox, or is it more truly American? Or, conversely, is Orthodox identity a single thing, or does it emerge anew in every new cultural setting?

## Out of the Flames: Preserving the Manuscript Heritage of Endangered Syriac Christianity in the Middle East

## Syriac Studies Series of the Orthodox Christian Studies Center

### Lecture presented by Columba Stewart, OSB

Professor of Theology and Executive Director of the Hill Museum and Manuscript Library (HMML)


Saint John’s University### Introduction by Gerald Blaszczak, SJ

Director of the Center for Ignatian Spirituality


Fairfield UniversityMonday, February 6, 2017 | 6 p.m. | South Lounge | Lowenstein Building Plaza Level


Fordham University Lincoln Center Campus | 113 West 60th Street | New York City

The Syriac Christians of Mesopotamia (modern Iraq, Syria, and southeast Turkey) are among the most vulnerable of minority cultures in the current Middle Eastern crisis. Their culture is ancient and its manuscript heritage is among the richest in the Christian world. Dr. Columba Stewart, OSB, a Benedictine monk as well as one of the world’s leading experts in Syriac Christianity, has written extensively on early monastic history and on exchanges among Syriac, Greek, and Latin monastic cultures. For more than a decade he has led a major effort to preserve the manuscript heritage of Christians and Muslim communities threatened by war and globalization.

This lecture will describe the significance of Syriac Christianity as a counterpoint to historically dominant Greek and Latin Christian cultures, with a particular focus on the manuscripts that embody and represent Syriac heritage. It will also describe current efforts to preserve and share those precious manuscript witnesses in the face of determined efforts to destroy them.

We are pleased to welcome back to Fordham University the Reverend Gerald Blaszczak, SJ, who will provide the introduction. “Father Gerry,” as he is known, was a catalyst in the creation of the Orthodox Christian Studies program at Fordham University.

### Lecture presented by Valentina Izmirlieva

Chair, Department of Slavic Languages


Columbia University### Respondents:

### Sarit Kattan Gribetz

Assistant Professor of Theology


Fordham University### Ebru Turan

Assistant Professor of History


Fordham UniversityWednesday, March 8, 2017 | 6 p.m. | O’Hare Special Collections Room | Walsh Library 4th Floor


Fordham University Rose Hill Campus | 441 East Fordham Road | Bronx, NY 10458

From the 17th to the 19th centuries in the European part of the Ottoman Empire, Orthodox Christian pilgrims to Jerusalem took as their model the Muslim Hajj to Mecca. These paradoxical Christian pilgrims called themselves “hajjis,” using an Islamic honorific, but insisted on their Eastern Orthodox identity and the Orthodox ethos of their quest. Valentina Izmirlieva’s research addresses religious coexistence and cultural exchange among Christians, Jews, and Muslims in the context of multi-ethnic and multi-religious empires.

Join Fordham professors Sarit Kattan Gribetz and Ebru Turan as Dr. Izmirlieva shares the story of how the Orthodox Hajj to Jerusalem emerged from within Muslim Ottoman culture as a Christian family project; and further, as a surprising vehicle for female mobility, creativity, and empowerment.

## Syriac Studies Series of the Orthodox Christian Studies Center

### Lecture by Muriel Debié

École Pratique des Hautes Études

Monday, April 3 ,2017 | 6 p.m. | O'Hare Special Collections Room, Walsh Library | Rose Hill Campus


Syriac non-Orthodox literature offers a view of the seventh century that differs from the one presented by Byzantine Orthodox and Islamic sources. Questioning the Sasanid and then Arab “conquests” as well as the “canonized” periodization, this lecture will share how Syriac texts offer a alternate understanding of a period we still perceive as a turning point in the history of the region and the world.

Dr. Muriel Debié, Professor at the École Pratique des Hautes Études in Paris, is currently a Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies. She is a world-renowned expert in Syriac Studies, and particularly of Syriac historiography.

The Orthodox Christian Studies Center of Fordham University is pleased to host the academic sessions of this international and interdisciplinary conference, bringing together scholars from diverse fields (music, theology, sacred acoustics/sound studies, architecture, religious studies, philosophy, et al.), as well as artists experienced in the performance and recording of Pärt’s music, to create a unique forum for the exchange of ideas, research, practices and creativity on the topics of sound and the sacred.

The music of Estonian composer Arvo Pärt is frequently connected with experiences of the sacred. Although the composer’s religious affiliation is specifically Orthodox Christian, his music and its impact carry an appeal beyond confessional and religious boundaries. His popularity crosses over customary distinctions between classical and popular music, sacred and secular art, liturgical space and concert hall.

The unique impact of Pärt’s music has been explored musicologically—and more recently through the lens of spirituality— but not yet in terms of the more basic elements of sound and embodiment. Through a two-fold approach, with more or less direct relationship to the Pärt repertoire, the conference seeks to break new ground exploring primary questions around how music achieves its visceral and spiritual effect on human beings through the materiality of the movement of air impressing itself on the human body.

Affiliated events may be held at nearby venues. This conference is open to the public.

## The 2016 Annual Orthodoxy in America Lecture

### Presented by Vera Shevzov

Professor of Religion, Smith College

### Introduction by Anna Meyendorff

Tuesday, September 27, 2016 | 6 p.m. | 12th-Floor Lounge | E. Gerald Corrigan Conference Center


Lowenstein Center | 113 West 60th Street | New York City

At the age of 26, the future Biblical scholar, prolific author, translator, and founding editor of one of the most well-known Biblical commentaries in pre-revolutionary Russia—the so-called Lopukhin Bible—Alexander Pavlovich Lopukhin (1852-1904) arrived in New York City from St. Petersburg, Russia. Fluent in English and assigned as a lay reader to the small Orthodox community attached to the Russian Consulate in New York City, the young Lopukhin spent two years closely observing life in America. His stay subsequently resulted in a travelogue, numerous essays, and public lectures in Russia on religious life in the United States, as well as a dissertation on Roman Catholicism in America. This talk will examine this Orthodox scholar's sometimes surprising and lively reflections on religion in America and consider his observations in light of a historically persistent Orthodox Occidentalism.
