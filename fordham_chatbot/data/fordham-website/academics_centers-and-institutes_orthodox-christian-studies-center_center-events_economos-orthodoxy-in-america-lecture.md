# Economos Orthodoxy in America Lecture

The *Christ and Anastasia* *Economos **Orthodoxy in America Lecture* at Fordham University is the largest annual lecture of its kind and the only one housed within a university setting. In addition, the annual lecture series is the only one to explore the Orthodox tradition as it intersects with the American religious experience. And since it is housed within a Roman Catholic institution, the lecture series provides an unparalleled opportunity for an advanced ecumenical conversation about the common issues facing the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic traditions.

More information about our previous lectures is included below. Many lectures are also viewable on the [Center’s YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCk05ipCQeKISDzzR_K_E7Q). In addition, text from the lectures from 2018 onward can be found in the [Center’s Journal of Orthodox Christian Studies](https://muse.jhu.edu/journal/719).

## Upcoming Lecture

**Reclaiming "Orthodoxy": Clarifying Our Ecclesial Vocabulary**

Presented by **Sr. Vassa Larin**, professor of practical theology at the Kyiv Orthodox Theological Academy and host of the “Coffee with Sister Vassa” online catechetical programs.**Wednesday, October 29Reception 5 p.m. | Lecture 6 p.m.Fordham University | Rose Hill CampusThe Great Hall | McShane Campus Center **

*GPS Address:*2691 Southern Blvd., Bronx, NY 10458

In this lecture, Sister Vassa will address the issue of popular misconceptions about several basic terms of Orthodox Christian faith. Basic terms such as ‘orthodoxy,’ ‘church,’ ‘catholic,’ and ‘canonicity,’ when used inaccurately, distort the vision of our common vocation not only as Orthodox or Catholic Christians, but as human beings. That common human vocation, according to Maximos the Confessor, is to unite, rather than divide; to manifest through ourselves “the great mystery of the divine purpose: the union with each other..., culminating in union with God.” (*Ambiguum *41, I).

## Past Lectures

-
**Building an Alliance of Grace: Ecumenism in an Age of Anxiety**Joseph M. McShane, SJ

October 1, 2024

1964 was a turning point in the relationship between the Eastern and Western churches. That’s when His All Holiness Patriarch Athenagoras and His Holiness Pope Paul VI committed themselves to the Lord’s mandated work of reconciliation. While progress toward reunification has been slower than we might have hoped, the two churches have never abandoned the dream that Athenagoras and Paul shared.

The work of ecumenical dialogue became more urgent with the elections of Patriarch Bartholomew and Pope Francis. Through their shared sense of the Christian mission, they have found greater and greater unity in and through service to the world, especially the most vulnerable among God’s children. In the process, they have formed “an alliance of grace.” The challenge is to keep that alliance alive in the world today.

**A Vanishing Point: Unity in Orthodoxy and the Ukraine Crisis**Dr. Nadieszda Kizenko, The University at Albany

Until recently, it was possible to describe Orthodoxy as “unity in plurality.” Although Orthodoxy consisted of over a dozen local churches with a wide variety of local practices and without an overarching structure, body, or person, it was still possible to say that Orthodoxy was a relatively well-functioning church—indeed, one Church. In the last decades, and especially the last decade, however, profound fissures have undermined that unity. The Holy and Great Council of the Orthodox Church in Crete, the Ecumenical Patriarchate’s granting of autocephaly to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, and Russia’s full-scale attack on Ukraine—all have exposed deeper fault lines in World Orthodoxy. These include issues of church and state (Symphonia), church and nation, how to achieve consensus, authority in the Church, how one approaches history, and the attitude to human rights and modernity in general. How can Orthodoxy face these challenges?

## Presenting Byzantium in the Modern World

### Helen Evans, Ph.D.


Mary and Michael Jaharis Curator of Byzantine Art at the Metropolitan Museum of ArtOctober 23, 2018


Today, as the study of the past is questioned, it is critical to consider ways to present Byzantium so that the relevance of its art, religion, and culture are recognized in the modern world. Exhibitions using the visual voice of the empire and its related cultures can demonstrate the inaccuracy of Edward Gibbon’s long-lasting, negative definition of the state. This talk considers modern presentations of Byzantine art with special emphasis on American contributions to effectively defining the lasting importance of the empire the Romans ruled from Constantinople from 330 to 1453.Read about the event on

### Orthodoxy in America and America's Orthodoxies

#### Presented by David Bentley Hart


Research Fellow at The Notre Dame Institute for Advanced StudySeptember 26, 2017


This lecture reflects on the degree to which Orthodoxy in America, under pressure from convert communities and the society as a whole, might be seen as bringing about a new phase in Orthodox identity, or even (for both good and ill) a new Orthodox synthesis. Is the emerging American expression of Orthodoxy truly Orthodox, or is it more truly American? Or, conversely, is Orthodox identity a single thing, or does it emerge anew in every new cultural setting?
