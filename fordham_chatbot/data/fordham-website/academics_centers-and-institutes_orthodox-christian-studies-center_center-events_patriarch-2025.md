## About the Ecumenical Patriarch

His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew is the 270th successor to the Apostle Andrew and spiritual leader of the world’s 300 million Orthodox Christians. Known as the “Green Patriarch,” His All-Holiness has taken the lead among religious leaders in his concern for protecting the environment, initiating many seminars, conferences, and dialogues on the religious need to promote harmony between humanity and nature.

Born on the island of Imvros (Turkey) in 1940, the Ecumenical Patriarch graduated from the Theological School of Halki and was ordained to the diaconate that same year. From 1963 to 1968, he pursued postgraduate studies in Canon Law at the Pontifical Oriental Institute of the Gregorian University in Rome, receiving a doctorate for his dissertation “Concerning the Codification of the Sacred Canons and Canonical Regulations in the Orthodox Church.” He was ordained to the priesthood in 1969 and, following 19 years of service to his predecessor, Ecumenical Patriarch Dimitrios, he was elected to the Ecumenical Throne on October 22, 1991.

Since his enthronement, His All-Holiness has pursued a vision of Orthodox unity, Christian reconciliation, and interreligious tolerance. As a strong advocate for ecumenical dialogue between churches, he has been a member of the World Council of Churches Faith and Order Commission since 1975 and served as its vice president for eight years. In addition to the environmental and ecumenical efforts of the “Green Patriarch,” His All-Holiness has also been a tireless global champion of religious freedom and human rights.
