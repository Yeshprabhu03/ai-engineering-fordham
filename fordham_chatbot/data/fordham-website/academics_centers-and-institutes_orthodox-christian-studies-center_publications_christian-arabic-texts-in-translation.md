The goal of this new series is to provide a forum for making the Christian Arabic literary heritage more widely available in the English-speaking world. Individual volumes are meant to be affordable, published in small paperback format (typically less than 200 pages), and designed to give those who cannot read Arabic exposure to selections drawn from the rich range of Christian Arabic texts and genres, including biblical commentaries, church canons, histories and chronicles, theological and ascetic treatises, saints’ lives and sermons, liturgical documents, philosophical works, and scientific handbooks. The chronological focus of *Christian Arabic Texts in Translation *will extend from the rise of Islam to the present, but with a special emphasis on the medieval golden age of Christian literature produced in the Arabic language. The translations will be accessible to a general educated readership and suitable for undergraduate teaching, while the accompanying introductions and notes will make the volumes useful for graduate-level research.

Proposals for future volumes and manuscript submissions are welcome. If you have any questions, please contact the editor at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f2818697829a979cdc9693849b81b28b939e97dc979687).
