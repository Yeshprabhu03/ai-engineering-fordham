[Fordham College at Lincoln Center](/fordham-college-at-lincoln-center/)

The arts that shape our culture. The financial powerhouses that define global commerce. The media that inform our daily lives. New York City is an international capital for each - and as a student at FCLC, you’ll be near some of the world’s biggest players in these industries.

Your classes will take advantage of that proximity to put you in newsrooms, to visit museums, to stage your own production as part of FringeNYC. No matter what you study, New York City will be part of your curriculum. You’ll find a particular bent to global education here that is especially fitting given our surroundings. And some programs, such as dance and theatre, are available only here.

[Fordham College at Rose Hill](/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/)

You’ll hear that Rose Hill is best for students who want a typical, “traditional” college campus. But there’s nothing typical about the education you’ll get here. Small classes mean you’ll connect one-on-one with faculty and mentors and immerse yourself in a research culture that would be off-limits to all but a select few at a larger institution.

That intimate, small-class experience also opens you up to the life-changing resources that are all over the city. Biology students may do work at the New York Botanical Garden (or at Fordham’s own Calder Center research station, not far from the Bronx.) Archaeology students may do research in Alaska and chemistry students at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. In recent years economics majors have done analysis for JPMorgan Chase & Co. And FCRH students in other fields have authored or co-authored pieces in dozens of academic journals and won scores of fellowships.

[Gabelli School of Business](/gabelli-school-of-business/)

The breadth of a classic business education. The proximity of an international business capital. Get both with the Gabelli School of Business located at both Fordham’s Lincoln Center and Rose Hill campuses.

You’ll also get the kind of hands-on experience that make you more than just another face on LinkedIn: Head to India as you import and sell Fair Trade products. Help invest $1 million of Fordham funds with our student-managed fund. And explore the art of building your own enterprise as part of our *Business Week*-ranked entrepreneurship program.

[School of Professional and Continuing Studies](/school-of-professional-and-continuing-studies/)

Fordham's School of Professional and Continuing Studies was created specifically for adult students to complete their bachelor’s degree or begin their studies wherever they are in life. Our adult curriculum combines the strengths of Fordham’s core curriculum, which introduces you to the Jesuit intellectual tradition, with Fordham’s breadth of strong undergraduate majors, ranging from philosophy and English, to business and organizational leadership.

And of course, our programs are offered in a format suited to your busy lives as parents, employees, and adults, with evening, weekend, and on-line classes.

We offer more than a dozen undergraduate majors, as well as post baccalaureate and accelerated programs and non-credit courses at all three of Fordham's campuses — in Manhattan, the Bronx, and Westchester.
