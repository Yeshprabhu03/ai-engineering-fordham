American Studies is the interdisciplinary study of the United States and its impact as a global power. Our [majors and minors](/academics/departments/american-studies/major-and-minor/) enter into individualized programs of study to analyze American cultures, ideas, and institutions through a variety of disciplines.

Drawing on our unique location in New York City, and on the expertise of our affiliated faculty in departments as varied as African and African American Studies, Art and Music History, Communications and Media Studies, English, History, Philosophy, Political Science, Sociology and Anthropology and Theology, our students each develop a capstone senior thesis project that brings together their research interests in a public symposium.

Students majoring in American Studies enjoy the experience of studying in a small cohort, with opportunities to build a community around their passion for understanding the culture and politics of American life in a climate of creative inquiry and collaborative engagement. They go on to careers in law, media, government and public service, the non-profit sector, to name just a few.

Given the individualized program of study offered by American Studies, admission to the program is competitive, and is based on writing and analytical skills, faculty recommendation, and GPA in cognate disciplines. Students seeking to join American Studies are encouraged to contact the [program's director](/academics/departments/american-studies/contact-us/) to obtain an application.
