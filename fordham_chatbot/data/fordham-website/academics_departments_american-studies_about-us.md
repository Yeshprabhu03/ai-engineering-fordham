## What are the benefits of working in the field of American Studies?

Students within the field of American Studies gain a deep understanding of the United States and its complexity. The course of study is rooted in a historical perspective on America. The American Studies student analyzes American history and experience in order to develop insight into the multiplicity of cultures, ideas, and institutions that make up the nation. Majors acquire many of the same skills which emerge in a traditional humanities or social science major, most notably analytical abilities and strong writing.

Along with these skills, American Studies students gain an additional interdisciplinarity, enabling majors to make connections between diverse fields and subjects. Students develop the ability to apply this historically-grounded, multidisciplinary knowledge of the United States to a variety of contemporary areas, including politics, economics, social issues, and culture. Finally, in putting together such a wide-ranging course of study, American Studies majors demonstrate individual initiative and the capacity for self-direction.
