### What types of internships, fellowships, and study abroad opportunities are available for American Studies majors?

American Studies students are often very active beyond their traditional academic program at Fordham. Students are encouraged to examine all points of views concerning America, including those by people or peoples who do not live within its borders. Therefore, students who wish to do so are encouraged to study abroad. American Studies students have studied American culture from as far away as the University of Melbourne in Australia, Oxford and Cambridge Universities in England, the University of the City of Dublin in Ireland, and the University of Florence in Italy, to name just a few options.

Many students decide to intensify their study without leaving the country. During the school year and over the summer, many students work in internships and apply for fellowships that deepen their knowledge in their particular areas of interest. Students have interned in a variety of fields; our talented American Studies majors have found positions in politics, law, journalism, theatres, museums, service, and non-profit organizations, among others.

In addition, many students apply to and receive major national fellowships including Fulbright, Madison, Truman, and New York Urban Fellowships. As you can see, the American Studies program is extremely flexible and student have many choices for internships, fellowships, and travel.
