# Art History Awards and Scholarships

### An annual book award for outstanding students.

Each year, the art history faculty presents a book award to two students--one from Fordham College Rose Hill, one from Fordham College Lincoln Center-- who have outstanding academic records in the program. Book awards are made at the Vasari Lecture in the spring, and the FCRH award is announced at the Encaenia ceremony in May.

Also, be sure to view information on the other awards and scholarships.

## Marion Scholarship
