### Biography

Nina Rowe specializes in the art of northern Europe in the high and late Middle Ages (twelfth to fifteenth century). Her recent research examines illuminated World Chronicle (*Weltchronik*) manuscripts, created in southern Germany and Austria circa 1330 to 1430. Another facet of her scholarship examines images of Jews and Judaism in settings ranging from monumental cathedral façade sculpture to hand-held carved ivories. Her scholarship also addresses the production and reception of illuminated manuscripts in the medieval and modern eras.

Professor Rowe’s research has been supported by fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities (2016-17), the American Council of Learned Societies (2016-17), and the Metropolitan Museum of Art (2007-8). She was awarded the Karen Gould Prize from the Medieval Academy of America in 2023 for her book *The Illuminated World Chronicle: Tales from the Late Medieval City *(Yale UP, 2020). She served as President of the International Center of Medieval Art (ICMA), 2020-23.
