Some internships earn students college credits. Some internships are paid. Most internships involve 10-20 hours of work per week.

Students must register their internship with the [Fordham Career Center](https://www.fordham.edu/resources/career-resources/career-center/) and consult with their Academic Advisor about their plans.

Students are expected to have completed a minimum of 60 hours of course work and hold a GPA of 3.0 or above in order to be approved for college credit. (Exceptions can be made for students in good academic standing.)

Be aware that art world internships are very competitive. Applying for and securing an internship often takes 3-4 months and requires initiative and professionalism on the part of the student. The Fordham Career Center can help you compose a resumé and guide you through the process. Art History professors also can offer advice and tips for success. We are here to help!

While it can be challenging to land an internship, the process of seeking, applying for, interviewing for, and holding the internship itself provide outstanding preparation for the job hunt after graduation. Experience gained and connections made through undergraduate internships often are springboards to future careers.
