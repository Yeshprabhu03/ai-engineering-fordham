# Accelerated Master's Program in Biological Sciences

The GSAS Accelerated Master's Program allows selected Biological Sciences majors to obtain both their B.S. degree and M.S. degree in five years. (B.S. after four years and M.S. after five years). The GSAS Accelerated Master's Program is offered to Fordham College students with a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher. Interested students must apply by the time they register for the fall semester of their senior year but are encouraged to apply earlier. Candidates will begin their graduate studies in their senior year and will carry elective credits in the summer between their fourth and fifth years. As part of the M.S., the student must complete four core courses and pass a comprehensive examination in their area of specialization after completion of core courses.

**Core courses**

For cell/molecular biology: Eukaryotes Molecular Biology, Cell Biology of Eukaryotes

For ecology and systematics: Population and Community Biology, Community and Ecosystem Ecology

**Cell/Molecular Biology **

In the fall of their senior year, students will take BISC 7502 Eukaryotic Molecular Biology and BISC 7801 Methods in Cell/Molecular Biology. In the spring of their senior year, students will take BISC 6734 Cell Biology of Eukaryotes and BISC 7804 Techniques in Cell/Molecular Biology.

**Ecology and Systematics **

In the fall of their senior year, students will take BISC 7501 Population and Community Biology and BISC 7801 Methods in Cell/Molecular Biology. In the spring of their senior year, students will take BISC 7503 Community and Ecosystem Ecology plus an elective.
