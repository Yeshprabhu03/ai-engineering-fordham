The CUE focuses on the ecology of urban landscapes and relationships between land use patterns, human impacts, and disease emergence. We are located in the heart of a well-defined urban-to-rural landscape gradient that has been under study for more than 20 years and offers opportunities to examine the effects of changing human population density on plant and animal populations, as well as on the emergence of zoonoses and vector-borne diseases.
