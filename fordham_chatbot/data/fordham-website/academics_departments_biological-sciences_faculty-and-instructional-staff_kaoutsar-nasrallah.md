The Nasrallah Lab explores the cellular mechanisms underlying basic brain function (e.g. memory) and brain disorders (e.g. epilepsy), primarily focusing on the role of tonic inhibition. Although inhibitory neurons represent only ~10-20% of the total neuronal population, they regulate virtually all aspects of cellular and circuit function. Most studies investigating the role of GABA, i.e. main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, have focused on phasic inhibition, which is mediated by synaptic GABAA and GABAB receptors. However, GABA also activates peri- and extrasynaptic GABAARs which can sense low concentration of ambient GABA and generate persistent tonic inhibitory currents. This unique form of inhibition, known as tonic inhibition, is crucial in controlling information processing and behavior. Nevertheless, very little is known about whether and how GABAAR tone is regulated in specific neurons during cognitive processes and brain disorders.

Depending on the cell type and the brain region, tonic inhibition is predominantly mediated by the non-synaptic δ- and α5-containing GABAARs (δ-GABAARs and α5-GABAARs, respectively). Interestingly, δ-GABAARs are particularly sensitive to steroids and can be modulated, for instance, in response to hormonal fluctuation and during epilepsy. In the hippocampus, a structure critically implicated in learning, spatial navigation, anxiety and epilepsy, functional δ-GABAARs are particularly enriched in both excitatory dentate granule cells (GCs) and inhibitory interneurons. Importantly, tonic δ-GABAARs play a crucial role in memory, stress-related behavior, epilepsy, schizophrenia and mood disorders. Yet, the precise role of δ-GABAARs-mediated inhibition in specific cell types remain elusive.

Our main goals are to determine:

- How δ-GABAARs-mediated inhibition is modulated by learning and diseases states, in specific cell types and brain regions
- The precise role of δ-GABAARs expressed by specific neurons in memory formation, epilepsy and neuropsychiatric diseases

To this end, we combine cutting-edge tools with different levels of analysis, from single cell, neuro-circuit levels to behavior. These approaches include well-established models of epilepsy and learning paradigms, markers of neuronal activity in vivo, cell type-selective conditional knock-out (KO) of δ-GABAARs, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and slice electrophysiology in mice. Knowledge generated by our projects can be crucial to develop future therapeutic strategies, using cell type-specific manipulations, which will likely have higher efficiency and fewer side effects than current treatments.
