The Turo lab studies the causes and consequences of biodiversity change in the Anthropocene. A central theme of the lab’s work is Reconciliation Ecology, or the advancement of land management strategies to satisfy human needs while conserving biodiversity and healthy ecosystem functioning. As such, our conservation research is frequently based in anthropogenic landscapes, including forested, agricultural and urban systems, and we integrate human dimensions into our work.

As a model system, we often work with plant-pollinator communities. Pollinators have complex responses to global change, provide important ecosystem services, and there is growing concern about global bee decline. Plant-pollinator interactions also represent one of the most fascinating ecological relationships—mutualisms. Our lab combines large-scale field studies with molecular and quantitative tools to ask basic and applied questions about native bee communities, species interactions, foraging behavior, landscape processes, and conservation practices. We frequently partner with non-profits like The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation and The Audubon Society.

Current grants in the lab focus on native bees in northeastern deciduous forests and ask questions like, (1) which forest plants are important forage for bees? (2) what is the extent of mutualistic asymmetry between the plants that bees feed on and those they pollinate? And (3) how do wild bee communities respond to timber harvesting across large spatial and temporal scales? Dr. Turo also has research interests in urban bee ecology and conservation (see Publications) and we are excited to begin partnering with local urban farms in New York City to co-create research that benefits community


development.**The Turo Lab is actively recruiting graduate students to join us in Fall 2026, and we encourage interested students to contact Dr. Turo about research and funding opportunities.**
