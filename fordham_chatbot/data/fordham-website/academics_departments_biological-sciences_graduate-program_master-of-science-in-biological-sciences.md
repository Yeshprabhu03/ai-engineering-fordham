How do birds navigate through urban landscapes? How do plants respond to climate change? Can the human papilloma virus, responsible for 99 percent of cervical cancers, be stopped? Can the biomarkers for serious psychiatric disorders be identified before they take hold?

At Fordham, our graduate students are in the lab and out in the field, seeking solutions to these questions and more. Our master of science program provides a unique cross-disciplinary experience that will increase your versatility, grounding you in cutting-edge molecular tools and techniques as well as systems biology. You’ll specialize in one of two tracks:

With our strong emphasis on research, we have a successful record of preparing our students for doctoral work at Fordham and other competitive programs.

## Program highlights

- Work closely with faculty mentors
- Access to Fordham’s
[Louis Calder Center Biological Field Station](/about/campuses/the-louis-calder-center/)in Westchester County for research in ecology, evolution, and conservation - State-of-the-art lab facilities in
[Larkin Hall](/academics/departments/biological-sciences/facilities-and-research-centers/larkin-hall/)for research in fields including cell and molecular biology, microbiology, cytogenetics, entomology, and neurobiology

## Program basics

- Designed as a two-year program for full-time students
- Courses are held at Fordham's Rose Hill Campus in the Bronx
- Curriculum requires 34 credits for
[ecology and systematics](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/gsas/biological-sciences/ms/#concentrationstext)and 35 credits for[cell and molecular biology](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/gsas/biological-sciences/ms/#concentrationstext). Both tracks include two core courses in ecology and two core courses in cell and molecular biology in the first year - Comprehensive examination required
