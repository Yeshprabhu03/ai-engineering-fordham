The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, located in John Mulcahy Hall on the Rose Hill campus, offers majors and minors in both chemistry and biochemistry.

Our research faculty investigate a broad range of topics, from nano‑materials to quantum theory, and provide opportunities for motivated undergraduates to participate hands‑on in basic and applied research.

Our program adheres to curriculum standards set by the [American Chemical Society (ACS)](http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en.html) and offers an ACS certified degree for students pursuing a career in chemistry. The department also actively supports a local chapter of [Sigma Xi](http://www.sigmaxi.org/), the scientific research society.
