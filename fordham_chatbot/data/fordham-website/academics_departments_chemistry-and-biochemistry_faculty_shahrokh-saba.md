To develop operationally straightforward and synthetically useful methods for the preparation of nitrogen containing compounds using simple ammonium salts with nucleophilic and non-nucleophilic counterions as reagents. In connection with this theme we have developed one step protocols for the preparation of the following compounds: cyclic amidinium tetrafluoroborates and hexafluorophosphates; ternary and quaternary iminium tetrafluoroborates, hexafluorophosphates, and perchlorates; secondary and tertiary acetamides; alkyl-substituted amine tetrafluoroborate and hexafluorophosphate salts.

- Cyclic amidinium tetrafluoroborates and hexafluorophosphates by treating 1° or 2° diamines with ortho esters in the presence of ammonium tetrafluoroborate or hexafluorophosphate (Tetrahedron Lett. 1991, 32, 5031-5034)
- Ternary and quaternary iminium tetrafluoroborates, hexafluorophosphates, and perchlorates by direct treatment of aldehydes or ketones with 2° amines in the presence of the appropriate ammonium salt (J. Chem. Res. 2008, 301-304)
- Secondary as well as tertiary amines by direct heating an aldehyde or a ketone with an amine in the presence of ammonium formate (Tetrahedron Lett. 2011, 129-132)
- Alkyl-substituted amine tetrafluoroborate and hexafluorophosphate salts by direct heating of amine free bases with ammonium tetrafluoroborate or hexafluorophosphate (J. Fluorine Chem. 2013, 153, 168-171)
- Secondary and tertiary acetamides by converting amine free bases to their hydrochloride salts (by heating amine free bases with ammonium chloride) followed by treatment of the salts with trimethyl orthoacetate (Syn. Comm. 2015, 45, 2601-2607)

Develop discovery-based and pedagogically useful undergraduate organic laboratory experiments to illustrate important features related to molecular structure or chemical reactions. In connection with this theme we have developed the following organic chemistry laboratory experiments:
