## Meet our Alumni!

As a Fordham chemistry student, you can draw from impressive resources – including diverse research opportunities directly with faculty – to earn a degree that is invaluable to your future career. Many of our students go on to graduate programs in the sciences or medicine. Learn a bit about some notable alumni here:

#### Sara Hurley

- Class of '18
- Worked with Prof. Banerjee using drug-loaded nano-assemblies to target cancer cells.
- Now studying at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.

*"My favorite day in the research lab was when I used fluorescence microscopy to see assemblies that I had synthesized attacking and killing cancer cells."*

*"Beyond learning about the science of chemistry and chemical research, through this experience I also learned how to be a researcher. I was able to publish research articles in scientific journals with my mentor and present at national conferences. In the future I hope to go into academic medicine, which involves both taking care of patients and carrying out clinical research."*

#### Stacey Barnaby Ross, Ph.D.

- Class of '11
- Earned a Ph.D from Northwestern University in 2016.
- Currently Scientist II at DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences in Palo Alto, CA.

*"I really enjoyed my time as a chemistry major at Fordham. I loved being part of a small, close-knit department where all the faculty and fellow students were rooting for each other to be successful."*

*"I really have two pieces of advice. First, if you are even remotely considering a career in research, join a lab ASAP. Don't be afraid to ask a professor if you’re interested in joining a lab or just looking to learn more about their research. Second, get to know your professors and classmates. They are all here to help you. If you’re struggling, don’t be afraid to reach out and get help....Science is truly a team sport, and you will be more successful and happy if you work with your fellow chemistry majors and professors instead of trying to succeed in isolation."*
