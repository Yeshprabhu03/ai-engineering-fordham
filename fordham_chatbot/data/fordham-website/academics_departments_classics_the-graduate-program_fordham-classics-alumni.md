#### Dr. Lee Fratantuono

Lee Fratantuono finished degrees in Classics at Holy Cross and Boston College before continuing his Jesuit education at Fordham, where he completed his doctorate in 2002 under the late Robert Carrubba. His dissertation was a commentary on Book XI of Virgil's Aeneid that was later published in a revised version in the Collection Latomus in Belgium. While a graduate student, Fratantuono also worked closely with the late Seth Benardete at New York University through the New York City Classics Consortium. Benardete's advice and encouragement led him to produce his three volume set of commentaries on Virgil, Ovid, and Lucan, the so-called Madness trilogy. Fratantuono is Professor and Chair of Classics at Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio, where he also serves as faculty advisor to the Delta Upsilon chapter of the Delta Delta Delta sorority. Recent scholarly projects include co-editing the Brill Aeneid V (2015) and VIII (forthcoming, 2017), co-editing the Blackwell Companion to imperial Latin epic, as well as a book on Lucretius, student commentaries on Ovid and Tacitus, and the latest of some sixty articles in peer-reviewed journals.
