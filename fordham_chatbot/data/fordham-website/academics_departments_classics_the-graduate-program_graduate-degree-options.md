**Thank you for your interest in the graduate program in Classics. The graduate program has been placed on hiatus and will not be accepting applications at this time.**

College-level proficiency in Greek and Latin is expected for admission to the M.A. and Ph.D. programs. Students applying for the Ph.D. in medieval Latin need not have college-level proficiency in ancient Greek.
