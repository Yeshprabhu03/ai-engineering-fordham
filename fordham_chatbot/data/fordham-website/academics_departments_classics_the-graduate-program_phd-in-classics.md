# Ph.D. in Classics

**Thank you for your interest in the Ph.D. in Classics. The program has been placed on hiatus and will not be accepting applications at this time.**

The study of the Greco-Roman classics offers a rich perspective on western literature, art and architecture, philosophy, and the history of religious thought and practice. By pursuing your Ph.D. studies with us, you’ll join a vibrant community that’s as passionate about classics as you are, and with all of the resources that New York City has to offer.

Integral to our doctoral program is a deep understanding of the history and practice of new and creative research in the field. We also emphasize intensive pedagogical training, and most doctoral students will have the opportunity to teach both language classes and topical courses on the classics in translation (e.g. history, literature, film, and reception studies). The combination of research and teaching skills you acquire will put you in the position to succeed at all academic levels. These skills are also readily transferable beyond the academy, as there is a long tradition of our Classics Ph.D.s thriving in many fields and careers. In fact, thanks to a prestigious grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, Fordham Classics is at the forefront of a movement to cultivate a new “Living Humanities” Ph.D. model.
