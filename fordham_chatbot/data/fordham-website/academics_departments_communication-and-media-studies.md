Just as digitalization and other forms of technological innovation yield a media environment that is constantly changing and evolving, sometimes in revolutionary ways, our diverse program keeps current to the most recent developments in theory and practice while staying true to its mission of emphasizing ethics and social engagement.

The Department of Communication and Media Studies offers four undergraduate programs of study at Rose Hill and Lincoln Center:
