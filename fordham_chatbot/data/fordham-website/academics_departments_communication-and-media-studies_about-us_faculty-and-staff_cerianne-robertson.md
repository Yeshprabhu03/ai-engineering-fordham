Cerianne Robertson researches how power is formed, networked, wielded, and challenged in contests over cities’ futures. Her community-engaged research explores both a) the dominant discourses, imaginaries, and storytelling practices about space, place, race, and class, and how they structure the development of our cities; and b) the opportunities for alternative discourses, imaginaries, and storytelling practices


that create spaces and momentum for more just political possibilities and futures.Cerianne's current work centers on spectacular urban development projects like stadiums and sports mega-events like the Olympics, as well as everyday struggles for survival and dignity in stadium borderlands.
