Prof. Baldwin-Philippi teaches about and researches civic media and political communication, and is interested in how citizens’ engagement with new technologies can restructure forms of political participation and ideas about citizenship. She has approached this area of study from a variety of political contexts, from political campaigns’ use of social media, to games designed to increase participation, to the innovation efforts of municipal governments.
