Dr. Schwartz is a media theorist with particular interest in the role of embodiment in communicative praxis. Her first book,

, analyzed the human corpse as the center of cultural assemblages of mourning, martyrdom, nationalism and celebrity. Her current work in progress proposes a media theory that centers mourning for our enforced and everyday complicity in global capitalism, particularly within the bourgeois home. She brings a more public-facing voice to her nerdcore theory slinging in her Substack newsletter,*Dead Matter*[MOGPROFFERY](https://margaretschwartz.substack.com), where she works out new ideas and indulges in the occasional bout of GenX nostalgia. -
