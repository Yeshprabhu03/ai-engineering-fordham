Dr Mathias Klang is fascinated by the ways in which emerging media impacts all aspects of society, in particular how our use of digital technology changes the ways in which our individual and civil rights (mainly speech, privacy, identity) are both expanded and limited by technology. His current research has two broad areas: The first area explores acts of digital activism in a wider context of civil disobedience, and the second looks at the ways in which our devices intentionally and unintentionally monitor and control our behavior.
