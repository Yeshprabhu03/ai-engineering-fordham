Dr. Rosen is an interdisciplinary social scientist interested in how we engage with information about hazards and disasters. With a background in meteorology and mass communication, she was drawn to study how we communicate about the risks associated with phenomena we encounter everyday. Her research examines science communication around environmental topics such as extreme weather and air quality.

Research Interests: Quantitative and Qualitative Methodologies, Visual Communication, Risk Communication, Science Communication, Environmental Science, Public Health
