# Communication and Media Studies Department Diversity and Inclusion

The Communication and Media Studies Department is committed to sustaining a diverse and inclusive environment through education and scholarship, community engagement, and partnerships across the university that empower our students. We affirm that diversity in race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, ability, religion, and cultural identity enriches our work, our research, and our community. Our curriculum emphasizes ethics and social engagement in the study of media, technology, and communication, and a central learning objective for students in our majors is to grasp the diversity, inclusion, and social justice dimensions of communication and media studies. We honor the accessibility needs of students and faculty and work to create inclusive environments in the classroom and in our broader community.

We also embrace Fordham’s commitment to academic freedom, affirming the university's statute that states, “An essential condition of education is the free and unhampered discovery and communication of the truth.” Our classes encourage critical inquiry, respectful discussion, and active engagement with a wide range of issues animating contemporary public life.
