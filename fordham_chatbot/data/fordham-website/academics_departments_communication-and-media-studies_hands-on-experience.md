# Hands-on Media Experience Opportunities

Media and mass communication is at the heart of what we do as a department. Below is a list of some of the opportunities you will find here at Fordham University to work in journalism, film/tv, and publishing.

-
[WFUV](http://www.wfuv.org/)is Fordham's award-winning radio station and public media service, located in the basement of Keating Hall. An affiliate of National Public Radio, it is known nationwide for having some of the best adult alternative music anywhere. But it also has vibrant operations in both news and sports. The station is professionally run, but Fordham students play a major role. In the news department, students anchor broadcasts, do long-term reporting, and also get out and cover breaking city news. In the sports department, students call games and produce Fordham's renown sports interview show, One on One. If you watch professional sports in New York, there's a good chance that the person calling the game started his or her career in the WFUV sports department... from the Yankees' Michael Kay, to the NBA's Mike Breen, to ESPN's Tony Reali. The station has its own training programs, and they're fantastic.You can contact Robin Shannon for news at

The Ram, Rose Hill's weekly paper, has been Fordham's newspaper of record for over 100 years, and has spawned numerous prize-winning professional journalists. The newspaper is completely written, edited, and produced by Fordham students. Students who work on Fordham's student newspaper are so close-knit that they call themselves "the Ramily," and they warmly welcome new students to get involved. The Ram seeks students to report, write, edit, shoot photos and video, and do layout and illustrations. Sections include news, opinion, culture and sports. Planing meetings are held on Sunday nights, and production is done on Monday and Tuesday nights during the semester. You can see their online version at

It is Lincoln Center’s fourth paper. The first was “The Curved Horn” that was brought over from Rose Hill when the Lincoln Center Campus was built in 1968. Two other papers, “The Review” and “Evex” were started up. By 1981, all three papers had folded and the school was ready for a voice for students and “The Observer” was born.
