# Digital Technologies and Emerging Media (DTEM) Major

The Digital Technologies and Emerging Media (DTEM) major takes a critical approach to the internet and participatory technologies. It draws from a broad tradition of communication and media studies research; social science disciplines including anthropology, psychology, sociology, and political science; and the humanities and fine arts.

The major is designed to encourage greater understanding, critical thinking, and analysis of emerging technologies such as the web, social media, mobile apps, video games, wearables, and the like, while also offering a number of production and writing classes. Students wishing to pursue engineering or digital production should augment the major with classes in computer science, visual arts, journalism, and new media and digital design.
