# Film and Television Major

The film and television major takes a critical and practical approach to the study of media in their shared and distinctive artistic and industrial elements. It draws from a broad tradition of historical, theoretical, and creative practices to best prepare students with the skills they need in the rapidly evolving media landscape.

Fordham’s location in New York City and Jesuit mission makes the University uniquely positioned to offer students cultural and career opportunities in film and television as well as a curriculum that trains them in ethical approaches to media studies and practice.

The major offers a concentration in either film or television, with courses designed uniquely for each concentration and with courses that bridge both tracks. It also offers flexibility for those students wishing to focus on film and/or television writing and production, and those wishing to concentrate on critical, historical, and theoretical concerns.
