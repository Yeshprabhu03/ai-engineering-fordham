# Comparative Literature Program Awards

The Comparative Literature Program awards three annual prizes: the **Katie Fraser Prize for Excellence in Comparative Literature** for a thesis written by a Comparative Literature major, **the Literary Studies Prize for Work in Comparative Literature** for a thesis written by a Comparative Literature minor, and the **Distinguished Mentor Award** for a faculty member who has made a significant contribution to support student thesis work. Not all prizes are awarded in all years.

The **Katie Fraser Prize** is named after Katie Fraser, a 1989 graduate of Fordham College at Lincoln Center. She was an outstanding student in the Comparative Literature program. She was working toward a doctorate in Comparative Literature when she passed away in October 1993. This award is made in her honor.
