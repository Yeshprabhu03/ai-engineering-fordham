# Comparative Literature Bricolage Journal

*Bricolage* is a student-run journal of Comparative Literature that publishes both critical and creative writing in multiple languages – the only Fordham University journal to do so. It also publishes photography and art. Members of the editorial board have control over both the structure and the content of the journal.

Students interested in joining the editorial staff should email [the Comp Lit Program Directors](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/departments/comparative-literature/contact-us/).
