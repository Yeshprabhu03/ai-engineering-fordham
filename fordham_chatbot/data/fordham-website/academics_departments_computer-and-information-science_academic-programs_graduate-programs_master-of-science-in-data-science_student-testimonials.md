For a student like me with no relevant background, it was the M.S. in Data Science program that helped me get on the path to becoming a data scientist. During my two years at Fordham, my data science background was enriched through many helpful hands-on course projects and in-depth research opportunities with professors in different fields. I also had the opportunity to publish, which allowed me to learn a lot about cutting-edge technologies. Further, the program's close ties to industry have allowed me to intern at several big tech companies while in school and secure offers as a data scientist from Amazon, Tiktok and other companies after graduation.

**Yuran Pan, MSDA '19 **Business Intelligence Engineer

Amazon

“Coming from a social science background, I was worried about getting overwhelmed by the field of data science. The M.S. in Data Science program at Fordham made it a smooth transition for me as the courses were interesting to follow and enabled one-on-one attention with small class sizes. Overall, the course selections were comprehensive and well-structured; I was able to patch up my knowledge gaps before moving on to explore data analytics, data engineering, machine learning and deep learning topics. I particularly enjoyed class projects where we used real-world datasets to perform analysis and make predictions. I learned to process large raw datasets which prepared me well to take on projects with minimal guidance during my internship at Vacasa. I’m so thankful that I got a full-time placement at Amazon and recommend this program to anyone who is considering switching into the data science field.”

**Youfei Zhang, MSDA '19**

P&C Analytics Solutions Manager

Swiss Re

“The Data Science master’s program at Fordham helped me build a well-rounded knowledge structure in Data Science, from both an application and theoretical perspective. Coming from a non-computer science background, I was looking for an analytics program that went beyond the applied 'machine learning' and could also help me to establish a solid foundation in computer science, and that's how I discovered the M.S. in Data Science program at Fordham. The core curriculum touches upon the three cornerstones of data science: coding, machine learning, and algorithm design. Further, the electives give students the flexibility to tailor for advanced study in the areas such as big data, cybersecurity, and behavioral informatics. The internship and capstone opportunities are valuable for international students like myself to gain hands-on experiences in industry or academia. The Data Science program sits under the Department of Computer and Information Science and the adjunction also provides the opportunity to register for computer science courses such as Software Engineer and Computer Networks, which are essential knowledge for a career in Data Engineer.”

***The M.S. in Data Science (MSDS) program was named M.S. in Data Analytics (MSDA) prior to January 2020.**
