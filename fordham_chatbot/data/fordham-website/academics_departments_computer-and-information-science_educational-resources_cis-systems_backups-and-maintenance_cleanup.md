# Cleanup

In an effort to conserve disk space, a cleanup program named `skulker`

is run each week on `erdos`

to delete old files deemed to be junk. If users would always clean up after themselves, we wouldn't need to run `skulker`

, but experience has shown that it is necessary.

`Skulker`

looks through all the files in the user home directory areas, seeking out and deleting those that meet its criteria for junk and that have not been used within a given time, currently set as 90 days.
