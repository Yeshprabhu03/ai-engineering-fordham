# Accessing Unix mail from a Smartphone

You can configure your smartphone to read your Unix mail as follows: specify the incoming mail server `storm.cis.fordham.edu`

or `dsm.dsm.fordham.edu`

, port 993. Provide your Unix username and password. Define the type of service as IMAP, with password authentication. You must specify to use SSL. (This may be located under advanced settings.)

Our servers are not configured to serve as relays for outgoing mail. To send outgoing mail, you can use your Fordham IT account. Specify the outgoing mail server as `smtp.gmail.com`

, port 25. Specify that to you *will* be using SSL. For the user name, provide your full Fordham email address (not just the user ID). For the password, use your Fordham account password.
