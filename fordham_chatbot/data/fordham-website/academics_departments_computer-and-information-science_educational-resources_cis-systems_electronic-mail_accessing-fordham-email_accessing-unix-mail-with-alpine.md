# Accessing Unix mail with Alpine

[ alpine](https://linux.die.net/man/1/alpine) is a very user-friendly text-based menu-driven mail handler, so it can be used in a telnet or ssh session. Simply start alpine from the shell prompt, and follow the instructions in the menus.

[ alpine](https://linux.die.net/man/1/alpine) is also compatible with SquirrelMail, described in

[the next section](/academics/departments/computer-and-information-science/educational-resources/cis-systems/electronic-mail/accessing-fordham-email/accessing-unix-mail-via-a-web-interface/), so you can use alpine when your only connection is text-based, and SquirrelMail when you have web access.
