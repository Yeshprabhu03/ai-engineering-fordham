# Direct Linux Login

The workstation computers in the JMH 302 and LL 612 computer labs run Fedora Linux.

The computers in LL 612 use Network Information Service (NIS) for account management, so your `erdos`

account is valid on them. Your `erdos`

home directory is shared to them via Network File System (NFS). Therefore you may use these machines interchangeably.
