# Internet Connections

The Department's servers are connected to Internet, a worldwide network. From them, you can log in remotely onto any computer on the Internet on which you have an account, as well as transfer files to or from such a computer, including other Fordham hosts that are connected to the Internet. You can also connect from other computers to the local machines. To refer to Departmental hosts from elsewhere, the local domain, `cis.fordham.edu`

or `dsm.fordham.edu`

, must be included. For instance, `erdos's`

full name is `erdos.dsm.fordham.edu`
