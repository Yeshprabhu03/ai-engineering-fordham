# Alternative Methods of File Transfer

If you do not have a file transfer client or for some reason it is temporarily not working, there are a few other options for achieving the goal of transferring a file from your home machine to the Unix host.

One solution is to e-mail yourself the file, using your Unix mail address. For this method to work, you must not have forwarding set up from your Unix account. You can then use alpine to read your mail and save it to a file.

You can put the file onto a USB memory stick and bring it to the computer lab. There you can log in to your Linux account, insert the memory stick into the computer, and transfer the file to the appropriate place in your home directory.
