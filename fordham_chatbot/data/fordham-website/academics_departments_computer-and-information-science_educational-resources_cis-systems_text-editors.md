# Text Editors

The following text editors are available for use:

`emacs`

--Customizable full-screen editor.

`vi`

--Standard Unix full-screen editor.

`pico`

--User-friendly simple text editor.

`gedit`

--Powerful and user-friendly editor for X-windows.

Of these, `emacs`

and `vi`

are of interest for most people. Use `pico`

if your needs are simple and you won't be doing much editing. Use `gedit`

if you want a more capable editor and will only be working in X-windows mode.

The following are traditional old-fashioned Unix text editors, which are listed here mainly so you know what to avoid, except for `sed`

, which is useful as a filter in shell commands and scripts.

`ed`

--Standard Unix line-oriented editor.

`ex`

--Full-screen editor, includes `vi`

.

`sed`

--Standard Unix stream editor.
