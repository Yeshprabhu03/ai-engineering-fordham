# Emacs for Windows and Mac

If you want to use Emacs on your home PC running Microsoft Windows, you can [download it for free](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html). Simply fetch the file with a name like `emacs-25.1-2-i686-w64-mingw32.zip `

(the version number may change). Unzip the zip file preserving the directory structure, and run `bin\runemacs.exe`

. Alternatively, create a desktop shortcut to `bin\runemacs.exe`

, and start Emacs by double-clicking on that shortcut's icon.

Macintosh users may want to explore `Aquamacs Emacs`

, which is Mac version of emacs that feels and behaves mostly like a ''standard'' Macintosh application. In addition, there's a version emacs that is included with Mac OS X. This version is not aware of X-windows; however, the version that is available via `Fink`

*is* X-windows aware.
