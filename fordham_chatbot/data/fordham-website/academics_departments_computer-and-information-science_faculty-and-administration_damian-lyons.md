Damian M. Lyons is a Professor of Computer Science at Fordham University. He has degrees in

[Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.cs.tcd.ie/)from[Trinity College, University of Dublin](http://www.tcd.ie/)in Ireland, and he earned his PhD in[Computer Science](http://www.cs.umass.edu/)from the[University of Massachusetts at Amherst](http://www.cs.umass.edu/)for research on formal models of computation for sensory-based robotics.He worked for many years as a researcher in the US branch of the

[corporate research laboratories](http://www.research.philips.com/)of[Philips Electronics](http://www.philips.com/), the European Semiconductor and Consumer Electronics giant. His work there included research in representing and analyzing robot action plans, he served as project leader for Philips' research activities in Automated Video Surveillance, and later as Department head for the Video and Display Processing research department. Dr. Lyons is the founding Director of Fordham’s Computer Vision and Robotics Lab and was founding Director of the Fordham CS doctoral program.Dr. Lyons has served on numerous conference program committees, has published over 100 technical papers in conferences, journals and books, and has authored 18 patents. Dr. Lyons is a senior member of IEEE and a member of ACM.

My research interests are in Robotics and Computer Vision, in particular for systems that operate autonomously in dynamic and unstructured environments. Most recently I have worked on wide area visual navigation for heterogeneous robot teams. I am especially interested in how robotics can support farms, diversify agriculture, and enable competition with large agribusinesses. Currently I focus on a specific but significant requirement for this kind of application: the flexible and robust wide-area navigation required to handle the navigation of robots for livestock management despite the changing visual appearance of the landscape due to weather and growth of vegetation and crops.
