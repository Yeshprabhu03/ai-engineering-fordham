Eugenio Grippo received his M.S. and Ph.D. in EE (Electrical Engineering) from


University of Southern California (USC), where he also conducted Postdoctoral studies

in Computer Science (CS); he received his “Automation and Industrial Control

Engineer” degree from Universidad Nacional de Quilmes (UNQUI, Buenos Aires,

Argentina).

Eugenio worked in the ANRG (Autonomous Network Research Group)

center at USC where he conducted research in machine learning, distributed

computing, IoT and cybersecurity. After that, he worked in the ICAROS LAB

(Interactive and Collaborative Autonomous Robotics Lab) at USC where he

contributed to the development of the UCLA buoyancy assisted legged

lightweight unit robot (UCLA BALLU).

Eugenio also worked as a Visiting Assistant Professor of Computer

Science at Occidental College, Los Angeles, USA; and as an Adjunct Professor

in Data Science at Pacific States University, Los Angeles, USA. -
Eugenio’s research is at the nexus of mathematical modeling, network


science, and applied machine learning, addressing critical challenges in power

systems, cybersecurity, decentralized finance, and communications. He has

developed (along with colleagues) innovative applications of differential

geometry in power grid modeling and provided new insights into congestion

detection and load balancing, with implications extending to various types of

networks, including social and data networks. Looking ahead his research

endeavors to focus on designing low-latency, adaptive network synthesis

methods suitable for adversarial environments, and advancing curvature-based

analysis techniques for directed graphs to enhance the modeling of complex

communication and social networks. Through these interdisciplinary efforts he

aims to contribute robust, scalable solutions to some of the most pressing

technological challenges of our time.**RESEARCH INTEREST**
