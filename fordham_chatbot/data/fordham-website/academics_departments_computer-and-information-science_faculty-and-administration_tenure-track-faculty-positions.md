### Description

The Department of Computer and Information Science (CIS) at Fordham University invites applications for the Kim B. and Stephen E. Bepler Chair in the Natural and Applied Sciences. This is one of five Bepler Chairs at Fordham, made possible through generous endowments from Kim and Steve Bepler, to recognize scientists of exceptional scholarly impact.

This newly endowed Chair is a focal point of the University’s strategy to provide thought leadership for Fordham's efforts to develop innovative technologies and intelligence that advance the common good. The successful candidate will be able to cultivate, build, and inspire institutional practices in research and teaching connected to AI applications across the University, the discipline, and broader industries. The Bepler Chair will facilitate inter- and trans-disciplinary research that advances solutions to some of society’s greatest scientific and technological challenges—and doing so in a way that promotes ethical practices that ultimately benefit individuals, communities, and the health of our planet. Ongoing research in the department encompasses generative AI, cybersecurity, quantum computing, robotics, computational finance, collaborations with biology and neuroscience, as well as partnerships with IBM, Columbia, NYU, and the Bronx Zoo/Botanical Gardens.

The Bepler Chair in the Natural and Applied Sciences includes a tenured appointment in the CIS Department at an appropriate rank and is accompanied by a reduced teaching load and a research fund supported by the endowment. The Chair holder will be a distinguished researcher and a gifted teacher, promoting integrated interdisciplinary approaches across the natural and applied sciences, as well as related fields.

The initial appointment to the Chair is for five years, with the possibility of renewal contingent upon continued scholarly contributions consistent with the terms of the Chair.

The expected salary range for the rank of Associate Professor is $120,000 to $160,000, and for Professor is $160,000 to $200,000.
