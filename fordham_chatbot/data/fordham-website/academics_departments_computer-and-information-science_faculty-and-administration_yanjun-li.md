Dr. Yanjun Li is an assistant professor of Computer and Information Science at Fordham University. Dr. Li earned her MS and PhD degree in Computer Science from

[Wright State University](http://www.wright.edu/). Dr. Li has published journal and conference papers in the areas of text mining, data mining, artificial intelligence, and parallel computing. She is considered an expert in the area of data mining and information retrieval. -
My primary research area is data mining and knowledge discovery. Data mining (sometimes called data or knowledge discovery) is the process of analyzing data from different perspectives and summarizing it into implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful information. Technically, data mining is the process of finding correlations or patterns among dozens of fields in large relational databases.

I am specially interested in studying text mining algorithms, applying parallel and distributed computing techniques in data mining area. My recent work has focused on text clustering, text classification, and ontology building. I have also been doing research on parallel text mining algorithms.
