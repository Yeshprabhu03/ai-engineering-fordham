# Ailey/Fordham BFA in Dance Scholars

## Denise Jefferson Memorial Scholarship

In 1998 an entirely new form of higher education in dance was born with the opening of the Ailey/Fordham program, with equal emphasis on professional dance training and a rigorous liberal arts education. Denise Jefferson was director of The Ailey School as the program was conceived and inaugurated in 1998 until her death in 2010. In 2012 an artistic merit scholarship was named in Denise's honor and funded by the students' performance in this annual concert and awarded to a junior and senior student each year. It is a fitting memorial for Denise who gave so much to a program and its graduates who are dancing across the country and across the world.
