# Design and Technology

*New Media and Digital Design (NMDD) *is changing to the *Design and Technology* (DEST) program. While NMDD will remain available for current students through 2032, new students entering in Fall 2026 can join the reimagined Design and Technology (DEST) program.

**Fordham's undergraduate program in Design and Technology is an interdisciplinary program that connects creative expression, design, justice, and technology to support the next generation of designers, artists, and technologists. **The program combines the forces of *Communication and Media Studies*, *Computer and Information Science*, *Visual Arts*, and the *Gabelli School of Business*.

In this program, a designer is understood as a visionary who integrates aesthetics, functionality, and ethical considerations to innovate and solve problems. Design itself refers to the intentional process of synthesizing ideas, needs, and constraints into experiences that positively affect individuals and communities. Through hands-on coursework, collaboration with practitioners, and engagement with scholars, students will learn to make, use, and reimagine design and technology in ways that impact society and communities in meaningful ways.
