# Design and Technology Careers & Internships

**Our NMDD students and graduates follow a very wide range of career paths.**

Roughly based on the three concentrations: Commerce students often go into digital marketing, branding, PR; Art, Text, Design students often go into web design or UX design; Information students often go into digital content production, for companies across the spectrum of industries or for NGOs/non-profits. But the major and your course selection is so customizable that you can really choose your own path, therefore you can shape it for the kinds of jobs you are interested in getting.
