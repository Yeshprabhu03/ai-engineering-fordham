# NMDD Program Info

**The New Media and Digital Design (NMDD) major and minor are transitioning to a new program, Design & Technology (DEST), beginning in Fall 2026.**

If you are a current NMDD student, your degree remains fully supported and accredited. This page explains what the transition means for you.

-
**Core Courses:**NMDD required*Explorations in New Media and Digital Design*, an internship seminar, a computer science core course, and a capstone. DEST requires*Fundamentals of Media Design*,*Fundamentals of Interaction Design*, and a capstone studio.**Unlike NMDD, DEST does not require an internship or computer science core course,***however*there are options to count internships for credit, and the "making" competency has a large amount of computer science courses to choose from.**Comparing the Majors***New Media and Digital Design (NMDD)*

**What this means if you switch:**- Some of your NMDD courses may “map” directly into DEST competencies.
- Your adviser will work with you to evaluate your credits and see how far along you are in NMDD before deciding if switching makes sense.


-
Students can declare NMDD through

**Summer 2026**. After that, only the new**Design & Technology (DEST)**program will be available to new students.NMDD will officially run until its

**to-be-terminated (TBT) date of August 31, 2032**, giving all students time to complete their degrees. -
Most courses will continue as usual but may carry both NMDD and DEST codes.

- For example,
*NMDD 4600 (Capstone)*will also appear under DEST codes. - Courses are
**not taught separately**, you will be in the same classroom with both NMDD and DEST students, as we transition.

- For example,
-
The update reflects how the field — and Fordham’s program — has evolved.

**Broader scope:**The NMDD program was originally built around concentrations (Art & Text, Information, Commerce). The new DEST program is organized around*competencies*that better match today’s design and technology careers:- Social Responsibility (design as social)
- Business Strategy (design as product)
- Design Methods (design as process)
- Making (design as material)
**Clearer identity:***Design & Technology*more accurately describes what students study and the skills they graduate with, making the program stronger for advising, internships, and job placement.**More flexibility:**The competency model lets you build your own pathway (UX designer, digital artist, product designer, activist designer, etc.) rather than being locked into one concentration.**Future-facing:**The name and curriculum align with industry expectations and graduate programs, ensuring Fordham students stay competitive.


-
Yes. DEST courses may count toward NMDD degree requirements, and your adviser will confirm which ones apply.

-
No. The department has designed the transition so NMDD and DEST students share the same classes when possible. Advisers will guide you to make sure you stay on track.

-
**New Students:**Students entering Fordham in**Fall 2026 or later**can directly join DEST.**Current NMDD students:**If you declared NMDD before Summer 2026 but want to explore DEST, you’ll need to speak with your adviser. In some cases, you may be able to change your major officially; in others, you can remain NMDD and still take DEST-coded courses as electives.
