Edmond Blount serves as an advisor to financial regulators and trade associations on capital markets issues, as well as a consultant to law firms on securities litigation matters. Blount has worked in the securities markets for 35 years, first with Citibank,Bankers Trust, ASTEC Consulting, Advanced Securities Consulting, and the Center for Study of Financial Market Evolution (CSFME).

He is now Executive Director of the Center for Study of Financial Market Evolution (CSFME), a non-profit research group he founded in 2006, and President of Advanced Securities Consulting, LLC. Both firms are based in Washington, D.C. When, in 2007, Ed sold ASTEC Consulting Group to a Fortune 500 data systems vendor, the firm's research cooperatives and online risk/pricing systems were serving 500 institutional investors with counterparty exposures of US $3 trillion. Part of the sale proceeds were deposited in a foundation to fund the Center's activities.

Blount’s paper on the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, “Liability Dynamics: A New Framework for Counterparty Risk Management?”, was published in the March, 2009 issue of the Risk Management Association (RMA) Journal. In April, 2007, he presented "The Impact of Short Sales and Securities Lending on Capital Market Portfolios: 1990 through 2006," at the IMF-World Bank conference in Moscow, Russia. In 2006, Blount co-authored "Managing Liquidity Risks in Cash-based Lending Programs," in Securities Finance: Lending and Repurchase Agreements, edited by Frank Fabozzi and published by Wiley.

Since 1980, Ed Blount has been a writer and contributing editor of the ABA Banking Journal of the American Bankers Association. In many published articles, Blount has conducted in-depth interviews with senior officials of the SEC, Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Bank for International Settlements, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, European Commission, European Central Bank and the Swiss Private Bankers Association.

In 1992, one of Blount’s prior firms was the first investment consultancy to benchmark securities lending programs, by forming a research cooperative that grew to more than 250 institutional investors, 30 bank agents and 50 broker-dealers. Blount introduced Lending Pit as the first pricing service for securities loans on the Internet in 2004. By 2007, when Blount sold the business to a Fortune 500 company, traders were receiving daily borrowing rates on over 90,000 securities.

A former U.S. Marine Captain, Blount has degrees from Fordham University, Pepperdine University and New York University. He is a member of the Executive Committee of Fordham’s President’s Council. A frequent speaker at industry conferences worldwide, Blount serves on the Advisory Board of the Mutual Fund Directors Forum and the Institutional Investor Task Force of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. He was inducted into Asset International’s Securities Services Hall of Fame in June 2009.
