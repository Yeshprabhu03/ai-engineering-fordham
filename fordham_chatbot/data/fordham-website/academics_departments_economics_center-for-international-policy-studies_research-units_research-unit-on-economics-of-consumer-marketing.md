Director:
[Dr. Kurt Jetta](/academics/departments/economics/faculty/kurt-jetta/)

The Research Unit for the Economics of Consumer Marketing facilitates research on the integration of economic theory into the marketing discipline. By working with manufacturers, consumer research suppliers and academics the center brings together multiple perspectives on how the theoretical aspects of pricing theory, utility theory, and market structure can be incorporated into improving the research, science and practice of consumer marketing. Moreover, the center aims to understand corporate and government marketing around the globe and its use as an economic policy tool to correctly communicate policy oriented actions.
