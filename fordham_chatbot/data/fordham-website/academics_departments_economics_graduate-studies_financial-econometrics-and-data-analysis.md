**Please note:** The Advanced Certificate in Financial Econometrics and Data Analysis is **available only to current Fordham University students**.

Today’s financial world requires analysts who know how to extract critical business knowledge from vast amounts of data. Our graduate-level certificate in financial econometrics and data analysis is designed to meet that growing need.

This interdisciplinary program, which combines the strengths of our [computer and information science department](/academics/departments/computer-and-information-science/academic-programs/graduate-programs/) and [economics department](/academics/departments/economics/graduate-studies/), will provide you with state-of-the-art rigorous training in quantitative analysis.

### Topics covered include:

- Econometric techniques, starting with least squares estimation and finishing with forecasting and modeling of financial variables
- Statistical diagnostics and corrections for data using an industry standard data analysis tool
- Data mining techniques for dealing with large data sets
- Exploratory data analysis systems to build hands-on experience

### Program Basics

- Cumulative GPA of 3.0 (B) is required to complete certificate
- Courses can be counted toward graduate degrees in economics (
