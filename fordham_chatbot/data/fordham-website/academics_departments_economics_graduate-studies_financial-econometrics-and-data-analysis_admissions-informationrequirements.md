# Advanced Certificate in Financial Econometrics and Data Analysis Admissions Information

**Please note:** The Advanced Certificate in Financial Econometrics and Data Analysis is **available only to current Fordham University students**.

Completed applications for the Advanced Certificate in Financial Econometrics and Data Analysis will include each of the following items:

**Academic transcripts**

To be eligible for admission, applicants must hold a four-year bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university in the United States, or the equivalent of a U.S. bachelor’s degree from a recognized institution abroad (for some countries, this may be a three-year degree from a [member institution](https://ehea.info/page-full_members) within the [Bologna Process](http://www.ehea.info/)). If you are applying during your final (senior) year of undergraduate study, you may submit your application with an unofficial transcript that includes all completed coursework to date.

When you apply, you are required to upload unofficial transcripts from the institution where you earned or will earn your bachelor’s degree, and if applicable, master’s degree, including any institutions where transfer credits counted toward either an undergraduate or graduate-level degree.

**International students: **Transcripts from previously attended post-secondary institutions must be submitted in English or with a certified English translation. For academic transcripts from institutions outside the United States, applicants are encouraged to obtain a course-by-course credential evaluation. See [GSAS International Students](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/admissions/international-students/) for more information.

If you are offered admission to a GSAS program and accept the offer, you must submit official final transcripts with final grades and the title of the degree conferred. Official transcripts must be received by Fordham GSAS Admissions **before the first day of classes**.
