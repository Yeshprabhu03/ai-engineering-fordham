# Honors in Economics

## Program Requirements

Program requirements are here.

To be eligible for Honors in Economics, a student must:

- Maintain an overall GPA of at least 3.25 and 3.5 or better in economics courses (must be maintained through completion of the final two semesters (i.e. the senior year));
- Complete both
[ECON 3885. Introductory Econometrics](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/undergraduate/economics/economics-major/?_ga=2.180293860.1932742382.1614607742-2050986880.1610374112#requirementstext)and[ECON 3154 Mathematics for Economists](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/undergraduate/economics/#coursestext)or approved substitutes by the end of the penultimate semester (usually, the fall semester of the senior year); - Apply for honors in the major by contacting their Associate Chair during the beginning of their penultimate semester (usually, the fall semester of senior year);
- Write an honors thesis in the form of a research paper, following the requirements outlined below.

### Research Paper

To complete the research paper requirement, a student must:

- Select an economics faculty mentor to work with throughout the final two semesters;
- Have the mentor approve a topic no later than the penultimate semester (usually the fall semester of senior year);
- Enroll for
[ECON 4998 Honors Seminar in Economics](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/undergraduate/economics/#coursestext)for one credit in the final semester on a pass/fail basis; - Submit to the mentor an outline (or comparable preliminary plan) within the first month of the final semester.
- Have the paper passed by the mentor and two faculty readers.
- Submit the thesis to readers by the twelfth week of their final semester, and the final draft no later than the last day of classes.

The student does not have to defend the these orally, but may be asked to do revisions. When the thesis is accepted, the student will receive one credit for the Honors Seminar and graduation "with honors in economics" will appear on the student's transcript.


Economics majors enrolled in an [Honors Program](/academics/undergraduate-education/honors-programs/) who write a thesis in economics as part of that program can apply to also be awarded honors in economics if (1) they meet the GPA and coursework requirements, and (2) the student's thesis mentor is a member of the economics faculty. Honors program students do not have to enroll in ECON 4998.


Economics majors with more than one major may earn honors in economics and in their other major, but not for the same thesis. Students in related majors (for example, interdisciplinary mathematics & economics and international political economy) may apply for honors in their major, whereas honors in economics is reserved for economics majors.
