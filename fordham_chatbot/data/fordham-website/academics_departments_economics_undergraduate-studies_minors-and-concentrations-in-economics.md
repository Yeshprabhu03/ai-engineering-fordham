# Minors and Concentrations in Economics

Many students in Fordham College and in the Gabelli School of Business choose to complement their major with a [minor in Economics](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/undergraduate/economics/minor/) or a
[concentration in Business Economics](/academics/departments/economics/undergraduate-studies/minors-and-concentrations-in-economics/business-economics-concentration/) (GSB students only).
