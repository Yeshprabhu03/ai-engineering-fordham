# Recommended Courses in Business Economics

Managerial Economics provides a micro theory framework for business decisions and management

- Money and Banking studies the institutions and operations of our commercial banking system for students to have a thorough understanding of the banking system, the creation and allocation of money and credit and the role of the Federal Reserve Bank
- Macroeconomic Analysis studies the impact of monetary policy on inflation, unemployment and economic growth, all of which will affect the individual corporation

The primary concentration in business economics requires that you take:

- Macroeconomic Analysis
- Microeconomic Theory
- Two upper level economics courses

These two upper-level courses could be drawn from the following economics department courses focused on finance:

- Financial Markets
- Issues in Financial Markets
- International Finance
- Emerging Financial Markets

Then the secondary concentration in finance requires three courses from GSB that could be selected from:

- Investment and Security Analysis
- Portfolio Management
- Options and Futures
- International Investment

GSB students are allowed to take four liberal arts electives and one business elective. The four liberal arts electives could focus on additional finance courses in economics or on such fundamentals as money and banking.

Notice that with careful planning, a GSB student could take a primary concentration in business economics and then use free liberal arts electives to select three more economics courses. This would be equivalent to an economics major from Fordham College. (Economics majors have five economics electives.) One could have the benefits of a pre-professional program (the GSB core) with the strengths of a liberal arts degree in economics.
