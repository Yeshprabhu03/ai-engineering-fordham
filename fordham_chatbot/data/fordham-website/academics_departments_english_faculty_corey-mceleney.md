He received his Ph.D. and M.A. from Brown University and his B.A. from UCLA. His monograph

*Futile Pleasures: Early Modern Literature and the Limits of Utility*(Fordham University Press, 2017), which explores the complex role that pleasure plays in early modern and contemporary debates about the value of literature, received an honorable mention in the MLA Prize for a First Book competition. His essays have appeared in the journals*ELH**,**GLQ**,*and, as well as in collections on*differences*[the New Formalism](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/9781137010490),[Thomas Nashe](https://www.routledge.com/The-Age-of-Thomas-Nashe-Text-Bodies-and-Trespasses-of-Authorship-in-Early/Guy-Bray-Linton/p/book/9781409468059), and[John Milton](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-97049-3). He is currently at work on a new book project tentatively titled*The Art of Overanalyzing*, which examines and critiques the cultural and political implications of the stereotype that professors of literature “overanalyze” texts to death.
