[Crystal Colombini’](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cba8a8a4a7a4a6a9a2a5a28bada4b9afa3aaa6e5aeafbe)s research examines connections between theories of rhetoric and writing and ideas about the economy. Her projects explore how various rhetorical traditions, events, and situations—from public debates about markets, to political deliberation over policies, to the resistant acts of social movements—intersect with the pressures of neoliberal capitalism to push wealth upward, alienate individuals from social collectives, and maintain intersectional inequalities. Her monograph*Constructing the Market*, which explores the public rhetoric of American homeownership, is in process with Penn State University Press. Her articles have appeared in a range of journals including*College English*,*Rhetoric Society Quarterly*,*Advances in the History of Rhetoric*, and*Technical Communication Quarterly*.
