## History of A Book Seminar

The History of A Book Seminar is a running series of lecture/discussions about the various ways that works of criticism come into existence. While our presenters' books will arrive from the press polished and brilliant and free of sweat and tear stains, in this seminar authors take us behind the scenes to reveal the hard work that went into the project at each stage: original conception, dead ends and sustaining developments, selection and use of archival material, right down to the writing habits that worked best.

[Kundiman](http://www.kundiman.org/)

Kundiman is dedicated to the creation, cultivation and promotion of Asian American poetry. The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the English Department are proud to host the Kundiman retreat at Rose Hill. Kundiman fellows report first-time publication in national literary journals, finalist distinction in literary awards and a greater sense of confidence in their pursuit of literary excellence. Since 2004, twenty fellows have published books and they credit Kundiman as being catalytic in their growth as writers.

[The Fordham Romanticism Group](http://www.fordhamromanticism.org/)

The Fordham Romanticism Group was founded by Sarah Zimmerman and John Bugg at Fordham University in 2008 to bring together scholars in the New York City area who work on the literature and culture of the Romantic period. We wish to foster an interdisciplinary conversation on the era's literature, history, and culture within a global framework. With the support of Fordham University, the NYCRG hosts guest speakers, sponsors colloquia, and organizes conference panels in order to forge links between students and scholars in New York City and beyond.
