Heather Dubrow is the author of seven scholarly books, most recently

(Palgrave Pivot) and*Deixis in the Early Modern English Lyric: Unsettling Spatial Anchors Like "Here," "This," "Come"*(Johns Hopkins). Her other publications include two collections of her own poetry,*The Challenges of Orpheus: Lyric Poetry and Early Modern England*(Cherry Grove Collections and Lost and Found Departments (Cornerstone Press ); a co-edited collection of essays; an edition of*Forms and Hollows**As You Like It*; articles on early modern literature, teaching, and policies and challenges in higher education. Building bridges between critical approaches has long been one of her goals, and in particular she engages in what is sometimes termed New Formalism, which traces the interactions between form in its many senses and concerns of recent scholarship, such as material and historical analysis. Among Heather Dubrow's interdisciplinary interests is the relationship between visual and literary arts. She was director of Fordham's Poets Out Loud reading series between 2009 and 2020. Her work in professional organizations has involved membership on the Executive Board of Columbia's Shakespeare seminar and on the Modern Language Association's Executive Council and several of its other committees. Other positions included the presidencies of the John Donne Society and of INSL (International Network for the Study of Lyric). At the conclusion of her term as president of INSL, she accepted the invitation from the incoming president to remain among its officers as an ex-officio vice president for an additional year.
