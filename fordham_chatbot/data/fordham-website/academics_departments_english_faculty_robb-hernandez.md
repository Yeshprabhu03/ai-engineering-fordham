As an American Studies scholar, Robb Hernández’s approach to Latinx literature is interdisciplinary combining literary studies with visual culture, contemporary art history, performance studies, and museum/exhibition research. He is the author of

[Archiving an Epidemic: Art, AIDS, and the Queer Chicanx Avant-Garde](https://nyupress.org/9781479820832/archiving-an-epidemic/)(NYU Press, 2019)*,*which catalogs a queer retelling of the Chicana and Chicano art movement, from its origins in the 1960s, to the AIDS crisis and the destruction it wrought in the 1980s. From remnants, he unveils alternative archival formations in subterranean spaces of queer custodians and collectors to show not what Chicanx art is but what it could have been. In 2017, he co-curatedthe first major exhibition to examine three decades of Latinx and Latin American science fiction artistic practices. The show travelled*Mundos Alternos: Art and Science Fiction in the Americas*,[nationally](https://queensmuseum.org/2018/09/mundos-alternos)and was sponsored by the Getty Foundation’s Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA initiative in 2017.He is also the author of
