Sarah Zimmerman is the author of

*Romanticism, Lyricism, and History*(SUNY 1999) and*T*[he Romantic Literary Lecture in Britain](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-romantic-literary-lecture-in-britain-9780198833147?cc=us&lang=en&)[(Oxford UP 2019)](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-romantic-literary-lecture-in-britain-9780198833147?cc=us&lang=en&). Both projects reflect her interest in reading various genres in relationship to historical audiences, and in the intersection of the period's emphasis on interiority with the vibrancy and informing presence of its reading publics. That work includes essays on the poetry of Charlotte Smith and John Clare, the drama of Percy Bysshe Shelley, and the lectures of Coleridge.
