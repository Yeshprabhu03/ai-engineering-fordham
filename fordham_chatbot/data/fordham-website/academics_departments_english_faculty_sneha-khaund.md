[Sneha Khaund’s](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#eb9880838a9e858fab8d84998f838a86c58e8f9e)research is situated at the intersection of postcolonial studies, comparative literature, translation studies, and narrative theory. Her book project,*Multilingual Assamese: Literature, Identity, and Resistance in the Indo-Bangladesh Borderlands*, shows that contestations over linguistic and national identity in 20thand 21stcentury texts drawn from borderland geographies in South Asia provide new ways to engage with literary form, including genre, mode, and the canon. Her work highlights ways in which contemporary South Asian writing, particularly from Northeast India, negotiates the colonial legacies of English through decolonial articulations of indigenous literary expression and transnational solidarities. Sneha Khaund’s writing has appeared in*South Asian Review*,*Warscapes*,*Asymptote Journal*, and*Scroll.in*and she is a literary translator working across Assamese, Bangla, and English.
