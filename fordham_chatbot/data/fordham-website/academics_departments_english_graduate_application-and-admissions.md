# Application and Admissions

Fordham’s English Department warmly welcomes qualified M.A. and Ph.D. applicants who seek to join a dedicated, vibrant community of scholar-teachers to pursue literary studies at an advanced level. Our M.A. program offers in-depth exploration of literary topics and diverse professionalization opportunities over a nimble two-year program. Our Ph.D. program supports students from year 1 through the dissertation defense and beyond, with flexibly conceived coursework, hands-on mentorship, sustained pedagogical formation, and diversified professional development. We seek to strike a balance between broad historical coverage and research specialization, and we encourage students to explore and expand their intellectual interests over the duration of their studies. Our faculty teaches and mentors widely across literary fields from medieval to contemporary; please see the list of Areas of Interest below for an up-to-date sense of our department’s current research strengths. Apply through [The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences online application](https://gradadmissions.fordham.edu/apply/).

Your writing sample should be an original scholarly essay between fifteen (15) and twenty-five (25) pages, preferably written for an upper-level literature course. Ideally, it should reflect your scholarly interests and intellectual potential. The sample must be written in English and may be uploaded either as a Word or PDF document. Note: applicants who do not have a 15-page sample may submit two shorter samples (for example, 2 papers of 10 pages each would be acceptable).

To be eligible for admission, applicants must hold a four-year bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university in the United States, or the equivalent of a U.S. bachelor’s degree from a recognized institution abroad (for some countries, this may be a three-year degree from a [member institution](https://ehea.info/page-full_members) within the [Bologna Process](http://www.ehea.info/)). If you are applying during your final (senior) year of undergraduate study, you may submit your application with an unofficial transcript that includes all completed coursework to date.

When you apply, you are required to upload unofficial transcripts from the institution where you earned or will earn your bachelor’s degree, and if applicable, master’s degree, including any institutions where transfer credits counted toward either an undergraduate or graduate-level degree.

Additional coursework may also be recommended by the IALC.

Students are permitted to register for two GSAS courses during the academic term in which they are completing any IALC-recommended coursework, which generally occurs during their first semester of study.

Please note: Tuition costs associated with the learning of English as a second language are the responsibility of the student and will not be covered by a GSAS tuition scholarship. GSAS merit-based tuition scholarships are not applicable to the costs of additional coursework recommended by the IALC.
