**ENGL 5135: Paleography (Fridays, 2:30 PM - 5:00 PM)**

[Thomas O'Donnell](/academics/departments/english/faculty/thomas-odonnell/)

This course offers an in-depth introduction to the history of handwriting and book production (“paleography” and “codicology”) in western and central Europe during the years 400 to 1500—a critical period for the creation of the book as we know it. Students will receive training in the handling and interpretation of rare materials from across the whole medieval period. They will learn how to read and transcribe ancient and medieval writing (a set of skills that will transfer to later periods of handwriting); how to determine the place and date of production of a book based on its script, material, or decoration; and how to interpret the manuscript book as a primary source for the study of society, politics, and culture. Trips to special collections and visits from period experts from a range of disciplines are a feature of the course. Specialists of any historical period are welcome.

**ENGL 5266: ****Writing Modern Life: The City (Thursdays, 2:30 PM - 5:00 PM)**

[Lawrence Kramer](/academics/departments/english/faculty/lawrence-kramer/)

**The city in literary tradition originates as an object of satire or a utopian fiction, but beginning in the nineteenth century it evolves into the essential scene of modern life for both good and ill. This course will examine the modern city in literature, especially Paris, London, and New York, plus James Joyce’s Dublin. After an introductory look at premodern instances, the course will examine the making and marring of urban modernity in both poetry and fiction, with asides in music and film. Writers to be read may include William Wordsworth, Charles Baudelaire, Walt Whitman, Edith Wharton, James Weldon Johnson, T. S. Eliot, Federico Garcia Lorca, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and Jean Rhys, among others, together with contemporaneous theorists of modern urban life: Georg Simmel, Walter Benjamin, Henri Lefebre, and Lewis Mumford.**

**ENGL 5543: New Theories in Black Studies (Tuesdays, 5:30 PM - 8:00 PM)**[Sasha Panaram](/academics/departments/english/faculty/sasha-ann-panaram/)

The field of Black Literary and Cultural Studies is flourishing. The past few years have witnessed the production of innovative texts that challenge traditional forms of scholarship and offer new models for writing. In this course, graduate students will read an array of recently published scholarship to determine what new methodologies, genealogies, theoretical, and critical concerns are being raised. Each new monograph that we read will be paired with a foundational field-shaping article in Black Studies and students will be asked to articulate the relationship between the two. Our weekly readings will be supplemented with guest lectures from several of the authors featured on the syllabus as well as a visit to the Schomburg Center. Possible authors include: Jennifer C. Nash, Imani Owens, Julius Fleming, I. Augustus Durham, Mecca Jamilah Sullivan, Marina Magloire, and Tina Post, among others.**CRN 52354**

**ENGL 5600: Special Topics in Rhetorical Theory & Criticism: Rhetoric and Racial Capitalism ****(Mondays, 5:30 PM - 8:00 PM)**

[Catherine Chaput](/academics/departments/english/faculty/catherine-chaput/)

As part of the Graduate Certificate in Rhetoric & Writing, this course uses a rhetorical lens to explore the history of race, gender, sexuality, and other identity categories as they have been invented alongside capitalism. The course is divided into three units. The first unit focuses on a structural critique. We will position the domestication of women, the colonization of land, resources, and people, as well as the trans-Atlantic slave trade as both foundational to capitalism and part of its on-going appropriation of wealth. The second unit investigates the role of the human subject in these processes. Reading theorists with first-hand experiences in the formation of anti-capitalist and/or decolonial states, we will focus on human subject formation and human praxis as sites of oppression as well as possibility. The third unit uses these two forms of critique—the structural and the personal—as foundational to how activist-scholars work to produce more socially just modes of being in the world. It works from the notion of the human subject as both an aesthetic and rhetorical invention.

**ENGL 5746: Instances of Autofiction: Postmodernist Literature in Translation (Thursdays, 5:30 PM - 8:00 PM)**[Daniel Contreras](/academics/departments/english/faculty/daniel-contreras/)

This course will explore the postmodern literary form of autofiction: the curious case of writers writing about "themselves" in a fictional mode. This oxymoronic practice has been both hugely influential and controversial. We will read Nobel prize winners Anne Ernoux and Patrick Modriano, along with literary favorites like Karl Ove Knausgaard, Cesar Aira, Alejandro Zambra, and Sheila Heti. These are all contemporary working writers but when we look into the recent literary past, we find writers such as Norman Mailer, Sylvia Plath, Jorge Luis Borges, James Baldwin, Joan Didion, Hervè Guibert, and Marguerite Duras who all explored what happens when the borders between self and fiction are dissolved. Other writers to consider include: Junot Díaz, Bret Easton Ellis, Rachel Cusk, Ben Lerner, Maggie Nelson, Ocean Vuong. We will ask questions about this slippery form: is it literary narcissism? How is it "creative" and what does it do to the definition of creativity itself? In other words, this is a course about the aesthetics of autofiction.**CRN 52356**~

**ENGL 5849: 19th Century American Literature (Thursdays, 11:30 AM - 2:00 PM)**

[Glenn Hendler](/academics/departments/english/faculty/glenn-hendler/)

An introduction to recent Americanist literary scholarship, comparing and contrasting methodologies that have been brought to bear on three or four important works of U.S. literature published before 1900. Students who register for this class will get some say in which three or four works we will focus on intently.

**ENGL 5029: The Invention of Nature (Fridays, 11:30 - 2:00 PM, at Lincoln Center)**

[Lawrence Kramer](/academics/departments/english/faculty/lawrence-kramer/)

The idea of nature as the autonomous realm of nonhuman life is essentially literary in origin, dating from the early modern era and extending to the present. Nature has come into being in writing, and its elements--animal, vegetable, and mineral--have been brought together under a changing series of rubrics including landscape, wilderness, environment, world, and ecosystem. This course will trace the writing of nature from the early-modern representations of Shakespeare and Montaigne through the pre- and post-Darwinian writings of the nineteenth century (Wordsworth, Poe, Thoreau, and Darwin himself) to modern representations of nature in relation to civilization, race, migration, and ecological crisis (D. H. Lawrence, Elizabeth Bishop, Annie Dillard, Anne Carson). Topics include the aesthetics of nature, the boundaries between the human and nonhuman worlds, and the relationship between the human and the animal.

**ENGL 5189: Birdsong (Wednesdays 11:30 - 2:00 PM at Lincoln Center)**

[Sarah Zimmerman](/academics/departments/english/faculty/sarah-zimmerman/)

The close association of poetry and birdsong is ancient and global. We explore that endlessly renewable connection with a special emphasis on Romantic-era poetry. Writers have long listened closely to birds and been inspired by their singing to experiment with literary innovation. Yet the question of how we listen to birds takes on new urgency in our own era of climate crisis, marked by declining bird populations and extinction. Our wide range of readings features birds alternately sounding warnings as canaries in the coal mine and figuring hope as “the thing with feathers.” We take an interdisciplinary approach to the topic of birds inspired by environmental and sound studies in reading literature and non-fiction prose, including essays and memoirs. We put our learning into practice by birdwatching in local parks, taking advantage of NYC’s location on the Atlantic flyway. Readings include works by Phillis Wheatley Peters, William Wordsworth, Dorothy Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats, and John Clare.

**ENGL 5196: Master Class: Dragons, Daggers, and Dukes: Writing Fantasy/Sci-Fi, Romance/Mystery (Wednesdays 5:30 - 8:00 PM, at Lincoln Center)**Mary Bly

Genre fiction is, by definition, writing that bows to limitation: Conventions shape the parameters of a story. Yet, in excellent genre fiction, the imaginary world is doubly creative despite constraints or conventions. In this class, we’ll tackle bestsellers—pop fiction that engages and enthralls readers. We will study and experiment before setting into a final manuscript in the genre of your choice.

**ENGL 5223: Embodied Research in Medieval Drama (Mondays 2:30 - 5:00 PM)**[Andrew Albin](/academics/departments/english/faculty/andrew-albin/)

What did it feel like to hammer nails into Jesus’s hands or to intone judgements at Doomsday or to dance with the Deadly Sins on an open-air stage in the late Middle Ages? How far can we go in reconstructing, practicing, and sharing medieval performance styles today? What kind of knowledge might the evidence of our own bodies afford us in support of our study of the medieval past? In this course, we will tug at this knot of questions through careful reading, writing, discussion, and experimentation across an uncommon collection of sources, including medieval English playtexts and documents; scholarship on medieval drama and its reenactment; theoretical texts in performance studies, theater-making, and embodied technique; and the witness of our own embodied and reflective experience. Relevant research areas include medieval drama, history of the body, history of experience, history of spirituality, critical temporality studies, non-discursive epistemology, affect studies. Primary source readings will include much of the corpus of surviving Middle English drama supplemented by the Records of Early English Drama project; further readings include Sharon Aronson-Lehavi, Augusto Boal, Rob Boddice, Jerzy Grotowski, Andre Lepecki, Lauren Mancia, Mary Overlie, Rebecca Schneider, Matthew Sergi, Mark Smith, Ben Spatz, and others. Course assignments will center close reading, scholarly research, and academic writing, with options for digital humanities and performance-driven research, undertaken independently or collaboratively. Students may also opt into a parallel laboratory in Mary Overlie’s Six Viewpoints and/or a public performance of medieval drama at the Cloisters Museum in Spring 2026. While helpful, no prior knowledge of Middle English or Latin is expected or required.**CRN 53721**

**ENGL 5252: Exhibiting Latinidad: Curation/Display/Intervention (Fridays, 2:30 - 5:00 PM, at Lincoln Center)**

[Robb Hernández](/academics/departments/english/faculty/robb-hernandez/)

Museums have played critical roles in defining Latinidad for mass publics in the U.S. and abroad. In particular, curators and their exhibits can assume great power over our understandings of authenticity, cultural authority, and the historical “truth” about Latinx cultures. By retracing exhibition histories from classic shows like Cuba-USA and the Decade Show to the Getty’s Pacific Standard Time LA/LA initiative, we will confront the different material, textual, and visual dilemmas provoked by museums. We will also ponder alternative exhibition practices for Latinidad’s representation and remembrance in the future.

**ENGL 5544: Eighteenth-Century Black Thought ****(Thursdays, 2:30 - 5:00 PM)**

[Julie Kim](/academics/departments/english/faculty/julie-chun-kim/)

This course will examine Black writing and art in the eighteenth century, which was defined both by the rise of Atlantic slavery and by resistance to it. How did enslaved individuals describe their experiences of bondage and captivity? How did they respond to rhetorics of racial difference and dehumanization? What alternatives to enslavement, including possibilities of escape, fugitivity, and freedom, did they imagine, and what forms did they deploy to express these alternatives? We will consider these questions to understand the richness and complexity of eighteenth-century Black artistic practices, as well as to theorize these practices as ways of thinking through the fundamental dilemma of living in circumstances of unfreedom. In addition to looking at writings by such authors as Phillis Wheatley, Ignatius Sancho, Ottobah Cugoano, Olaudah Equiano, David Walker, and Mary Prince, we will look at works of visual art by Prince Demah, Guillaume Lethière, Moses Williams, Joshua Johnson, John Tyley, Sarah Mapps Douglass, and David Drake. We will also consider other art forms, including music and dance, and draw comparisons to present-day works of Black writing and art.

**ENGL 5651: Writing Center Theory and Praxis (RW) (Tuesdays 5:30 - 8:00 PM)**[Elisabeth Buck](/academics/departments/english/faculty/elisabeth-h-buck-/)

This course will explore what it means to be a writing center practitioner through empirical, practical, and theoretical experiences. Working one-on-one with another student—while ostensibly a straightforward process—can instead reveal the many complexities of language, education, and culture. As such, the Writing Center is the ideal site through which to explore nuances of speech, conversational dynamics, ways to dismantle hegemonic language practices, and, critically, strategies for communicating knowledge. No prior writing center experience is required for this class, but this course will be useful to anyone who has an interest in teaching and/or tutoring writing.**CRN 53474**
