[ENGL 5027: To Bear Witness: Poetry & Social Justice ](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/search/?search=ENGL+5027)**Elisabeth Frost**

**CRN 52094**

How do we practice writing poetry as witnesses of our time? In her important 1993 anthology Against Forgetting, Carolyn Forché defines “poetry of witness” as writing that serves as evidence, voicing resistance against political violence or trauma. Since the 1990s, a revival of documentary poetics and a transformed media landscape have widened our sense of “witness.” In this workshop, we will explore a range of modes and strategies that allow us, as poets, to engage with challenging material, whether historical or contemporary. Together, we will imagine and create an ethical poetics of witness.

*Fulfills DI, Rhetoric & Writing Adv Cert*[ENGL 6108: The Dynamics of Space and Place: Early Modern and Other English Texts](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/search/?search=ENGL+6108)**Heather Dubrow**

**CRN 52097**

Who "owns" the forest in

*As You Like It*or the island in

*The Tempest*or the spaceship in Vonnegut's

*Slaughter-House Five*-- and how and why does ownership take different forms in such terrains? How do concepts of space and place interact with cultural issues (e.g., gender, subjectivity etc.) as well as formal issues such as the workings of stanzas and genres? We'll discuss these and many other questions primarily in relation to early modern writings (in the sense of ones composed between about 1500-1660) but with several opportunities to engage with texts from other periods as well. While our primary focus will be academic careers, the course will also offer preparation for some other possible careers and will include the option of a creative project. We will also expand and deepen expertise in challenges like teaching and oral presentations at conferences and elsewhere (we'll have a course mini-conference).

[ENGL 6235: Medieval Travel Narrative](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/search/?search=ENGL+6235)**Suzanne Yeager****CRN 52098**Some of the most engaging questions about the Middle Ages have to do with the narratives of cultures in contact. Join me and other scholars who work on the medieval travel genre, finding in its discourses productive sites for exploration of premodern race, gender, religion, and more. This course will focus on a range of traditions, including crusade romances, such as "Richard, Coeur de Lion" in light of contemporary chronicler, Roger of Howden’s, "Chronica." Pilgrim and merchant narratives, from Egeria to Margery Kempe, and Mandeville to Marco Polo, will provide a contrast to romance and chronicle modes. We will also study the accounts by European missionaries who left extensive records of their interactions with Mongols. This course is designed to contextualize travel within the medieval world as we read and discuss those narratives as they relate to cultural projects of salvation, conquest, and conversion.

[ENGL 6769: Finnegans Wake](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/search/?search=ENGL+6769)**Moshe Gold**

**CRN 52099**

One of the most intriguing and entertaining literary works ever crafted, James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake sends us on seriously hilarious trips around the world, through human (especially Irish) history, and into the sleeping mind. Joyce’s “Book of the Night,” a comic masterpiece, constructs not one thing, but "two thinks at a time," multiple meanings that uproariously cross national, linguistic, sexual, historical—just about all kinds of—boundaries. A resurrection of dead ends that generates new beginnings (finn--again), this “collideorscape” asks readers to "wipe their glosses with what they know,” and revolutionizes all kinds of creative energies and theoretical discourses. Sometimes it makes sense; sometimes it doesn't. Nearly always though, things emerge that charm, surprise, and delight.

[ENGL 5125: Hybrid Forms and Literary Liminality](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/search/?search=ENGL+5125)**Meghan Dahn****CRN 51709**

With each development in printing and publishing technology, our understanding of what literature can be shifts. Much of what we study when we study literature is intricately tied to the economic means of production and distribution of that literature. Even as commercial and generic pressures influence what people write, experimental forms innovate at the fringes. In this course we will come to a deeper understanding of the ways in which hybrid forms, multimedia writing, and experimental texts have developed alongside the publishing industry in the 20th- and 21st-centuries. We will consider a wide range of authors such as Claudia Rankine, Teju Cole, Roland Barthes, Wanda Coleman, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Carolina Ebeid, Anne Carson, Kate Zambreno, and others. Students will work on two main projects: one will take a familiar scholarly form, the other will deliberately challenge the typical forms of scholarly production.

[ENGL 5133: Fiction and Other Art Forms](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/search/?search=ENGL+5133)**Stacey D’Erasmo****CRN 50751**

Neither the writing nor the reading of fiction happens in an aesthetic vacuum. We read, watch, listen, feel, and even taste all manner of other art forms, and these experiences inspire us, move us, and often find their way into what and how we write. In this course, we will explore the influence of music, the visual arts, film, architecture, and the internet on the fiction we read and write, and vice versa. Authors may include Sofia Samatar, Ali Smith, Gaston Bachelard, Toni Morrison, and Albert Murray.

[ENGL 5211: Introduction to Old English Language and Literature](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/search/?search=ENGL+5211)**Thomas O’Donnell****CRN 50752**

Students will receive a comprehensive introduction to the language and will read a representative selection of prose and poetry in the original language, including The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, works by King Alfred, short poems and selections from Beowulf. Students will gain experience reading from medieval manuscripts as well as from printed editions.

[ENGL 5634: Modernists/Victorians](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/search/?search=ENGL+5634)**Christopher GoGwilt****CRN 50753**

This course examines landmarks of Victorian literature and transatlantic English modernism, exploring breaks and continuities between Victorian and Modernist writers. Covering major texts from the 1840s to the 1940s, the course will also consider theoretical arguments about the status of the "classic" in literary history, and specifically as these define the fields of Victorian studies, modernism, modernity, and the classifications of "English" and "American" literature.

[ENGL 5717: Transatlantic Women Modernists](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/search/?search=ENGL+5717)**Anne Fernald****CRN 50754**

This class looks at gender and modernism on both sides of the Atlantic. We will read a generous selection of women modernists, canonical and noncanonical, representing high modernism and “bad modernism” (to use Mao and Walkowitz’s term), fiction, film, and poetry from the first half of the 20th century. Our transatlantic focus offers a special opportunity to examine multicultural and cosmopolitan modernisms: many women writers in this period were travelers and immigrants. We will also analyze the complex and often fraught relationships among feminist criticism, feminist theory, and theories of modernism, both in the early 20th century and today. Authors include: Gertrude Stein, Zora Neale Hurston, Elizabeth Bishop, Una Marson, Jean Rhys, Bessie Smith, and Virginia Woolf.

[ENGL 5845: Early American Novel](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/search/?search=engl+5845)**Leonard Cassuto****CRN 50755**

This course will sketch the tradition of the American novel from its beginnings through the Civil War. To that end, we’ll be reading a selection of representative early American novels—representative, that is, of the way that we view the history of the American novel today. We’ll be reading with several goals in mind. First, we will consider the way that the American novel comes into being: what literary categories it draws upon, and how. We will also trace the ways that American novels came to be valued (some more than others), in their own time and ours. And we will consider different ways of reading early American novels, employing approaches old and new. Authors range from traditional canonical standards such as Hawthorne and Melville to more recent additions to the tradition like Lydia Maria Child and William Wells Brown.
