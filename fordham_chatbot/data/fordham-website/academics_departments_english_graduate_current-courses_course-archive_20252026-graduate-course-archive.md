[ENGL 5029: The Invention of Nature](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/search/?search=ENGL+5029)

Lawrence Kramer**CRN 53469**

The idea of nature as the autonomous realm of nonhuman life is essentially literary in origin, dating from the early modern era and extending to the present. Nature has come into being in writing, and its elements--animal, vegetable, and mineral--have been brought together under a changing series of rubrics including landscape, wilderness, environment, world, and ecosystem. This course will trace the writing of nature from the early-modern representations of Shakespeare and Montaigne through the pre- and post-Darwinian writings of the nineteenth century (Wordsworth, Poe, Thoreau, and Darwin himself) to modern representations of nature in relation to civilization, race, migration, and ecological crisis (D. H. Lawrence, Elizabeth Bishop, Annie Dillard, Anne Carson). Topics include the aesthetics of nature, the boundaries between the human and nonhuman worlds, and the relationship between the human and the animal.

[ENGL 5189: Birdsong](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/search/?search=ENGL+5189)

Sarah Zimmerman**CRN 53470**

The close association of poetry and birdsong is ancient and global. We explore that endlessly renewable connection with a special emphasis on Romantic-era poetry. Writers have long listened closely to birds and been inspired by their singing to experiment with literary innovation. Yet the question of how we listen to birds takes on new urgency in our own era of climate crisis, marked by declining bird populations and extinction. Our wide range of readings features birds alternately sounding warnings as canaries in the coal mine and figuring hope as “the thing with feathers.” We take an interdisciplinary approach to the topic of birds inspired by environmental and sound studies in reading literature and non-fiction prose, including essays and memoirs. We put our learning into practice by birdwatching in local parks, taking advantage of NYC’s location on the Atlantic flyway. Readings include works by Phillis Wheatley Peters, William Wordsworth, Dorothy Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats, and John Clare.

[ENGL 5196: Master Class: Dragons, Daggers, and Dukes: Writing Fantasy/Sci-Fi, Romance/Mystery](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/search/?search=ENGL+5196)

Mary Bly**CRN 53471**Genre fiction is, by definition, writing that bows to limitation: Conventions shape the parameters of a story. Yet, in excellent genre fiction, the imaginary world is doubly creative despite constraints or conventions. In this class, we’ll tackle bestsellers—pop fiction that engages and enthralls readers. We will study and experiment before setting into a final manuscript in the genre of your choice.

[ENGL 5223: Embodied Research in Medieval Drama](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/search/?search=ENGL+5223) **Andrew Albin****CRN 53721**

What did it feel like to hammer nails into Jesus’s hands or to intone judgements at Doomsday or to dance with the Deadly Sins on an open-air stage in the late Middle Ages? How far can we go in reconstructing, practicing, and sharing medieval performance styles today? What kind of knowledge might the evidence of our own bodies afford us in support of our study of the medieval past? In this course, we will tug at this knot of questions through careful reading, writing, discussion, and experimentation across an uncommon collection of sources, including medieval English playtexts and documents; scholarship on medieval drama and its reenactment; theoretical texts in performance studies, theater-making, and embodied technique; and the witness of our own embodied and reflective experience. Relevant research areas include medieval drama, history of the body, history of experience, history of spirituality, critical temporality studies, non-discursive epistemology, affect studies. Primary source readings will include much of the corpus of surviving Middle English drama supplemented by the Records of Early English Drama project; further readings include Sharon Aronson-Lehavi, Augusto Boal, Rob Boddice, Jerzy Grotowski, Andre Lepecki, Lauren Mancia, Mary Overlie, Rebecca Schneider, Matthew Sergi, Mark Smith, Ben Spatz, and others. Course assignments will center close reading, scholarly research, and academic writing, with options for digital humanities and performance-driven research, undertaken independently or collaboratively. Students may also opt into a parallel laboratory in Mary Overlie’s Six Viewpoints and/or a public performance of medieval drama at the Cloisters Museum in Spring 2026. While helpful, no prior knowledge of Middle English or Latin is expected or required.

[ENGL 5252: Exhibiting Latinidad: Curation/Display/Intervention](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/search/?search=ENGL+5252)

Robb Hernández**CRN 53473**

Museums have played critical roles in defining Latinidad for mass publics in the U.S. and abroad. In particular, curators and their exhibits can assume great power over our understandings of authenticity, cultural authority, and the historical “truth” about Latinx cultures. By retracing exhibition histories from classic shows like Cuba-USA and the Decade Show to the Getty’s Pacific Standard Time LA/LA initiative, we will confront the different material, textual, and visual dilemmas provoked by museums. We will also ponder alternative exhibition practices for Latinidad’s representation and remembrance in the future.

[ENGL 5544: Eighteenth-Century Black Thought](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/search/?search=ENGL+5544)

Julie Kim**CRN 54688**

This course will examine Black writing and art in the eighteenth century, which was defined both by the rise of Atlantic slavery and by resistance to it. How did enslaved individuals describe their experiences of bondage and captivity? How did they respond to rhetorics of racial difference and dehumanization? What alternatives to enslavement, including possibilities of escape, fugitivity, and freedom, did they imagine, and what forms did they deploy to express these alternatives? We will consider these questions to understand the richness and complexity of eighteenth-century Black artistic practices, as well as to theorize these practices as ways of thinking through the fundamental dilemma of living in circumstances of unfreedom. In addition to looking at writings by such authors as Phillis Wheatley, Ignatius Sancho, Ottobah Cugoano, Olaudah Equiano, David Walker, and Mary Prince, we will look at works of visual art by Prince Demah, Guillaume Lethière, Moses Williams, Joshua Johnson, John Tyley, Sarah Mapps Douglass, and David Drake. We will also consider other art forms, including music and dance, and draw comparisons to present-day works of Black writing and art. **~**

[ENGL 5651: Writing Center Theory and Praxis (RW)](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/search/?search=ENGL+5651)**Elisabeth Buck****CRN 53474**

This course will explore what it means to be a writing center practitioner through empirical, practical, and theoretical experiences. Working one-on-one with another student—while ostensibly a straightforward process—can instead reveal the many complexities of language, education, and culture. As such, the Writing Center is the ideal site through which to explore nuances of speech, conversational dynamics, ways to dismantle hegemonic language practices, and, critically, strategies for communicating knowledge. No prior writing center experience is required for this class, but this course will be useful to anyone who has an interest in teaching and/or tutoring writing.
