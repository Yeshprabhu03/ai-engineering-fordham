# English Doctoral Consortium

## Inter-University Doctoral Consortium (IUDC)

Fordham participates in a consortium with several universities in the New York City area. With the permission of both the home and host institutions, PhD students can take one or more courses at any other school in the consortium. Students register and receive credit at their home institution, and the home institution covers tuition costs.

PhD students must have completed at least one year of full-time doctoral study at Fordham before taking an IUDC course. Only one consortium course may be taken per semester. Consortium courses may not be taken during the summer.

IUDC creates opportunities for PhD students to supplement their coursework and build relationships with renowned scholars across the wider NYC region. To see what graduate courses are on offer each semester, visit the following member institution websites:
