# English Department Post-Graduate Placement

The Department of English is dedicated to preparing students for a variety of career paths, with particular focus on the academic job market, academic administration, and secondary school education. We admit a small incoming cohort of students each year in order to provide each student with personalized support and guidance as they enter and navigate the job market. For more than ten years, our graduate students have been supported by a dedicated job Placement Officer from our faculty, who organizes roundtables, helps applicants with drafting and refining job and fellowship application materials, and aids graduate students in preparing for interviews and campus visits. Our record of recent placements below demonstrates a proven track record of success securing full-time employment for our students inside and outside academia.

We have a rigorous job market preparation program, coordinated by the Director of Placement and Professional Development. In the spring prior to students’ job searches, the DPPD holds an information session that acquaints potential candidates with the process. After students have declared their intentions to go on the academic job market, the DPPD assigns each candidate a faculty mentor from the Job Placement Committee; over the summer and into the fall, that mentor guides the candidate through the development of rigorous application documents. In the late fall, the DPPD organizes mock interviews for all job candidates, and the department continues to advise students (about interviewing, campus visits, and offer negotiations) well into the spring semester. Graduates returning to the market in their years after finishing the PhD also continue to receive comprehensive advising and support from the department.

The job placement program is coordinated by the Director of Placement and Professional Development (Prof. Maria Farland). Current students may access the Job Placement Handbook (please contact [Professor Farland](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d5b3b4a7b9b4bbb195b3baa7b1bdb4b8fbb0b1a0b3b4a7b9b4bbb195b3baa7b1bdb4b8fbb0b1a0b3b4a7b9b4bbb195b3baa7b1bdb4b8fbb0b1a0b3b4a7b9b4bbb195b3baa7b1bdb4b8fbb0b1a0b3b4a7b9b4bbb195b3baa7b1bdb4b8fbb0b1a0b3b4a7b9b4bbb195b3baa7b1bdb4b8fbb0b1a0b3b4a7b9b4bbb195b3baa7b1bdb4b8fbb0b1a0)).
