Following a solid scientific grounding in the first two years, upper level students can choose from a selection of specialized courses such as applied statistics, tropical ecology, and environmental chemistry. Environmental Science majors will also gain valuable experience from the required independent science research project on an environmental topic, or an internship at an environmental firm or government agency.


Fordham’s interdisciplinary environmental science education will provide numerous options to graduates. Government and private sector opportunities for Environmental Science graduates include careers in environmental conservation or monitoring, ecological system or climate modeling, environmental policy development, education, and environmental consulting. Graduates may be employed in areas such as environmental research, biological conservation, developing environmental regulations, or monitoring compliance with those regulations.


The Environmental Science program will develop critical thinking skills and ensure that students are well-prepared for further graduate or professional study in science, engineering, business, and law.
