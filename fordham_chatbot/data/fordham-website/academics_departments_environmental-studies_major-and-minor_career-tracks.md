# Environmental Studies Career Tracks

In preparation for employment and graduate school, the following sample career tracks can be pursued through major electives, internships, the capstone research thesis course, and a minor or second major (up to two courses can be double-counted toward a minor or second major). A career track does not need to be officially declared and does not appear on your transcript, but can be recorded on your resume and in any letters of recommendation you request from the program director.

The sample list of career tracks below also provides recommendations for a complementary minor or second major.
