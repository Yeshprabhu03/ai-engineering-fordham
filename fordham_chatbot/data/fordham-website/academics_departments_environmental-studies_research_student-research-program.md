# Environmental Studies Student Research Program

The program strongly encourages you to conduct original research in courses, internships, study abroad, and the senior thesis.

Students can take advantage of the Rose Hill campus [undergraduate research program](/academics/research/student-research/), which provides funding, conference presentation, and journal publication opportunities during the academic year and summer sessions.

Strong research skills and accomplishments documented in your resume give you an edge in employment and graduate-school applications.

The capstone research experience for majors is the senior thesis course ENST 4000 – Senior Thesis. Students spend an entire semester on an original research project and publish their work in an online journal format.
