Philosophy, Waisan is well-trained in classical Confucianism and neo-Confucianism (especially in Song-Ming Dynasty). Fascinated by the reaction of a Confucian society towards Christianity and the dialects between the two, he did his undergraduate thesis on moral naturalismin late Imperial China. His background both in Confucianism and Christianity makes him very sensitive to the conflicts in moral judgements between cultures and religion, as well as the how the paradigm of morality has shifted over the history. Apart from being a philosophy student, Waisan has found and served as president as the chairperson of a charitable organization which aims op provide free tutorial education to underprivileged students in Hong Kong, where the income disparity between the rich and the poor is ranked 1st among the world.
