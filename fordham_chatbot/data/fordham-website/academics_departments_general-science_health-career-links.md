# General Science Health Career Links

The General Science major attracts students interested in pursuing further studies in the health professions. This major suits the needs of such students by providing them with the introductory science and math courses they need for further studies while allowing them the flexibility of including other courses they need (such as statistics, psychology, anatomy, physiology, etc.) for acceptance to health professional schools. Such options are not often permitted by discipline-based majors, which require upper-level science courses essential only to those who pursue advanced studies in that discipline.
