I study histories of labor, gender, and technology in modern imperial Britain. My first book, entitled
, will be published by the University of California Press in February 2026.[Respectability on the Line](https://www.ucpress.edu/books/respectability-on-the-line/paper)*Respectability on the Line*offers a social and cultural history of railway labor in Britain and colonial India from the 1840s through World War I. Using company records, I show how executives shaped the domestic and working lives of higher-grade employees with an eye to cultivating their respectability. Meanwhile workers' writings reveal how railway towns provided opportunities for some employees to maintain non-heteronormative living arrangements. The book tracks these histories of everyday life while also outlining stories of early trade unionism. In Britain, railway unionists established benefit funds that mimicked company-sponsored provident funds, while in colonial India workers fought to gain access to company benefits on equal terms. This comparative study shows how industrial labor was made through conflict, subversion, and accommodation across an uneven imperial field.I am interested in advising graduate students who intend to study global labor history, the history of gender and sexuality, and the history of modern imperial Britain. -
