I came to Fordham in 2002 after teaching at Columbia University and the University at Florida at Gainesville. I specialize in the socio-cultural history of modern Italy from the Risorgimento to the present and currently my main research interests focus on the history of nationalism and racism in connection with the construction of Italian – and more generally European - national identities. My most recent book,

*Il colore della Repubblica*(forthcoming in English as*Race in Post-fascist Italy*) explores the persistence of ideas of race after the collapse of fascism and their impact on the representations and life experience of the children born from the encounter between Italian women and Black Allied soldiers at the end of the Second World War.In my approach I engage with interdisciplinary perspectives and in previous work I studied a variety of subjects from the discourse of national character (the subject of my second book,

*Italian Vices*), to the nativist rhetoric of the Northern League, from the politics of emotions in national-patriotism, to the history and politics of social quantification and the making of social categories and classifications (on which I wrote my first book, the award-winning*Numbers and Nationhood*). Most recently I began exploring the development of anti-racist sensibilities in post-1945 Italy in connection with the history of the civil right struggle in the US and the influence of African American music.My research had been funded by various institutions, among which the Italian Academy for Advanced Studies in America (at Columbia University) and the National Humanities Center.
