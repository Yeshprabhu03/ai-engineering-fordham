Dr. Rigogne’s research explores the links between commerce, culture and communication in eighteenth-century France. His first book,

*Between State and Market: Printing and Bookselling in Eighteenth-Century France,*published in 2007, explores the transformations in the production and consumption of print in France during the Enlightenment. He has also published several articles and essays in American and European scholarly journals and collections of essays on eighteenth-century French printing and bookselling.His current research focuses on the history of the French café from the introduction of coffee-houses in the 1660s through the end of the French Revolution in 1800. He is finishing a book and has published several articles on the history of cafés.

Dr. Rigogne is also working on a new book project on the history of communication in eighteenth-century France. By tracking the creation of news and the diffusion of information in the 1740 and 1750s through a wide array of media and communication channels, he will show how public opinion formed on the ground.

Dr. Rigogne welcomes inquiries from students interested in graduate research on 17th- and 18th- French social and cultural history, and other fields related to early modern media/communication or early modern food history.
