**Research Interests:**

My specialization is in the Italian diaspora especially in North America. I am currently working on a project investigating Italian Americans and their impact and participation in/on United States educational systems. I am also interested in historic and international Italian identities, transatlantic fascism and anti-fascism, and anarchist and socialist thought and movements within the Italian diaspora.
