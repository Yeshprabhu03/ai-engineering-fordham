# The Loomie Prize

The History Department of Fordham University annually awards the Loomie Prize (with a cash prize and certificate) to the best seminar paper produced during the previous academic year. All MA and PhD students who have taken the proseminar/seminar sequence or a research tutorial are eligible.

The award honors the many years of teaching and service by Rev. Albert J. Loomie SJ, a long-time member of the department who died in November, 2002. Educated at Fordham Preparatory School, Fr. Loomie received his BA from Loyola University in Chicago; a PhL from West Baden College; his STL from Woodstock College; and a PhD from London University. He joined the Fordham faculty in 1958, where he rose to full professor in 1969, served as Department Chair in 1978-81, and retired in 1993.

In addition to *The Spanish Elizabethans: The English Exiles at the Court of Philip II *(1963), Fr. Loomie wrote seven books and numerous articles that explored Catholicism in England following the death of Queen Elizabeth I in 1603. He specialized in tracing Spanish influence in court and society during the early Stuart dynasty, and was equally adept in the diplomatic and political history of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Spain and England. His other books include: *Toleration and Diplomacy: The Religious Issue in Anglo-Spanish Relations*, 1603-05 (1963); *Spain and the Jacobean Catholics* (2 vols., 1973 and 1978); and *Spain and the Early Stuarts,* *1585-1655* (1996).
