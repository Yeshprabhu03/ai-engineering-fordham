# About the O'Connell Initiative

During the last five hundred years capitalism emerged in its mature and developed form as a result of European encounters with the rest of the world. Despite occasional resistance, it has become the dominant means of production, exchange, and consumption of human and material resources throughout the world. Its system of relations has created unimaginable wealth as well as forms of inequality and environmental waste. While many have embraced its modes of production, some, especially in the 20th century, resisted it with alternative economic models. We believe that history — read on a global level -- offers powerful analytical methods for thinking about the transformative aspects of capitalism.

The O’Connell Initiative for the Global History of Capitalism is a forum for intellectual exploration. It brings together scholars of every aspect of capitalism, from its earliest medieval manifestations to its twenty-first century consequences across the globe. It supports groundbreaking research and teaching on global capitalism and engages with the public through lectures, debates, and workshops.

The O’Connell Initiative in the Global History of Capitalism is supported by generous gifts from Fordham alumnus Robert J. O’Connell, FCRH '65
