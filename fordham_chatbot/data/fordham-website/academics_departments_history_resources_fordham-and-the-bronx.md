# Fordham and the Bronx

Fordham University’s connection to what is now the Bronx dates back to 1841. As the Bronx borough expanded in territory and population density over the years, the Rose Hill campus has remained an integral educational mainstay in the community. The following resources highlight the unique history and culture of the borough as well as Fordham's place within it as the Jesuit university of New York.
