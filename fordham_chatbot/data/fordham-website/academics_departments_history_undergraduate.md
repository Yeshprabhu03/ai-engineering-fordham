What do Joe Biden, Martha Stewart, Conan O’Brian, Kareem Adbul Jabbar, Sonia Sotomayor, W. E. B. du Bois, and King Charles III have in common? They were all History majors, along with many others who have successfully pursued careers in fields as diverse as business, politics, teaching, media, and even professional sports. Studying history requires you to conduct research, assess often conflicting evidence, sort through misinformation, and offer effective and convincing interpretations in oral and written communications, all skill-sets that rank particularly high in a [recent survey](http://www.aacu.org/leap/presidentstrust/compact/2013SurveySummary) of what most influences employers when hiring. Indeed, well over 90 per cent of those surveyed say that the ability to “think critically, communicate clearly, and solve complex problems is more important than the undergraduate major” chosen. There are a huge range of [career options](https://www.historians.org/jobs-and-professional-development/career-resources/careers-for-history-majors) for History majors out there.
