# Internships and Service Opportunities for History Students

## Internships

Internships can be a valuable experience for undergraduate and graduate students. Internships give students new and useful skills. Students gain historical skills: reading and understanding a range of evidence, interpreting and gauging different sources and viewpoints, making clear, evidence-based arguments, assessing and critiquing existing scholarship; practical skills: project development and management, working in groups, professional writing and oral communication, software and programming literacy, leadership qualities, time management; and helps professional development by networking with professionals in the field, building relationships with professional institutions, and resume building.

Students can take internships either for pay or for credit. They can take the internship as either a tutorial (more reading/writing) or as a supervised internship (less reading/writing). The number of credits determines the amount of work they do for the instructor. It could be from 1 to 4. Students receiving credit for an internship need to fill out the following [internship form](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/history/pdfs/internship_form.pdf). If you have any further questions, please contact the Undergraduate Academic Advisors [Dr. Sal Acosta](/academics/departments/history/faculty/sal-acosta/) (RH) and [Dr. Christopher Maginn](/academics/departments/history/faculty/christopher-maginn/) (LC), or the Director of Grad Studies, [Dr. Rosemary Wakeman.](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c3a4b1a2a7abaab0b7acb1ba83a5acb1a7aba2aeeda6a7b6)
