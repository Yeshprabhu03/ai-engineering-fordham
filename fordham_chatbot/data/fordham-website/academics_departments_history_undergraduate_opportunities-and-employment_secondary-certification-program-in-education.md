# Secondary Certification Program in Education for History Majors

In their senior year History Majors may obtain a certificate qualifying them to seek employment in public schools through Fordham’s Graduate School of Education at Lincoln Center. The program is full-time and takes the entire senior year to complete. As a result, you must have finished all requirements for your History Major by the end of your junior year. Students must apply at the end of their sophomore year or in the fall of their junior year.
