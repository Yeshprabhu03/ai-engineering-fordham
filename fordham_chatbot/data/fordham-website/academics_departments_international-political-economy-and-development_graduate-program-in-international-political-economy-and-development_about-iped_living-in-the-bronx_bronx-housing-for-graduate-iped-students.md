# Bronx Housing for Graduate IPED Students

Fordham students have several options for housing, including Fordham-sponsored housing and private off-campus housing.

### Fordham-Sponsored Housing

Some of our students choose to live in our new graduate dormitory, Arthur 2. It is a short two-block walk from the university’s campus and is operated by the University’s Office of Residential Life. Housing assignments for Arthur 2 are usually made on a priority basis by the Dean’s Office. Priority is given to students based on the distance they are traveling to come to Fordham and on whether or not they are on a fellowship. For more detailed information about prices and housing options available to graduate students at Arthur 2, contact the Office of Residential Life:

### Private Off-Campus Housing

Most graduate students prefer the affordability and convenience of living in nearby neighborhoods. The most popular nearby neighborhood among our graduate students are:

Manhattan, Lower Westchester County and Eastern Connecticut are also an easy commute via Metro North trains which stop adjacent to the Fordham Campus.

The University's Office of Residential Life also maintains a listing of private off-campus housing in the Bronx which is available at no cost to all students.

Students who conduct their search for apartments before or during the first week of August are almost guaranteed to have access to the best apartments on the market. We do not recommend waiting until the third or fourth week of August to look for an apartment.

See the links below for additional housing options for graduate students.
