# Emerging Markets and Country Risk Analysis

## Summer Program: TBA

Fordham's Summer Evening Program in Emerging Financial Markets and Country Risk Analysis is an intensive 10-week program designed for international business professionals as well as current graduate students. The program offers you the opportunity to develop the political, economic, and financial analytical skills that you need to evaluate the potential rewards and risks associated with the dynamic and volatile financial markets of Asia, Latin America, Africa, and Eastern Europe.

We strongly encourage visiting graduate students in the program to take full advantage of spending a summer in the world's leading financial center by doing an internship during the day with a major New York financial institution.

Government analysts may also find the program beneficial, given the importance of economic factors and emerging economies in today's geopolitical world.

All students who successfully complete the two-course sequence (Political Risk Analysis and Emerging Markets), with a grade point average of 3.0 or better, will earn a Certificate in Emerging Markets and Country Risk Analysis.

### Application Deadline

(The Certificate Program is registered with the New York State Department of Education, Hegis Code #2204, Program Code #22615.)
