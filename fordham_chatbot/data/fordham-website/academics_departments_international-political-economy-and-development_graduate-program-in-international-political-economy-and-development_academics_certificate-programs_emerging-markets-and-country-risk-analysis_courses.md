**POSC 6991 - Political Risk Analysis (3 credits)**

Professor Geoff D. Porter ( Syllabus)

This course is primarily a research/writing course that culminates in an original paper where you will be required to analyze the political risks associated with a country of your choosing. While there will be only a minimal number of lectures, the instructor will serve as your individual mentor as you develop and present your paper. As part of the process of writing this paper you will study methods used to assess and manage the political risks associated with foreign investment and international business; learn how to assess the domestic political climate of a country by examining factors such as the levels of political violence, the stability of the government, and the existence of political democracy; and make an overall assessment of a country's economic climate by evaluating key macroeconomic indicators. You will also learn the importance of studying the foreign relations of a country in order to evaluate the likelihood of any conflict it might have with its neighbors.

**ECON 5541 - Emerging Markets (3 credits)**

Professor Henry Schwalbenberg ( Syllabus)

This course explores the dynamics of emerging financial markets in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America. Complimenting and expanding upon the skills learned in POSC 6991 Political Risk Analysis, students learn how to prepare a country study regarding their country's leading macroeconomic indicators, the stability of its foreign exchange market, and the likely returns and risks associated with its stock market. Real time data is obtained from the university's Bloomberg Terminal and the internet. Additional data is available from standard international financial statistical sources. Students are taught how to analyze this data using standard statistical software to forecast trends as well as to estimate returns, volatility and cross correlations. An optimal portfolio of equity investments in emerging markets is estimated.
