The Graduate Program's Master of Arts in International Political Economy and Development (IPED) is a 12-course curriculum designed primarily for future and present professionals involved with international economic issues as policy analysts and administrators. Our students usually find employment as financial analysts and economists in business; as policy analysts, economists, and program managers in government; or as project managers in the non-profit sector. Such careers require an understanding of political and social perspectives and demand knowledge of economic analysis. As a capstone experience, students must pass a comprehensive examination based on their course work.

Completion of twelve courses (36 credits) beyond the bachelor's degree is required, including four core courses (12 credits), one quantitative methods course (3 credits), and seven electives (21 credits). Satisfactory completion of an internship for those lacking relevant professional experience and a comprehensive examination are also required.

Full-time students can complete the program in three semesters while part-time students can complete the program in two years, including two summers.
