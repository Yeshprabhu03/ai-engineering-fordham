The core curriculum for the Master of Arts in International Political Economy and Development (IPED) begins by providing you with a rigorous foundation in economic, political, and quantitative analysis at the graduate level. The core then builds on this solid foundation by offering you an advanced interdisciplinary study of global economic relations and international development issues. At the end of your program you will be required to take a comprehensive examination that serves as a capstone experience by forcing you to integrate much of the material you learned in the core courses.
