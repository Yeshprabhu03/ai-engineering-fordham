# Global Environmental and Resource Economics

![Global Resource Economics](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/international-political-economy-and-development/The_Specialization_in_Global_Resource_Econ_1_MD.jpeg)

The Specialization in Global Environmental and Resource Economics is designed for IPED students who have an intermediate level undergraduate background in both microeconomics and macroeconomics. It is specifically designed to train economists for public service who will have a global appreciation and understanding of environmental issues and the economic role of natural resources in today’s increasingly integrated world.

To ensure that you have a strong economic foundation to understand global environmental issues you will take International Economic Policy, International Monetary Policy, Economic Development Policy and Applied Econometrics.

To provide you with a strong background in environmental issues and resource economics you will be required to take Environmental and Resource Economics along with Agriculture & Development and/or Epidemics and Development. Because of its heavy economic content (21 credits of economics plus a statistics course, Applied Econometrics), anyone completing it will qualify for designation as an economist by the US federal government.

The US Presidential Management Fellow Program has also designated Resource Economics as a STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) field, which can be an important designation for individuals seeking careers with the US government. The below plan of study will need to be modified for students lacking an intermediate level undergraduate background in both microeconomics and macroeconomics.
