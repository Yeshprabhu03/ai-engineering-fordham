# Graduate IPED Health Insurance and Immunization Information

The IPED Program requires all its students who are participating in overseas international practical training programs to have adequate medical insurance and proper immunizations.

### Medical Insurance

Medical Expense Coverage, Emergency Medical Assistance and Medical Evacuation benefits are required for students traveling overseas. Many private health insurance plans do not provide any overseas coverage or medical evacuation. Two Plans that meet these needs are:
