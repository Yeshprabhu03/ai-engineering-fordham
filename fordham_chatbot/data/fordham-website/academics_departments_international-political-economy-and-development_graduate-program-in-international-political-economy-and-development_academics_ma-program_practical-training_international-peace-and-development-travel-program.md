All matriculated IPED students in good academic standing are invited to apply for an International Peace and Development (IPD) Travel Scholarship. In cooperation with [Catholic Relief Services](http://www.crs.org/), Fordham awards up to four International Peace and Development Travel Scholarships each year to finance IPED students who wish to do a six-month-long internship overseas working in international relief and development.

The estimated IPD Travel Scholarship's stipend is US$12,951. This is intended to cover the cost of airfare to and from the country of assignment, local travel between your residence and your work site, as well as the costs of housing and board while in the country. Health insurance, including emergency medical evacuation, is included separately.

During the overseas assignment, you will be registered for IPED 67XX (IPD Scholarship) during the Spring and Summer terms. Registration will ensure that you are covered by the university's liability insurance. The internship assignment lasts for six months - from mid-January until mid-July.

Previous assignments with Catholic Relief Services (CRS) were in the following countries: Brazil, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, East Timor, Ecuador, El Salvador, Ghana, Guinea, Haiti, Honduras, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mali, Nicaragua, Philippines, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Uganda, West Bank, and Zimbabwe.
