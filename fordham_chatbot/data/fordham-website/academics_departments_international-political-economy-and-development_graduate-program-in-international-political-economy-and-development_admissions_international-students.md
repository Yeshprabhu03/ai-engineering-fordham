Fordham University encourages applications from international students. Students are recommended to apply early, to allow extra time for international mail and preparation of visa documents. The [Office of Graduate Admissions](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/admissions/) is happy to answer any questions about the application process. The [Office for International Services](/academics/academic-resources/international-services/) should be contacted with questions regarding visas and immigration. Additionally, the Office for International Services provides pre-arrival information to help prepare you for your trip, and orientation upon arrival to explain immigration matters and assist in adjustment to the United States.

**Academic Transcripts**

To be eligible for admission, applicants must hold a four-year bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university in the United States, or the equivalent of a U.S. bachelor’s degree from a recognized institution abroad (for some countries, this may be a three-year degree from a [member institution](https://ehea.info/page-full_members) within the [Bologna Process](http://www.ehea.info/)). If you are applying during your final (senior) year of undergraduate study, you may submit your application with an unofficial transcript that includes all completed coursework to date.

When you apply, you are required to upload unofficial transcripts from the institution where you earned or will earn your bachelor’s degree, and if applicable, master’s degree, including any institutions where transfer credits counted toward either an undergraduate or graduate-level degree.

**International students: **Transcripts from previously attended post-secondary institutions must be submitted in English or with a certified English translation. For academic transcripts from institutions outside the United States, applicants are encouraged to obtain a course-by-course credential evaluation. See [GSAS International Students](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/admissions/international-students/) for more information.

If you are offered admission to a GSAS program and accept the offer, you must submit official final transcripts with final grades and the title of the degree conferred. Official transcripts must be received by Fordham GSAS Admissions **before the first day of classes**.

### Exemptions to the English Language Requirement

Exemptions are considered on a case-by-case basis and are generally permitted for international applicants who:

- are native English speakers from countries where English is an official language (

- you received an undergraduate or graduate degree from a university in India. (In some cases, we may request language proficiency test scores.)

GSAS reserves the right to require a language proficiency evaluation from any applicant. Requests for exemption from this requirement should be indicated directly within the application. The Fordham English Language Test (FELT), administered by Fordham’s Institute of [American Language and Culture (IALC)](/academics/academic-resources/esl/), may be required for those students whose English proficiency scores do not meet GSAS program requirements. Additional coursework may also be recommended by the IALC.

Students are permitted to register for two GSAS courses during the academic term in which they are completing any IALC-recommended coursework, which generally occurs during their first semester of study.

**Please note:** Tuition costs associated with the learning of English as a second language are the responsibility of the student and will not be covered by a GSAS tuition scholarship. GSAS merit-based tuition scholarships are not applicable to the costs of additional coursework recommended by the IALC.

**Please note:** Applicants who do not wish to be considered for university merit based financial aid may substitute GMAT scores in place of the GRE. These individuals are still eligible for financial aid in the form of loans.

Admission decisions are based solely on merit without regard to citizenship, ethnicity, nationality, race, sex, or religion.

### Immigration Information and Immunization Requirements

![IPED students at Cape Point, South Africa](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/international-political-economy-and-development/International_Students_2_MD.jpeg)

*Student Visa and Exchange Visitor Visa*

In accordance with the regulations of the United States Department of Justice and its Immigration and Naturalization Service, international students must obtain an appropriate visa for study in the United States. For most international students this will be the F-1 student visa. With proper documentation, Fordham's Office of International Students can issue the I-20 certificate of eligibility, used to obtain the F-1 student visa at a U.S. Consulate or Embassy abroad. Some students will be issued an IAP-66 form to apply for a J-1 exchange visitor visa. Students must provide verification of adequate financial resources to cover education and living expenses for at least the first year. Proper documentation includes the notarized affidavit of support form, submitted with supporting documentation, such as an official bank letter, employer's letter stating the salary of the sponsor, or copies of financial awards. An I-20 or IAP-66 cannot be issued without this information. All information must be submitted in the original; absolutely no faxes or copies will be accepted. Students residing outside the United States at the time of application should keep copies or another set of original documents to present upon visa application. Students already in the United States should contact the Office of International Students about transferring student status to Fordham or changing status.

*Immunization Requirement*

In addition, proof of immunization against measles, mumps and Rubella must be provided upon arrival at Fordham University.
