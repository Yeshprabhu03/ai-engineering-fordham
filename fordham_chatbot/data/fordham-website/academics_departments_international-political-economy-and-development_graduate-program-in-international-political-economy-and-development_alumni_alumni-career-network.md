The IPED Alumni Career Network is published each August and mailed free of charge to all alumni who completed and returned their alumni survey whether or not they wish to have their names listed in the Network. The directory is also distributed free of charge to all recent graduates and currently matriculated students. Recent editions contains the names, postal addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers of alumni willing to give career advice in fields ranging from international banking and government service to work in the non-profit and academic sectors.
