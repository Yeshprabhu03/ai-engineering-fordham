The Graduate Program in International Political Economy and Development (IPED) offers a number of career placement services specifically designed for IPED students. Since we are a small program, we are able to give you the personal attention that you deserve.

- IPED Career Library: Located in Room E 540 of Dealy Hall, the IPED Career Library has a number of resources tailored especially for IPED students. There are career guides that focus on particular aspects of the private sector, the government sector, and the non-profit sector. With respect to the private sector, the library maintains up to date information on careers in banking, finance, and management consulting. With regard to the government sector the library is geared towards the US Executive Branch, the US Congress, and the United Nations. And our non-profit sector holdings focus primarily on international relief and development organizations. We also maintain up to date holdings on internships, cover letters, resumes, and interviewing.
- IPED Alumni Networking Directory: Each year the IPED Program produces a directory of alumni who are available for informational interviews regarding their professional careers. This directory is distributed at no cost to current students and recent graduates as well as to all alumni who complete our annual survey. Many have found it to be an invaluable resource in getting their job search started.
- Career Trips: Each fall semester the IPED Program sponsors career trips to the United Nations and to Washington, DC. Each spring semester we sponsor a career trip to Wall Street. Besides learning about exciting career opportunities, our students are able to network and to interact with many of our alumni.
- International Students Career Forum: Each fall semester, the IPED Program conducts a roundtable discussion for currently enrolled international students about finding jobs in the US, in their home countries, and overseas.
