Sean Cox (IPED ’13) is RPCV El Salvador. Through the Peace Corps Coverdell Fellowship, Sean pursued the MA IPED and MA Economics degrees at Fordham. After IPED, he was a Fulbright Clinton Public Policy Fellow and was placed in Guatemala. Currently, Sean works at the US Foreign Agricultural Service as a Foreign Service Officer.

The Peace Corps Coverdell Fellows Program at Fordham University is a graduate fellowship program that offers financial assistance to Returned Peace Corps Volunteers (RPCV) who wish to earn a Master's degree in International Political Economy and Development (IPED). In addition to their academic program, Peace Corps fellows will gain valuable on-the-job training in project management while interning with a community development organization in an underserved US community.

Fordham Peace Corps Coverdell Fellows may be selected to intern as an assistant financial project manager with the University Neighborhood Housing Program (UNHP). UNHP is a federally-designated local community financial development institution dedicated to the creation, preservation, and financing of affordable housing in the Bronx for immigrant and other low-income families. (More information about UNHP can be found on their [website](http://www.unhp.org/), [blog](https://unhp.tumblr.com/))

Our fellows may also be selected to intern as an assistant project manager with the Fordham Road Business Improvement District (Fordham BID). Fordham BID is a community organization primarily made up of local retailers who wish to promote business development and improve the quality of life along Fordham Road, a major retail street serving various immigrant and low-income communities in the Bronx. Fordham BID, established by local New York City law, is self-funded by local property owners and is overseen by the City's Department of Small Business Services. According to former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, "BIDs are a proven example of how public/private partnerships can promote economic development." More information about the Fordham BID can be found on their [website](http://www.fordhamroadbid.org/).

Finally, some fellows are selected to intern as an assistant project manager with Fordham Bedford Housing Corporation (FBHC). Tenant and community leaders formed FBHC in 1980 to prevent housing abandonment in many parts of the Bronx. Today, FBHC oversees the management of more than 110 apartment buildings with nearly 3500 units. FBHC is a community leader in providing housing that is safe, sound, and affordable. (More information about FBHC can be found on their [website](http://www.fordham-bedford.org/))

At a minimum, Fordham Peace Corps fellows will receive a full tuition scholarship.

- Be a Returned Peace Corps Volunteer who has satisfactorily completed his or her Peace Corps service;
