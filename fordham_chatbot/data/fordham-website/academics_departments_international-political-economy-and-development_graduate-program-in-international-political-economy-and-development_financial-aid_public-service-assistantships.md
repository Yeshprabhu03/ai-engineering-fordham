Brian Dutoi (IPED ’14) currently works at the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) as International Agricultural Program Specialist. During his time in IPED, he interned at the FAS country office in Kenya.

Public Service Assistantships are designed to attract into the IPED Program highly qualified applicants who have a strong interest in pursuing a career in international public service with the United States Government, other national governments, the United Nations, or other multilateral institutions. To be considered for a Public Service Assistantship you must:

- Indicate in your statement of purpose that prior to graduation, you will apply for a Young Professional Program to prepare for a career in international public service (i.e., U.S. Foreign Service Officer, U.S. Civil Service, U.S. Congressional Interns, U.N. Junior Professional Program, World Bank Junior Professional Associate Program, etc.), and


- Be willing to take a sufficient number of economics courses (seven in total) so that you can be rated as an international economist for employment with the US government.

In addition, awardees are expected to complete our sequence of Project Management courses in Project Accounting, Project Design, Project Proposal Development, and Project Monitoring and Evaluation.

Preferential consideration is given to applicants who have successfully served for two years as a volunteer with the U.S. Peace Corps or other similar organizations. Preferential consideration is also given to applicants who have served with the United States military especially those who have dealt with civilian affairs overseas. Recipients must be full-time students. An important purpose of these assistantships is to place individuals, who have a greater sensitivity and understanding of other cultures, into positions of leadership in the management of international programs.

These assistantships include a generous stipend combined with a full tuition scholarship. Awardees are expected to do a summer internship in the international public sector, preferably overseas at either a US Embassy or with the United Nations. Included with this assistantship is an additional stipend to cover the travel and living expenses of a summer internship.

To be considered for a Public Service Assistantship, you must submit a formal application including a statement of purpose, three letters of recommendation, general aptitude scores on the [Graduate Record Exam (GRE)](http://www.ets.org/gre), and transcripts of previous undergraduate and graduate course work. Your statement of purpose must state your willingness to pursue a post-graduate young professional program with either a national government or a multilateral institution. Applicants applying for a Public Service Assistantship cannot be considered for an Arrupe Fellowship or Global Markets Assistantship.

*IPED's Public Service Assistantship honors the memory of the Reverend John Courtney Murray, SJ. Father Murray, an American Jesuit, has been called the most important theologian produced by the US Catholic Church. He made significant contributions to American political philosophy and the moral evaluation of public policy in a democratic and pluralistic society.*
