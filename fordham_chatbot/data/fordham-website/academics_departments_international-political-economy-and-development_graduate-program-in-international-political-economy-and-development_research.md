The IPED graduate program spearheads research and conferences in the realm of global economic relations and international development. These initiatives provide an avenue for students to collaborate and enhance their research skills and contribute to existing literature. Students are given the opportunity to engage in the discourse beyond the classroom with leading scholars and development practitioners, becoming active contributors in the current dialogue.
