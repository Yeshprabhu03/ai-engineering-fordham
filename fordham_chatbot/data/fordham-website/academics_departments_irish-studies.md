Fordham University is home to the first Irish Studies program in the United States, and our connections with Ireland are many and longstanding. The Institute of Irish Studies is dedicated to offering courses that explore all aspects of Irish culture and identity. Literary, history, Catholic Studies, and political science, all inform our holistic approach to Irish Studies.

The Institute of Irish Studies offers an interdisciplinary minor designed to pair well with a variety of majors. Students are allowed to tailor their emphasis to their own interests, picking from a variety of classes. Students interested in the minor should visit our [Minor](/academics/departments/irish-studies/minor-in-irish-studies/) page.

Additionally, the Institute of Irish Studies promotes Irish cultural events on campus, keeping Fordham’s Irish heritage alive. Working with student groups and scholars alike, we regularly host academic conferences and lectures.
