# Irish Community in NYC

The Irish community in New York is among the most active, thriving populations in this multicultural city. Irish civic organizations are scattered throughout the tri-state area, from the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, to the Mayo Society of the City of New York. Numerous theater companies stage works by Irish writers, while musicians are never at a loss for a place to perform. Here you can find links to various Irish cultural groups and information on their activities.
