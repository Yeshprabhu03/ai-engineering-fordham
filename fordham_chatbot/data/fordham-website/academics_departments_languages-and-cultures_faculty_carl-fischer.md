Carl Fischer specializes in modern and contemporary Latin American literature, visual and film studies, queer studies, and cultural studies, with an emphasis on Chile and the Southern Cone. His scholarly research agenda approaches two primary preoccupations: on one hand, the proliferation of authoritarian, racist, and neoliberal discourses seeking to shape bodies, colonize territories, and impose normative and nationalistic ideals; and on the other, the vibrant spread of queer, trans, feminist, indigenous, and otherwise dissident cultures that defy authoritarianism.

His first monograph,

*Queering the Chilean Way: Cultures of Exceptionalism and Sexual Dissidence, 1965-2015*, was published in 2016 with Palgrave MacMillan Press.*Queering the Chilean Way*examines and critiques Chile’s official claims to economic exceptionalism, by putting forth an artistic, literary, and cinematic archive of queer figures who disrupted authoritarian narratives that narrowly imagined heterosexual men to embody the*modelo*, a metonym in Chilean Spanish for the country’s “exceptional” economy. The book examines authors and filmmakers such as José Donoso, Miguel Littín, Diamela Eltit, and Pedro Lemebel, to shed light on the sexual, economic, and aesthetic dimensions of Chilean exceptionalism—at its heart, a discourse of exclusion. In 2024, this monograph was translated into Spanish by Camila Matta and published in Chile by Ediciones Universidad Alberto Hurtado as*Locas excepciones: La vía chilena a la disidencia sexual*.The volume

*Chilean Cinema in the Twenty-First-Century World*, which he co-edited with Vania Barraza, was published in 2020 with Wayne State University Press. It collects fourteen articles from US- and Chile-based scholars exploring the choices made by Chilean auteurs to render their films—which often deal with very local domestic issues—intelligible to broader global audiences.He has co-edited two academic dossiers: "Estéticas del autoritarismo latinoamericano," along with Benjamin Loy in

*Revista Iberoamericana*(2025), explores representations of authoritarian aesthetics in 20th-century Latin American literature and culture. "Representaciones del caso de Colonia Dignidad en la producción cultural chilena reciente," along with María Angélica Franken in*Anales de Literatura Chilena*(2023), focuses on the growing corpus of cultural production that has recently appeared about Colonia Dignidad, an autarchic, authoritarian enclave populated by Germans in a remote part of southern Chile.His second book project,

*Cosmic Racisms: Geopolitics and Fascist Aesthetics in Latin America’s Southern Cone*, argues that authoritarianism in Argentina, Chile, and Paraguay hinges upon the aestheticization of peripheral territories as deserted, yet seductive, spaces into which states can expand their sovereignty. This project argues that from the 1870s through the 1980s, proto-fascist or fascist state discourses imagine the Falkland Islands, Patagonia, the Chaco region, the Atacama Desert, Easter Island, and Antarctica as utopian sites onto which they could project discourses of racism, state-sponsored genocide, antisemitism, normative masculinity, colonialism, and paranoid conspiracy theories. It thus examines how authoritarian and anti-authoritarian thinkers—starting with Gabriela Mistral, Leopoldo Lugones, and Natalicio González, who were influenced by José Vasconcelos (author of*The Cosmic Race*), and then moving on to Augusto Roa Bastos, Jorge Luis Borges, Paz Encina, Roberto Bolaño, Adriana Lestido, and Lola Larra, among others—negotiate those discourses.He is also a translator, having worked in that capacity for the government of Chile prior to his PhD. Along with Catherine Brix, Michael Lazzara, and Sowmya Ramanathan, he co-translated a series of essays by Diamela Eltit, entitled
