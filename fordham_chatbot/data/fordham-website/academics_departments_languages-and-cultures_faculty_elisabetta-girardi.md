After earning her J.D. degree at the University of Turin (Italy), specializing in International Law, Elisabetta worked at the university’s Business School Study Abroad Program and in a public institution as an expert in European Union Communication Strategy and Policies. Before moving to New York, she lived in Baltimore, MD, where she taught Italian Language and Culture for ten years at Goucher College, Towson University, and Loyola College of Maryland. Since joining the LACU Department at Fordham in the fall of 2021, she has been teaching Italian 1001-level courses and IT2001 – Language and Literature.

Elisabetta’s background in human rights and her past work experiences have given her unique insight into the world of cross-cultural exchange and second language instruction. She combines this expertise with innovative teaching methods, including visual and verbal strategies, to provide students with a broader understanding of Italian history, culture, and literature.
