# Languages and Cultures Study Abroad Opportunities

*“Never hesitate to go far away, beyond all seas, all frontiers, all countries, all beliefs”*

Amin Maalouf, *Leo Africanus*)

Study abroad is an integral part of the study of foreign language and literature, and students are highly encouraged to study in a non-English-speaking country for a summer, a semester, or a year.

**Fordham Athenaeum in Rome (Summer)**

Experience the classic and modern lure of Italy’s capital city. The program offers art history and photography classes, and “Performing Italian,” a team-taught course by a professor of Italian and a professor of Theatre.

In addition to the programs in Rome, Fordham offers a broad variety of study abroad options in Europe (including Austria, France, Germany, Italy), Africa, the Far East, Latin America, and the Middle East. For more information about studying abroad worldwide and the application process, visit the [Study Abroad office](https://www.fordham.edu/info/20917/study_abroad).

**Attention**: Students who opt to apply study abroad credits toward their foreign language major or minor must have their courses approved by their major or minor language adviser prior to their going abroad.
