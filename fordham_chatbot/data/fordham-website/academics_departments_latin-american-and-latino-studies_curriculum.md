# LALSI Curriculum

## Undergraduate Program

The undergraduate major is ideal for students interested in Latin America and Latino issues who want to craft their own individualized major. The major draws on a range of courses from a wide variety of disciplines. Students can find mentors among the Latin American and Latino Studies Institute’s dedicated faculty and have an option of writing a senior thesis under their guidance. LALSI majors have gone on to law school, graduate school, careers in finance, transportation, teaching and social service. For more information on LALSI alumni, visit our alumni page.

LALSI offers an undergraduate major and minor at both Lincoln Center and Rose Hill campuses. Many students also choose Latin American and Latino Studies as part of a double major.
