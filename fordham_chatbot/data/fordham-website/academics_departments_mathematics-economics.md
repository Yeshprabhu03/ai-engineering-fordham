Offered jointly by the [Economics](/academics/departments/economics/) and [Mathematics](/academics/departments/mathematics/) Department, this major provides student with a strong background in economic analysis as well the mathematics widely used in modern economics and finance.

The Math and Quantitative Economics major is also excellent preparation for Law, MBA, and other graduate social science and health programs that employ math and quantitative methods. It’s demanding courses and emphasis on quantitative methods also makes it attractive to business and financial industry recruiters.
