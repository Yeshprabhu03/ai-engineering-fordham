## About the Math Help Rooms

The Mathematics Department operates Math Help Rooms at Rose Hill and Lincoln Center. They are staffed by instructors and student tutors. Fordham students with math questions may drop in anytime the rooms are staffed to ask the tutors questions. **No appointment needed.**

Do you need help in math? Our professors are here to help you!
