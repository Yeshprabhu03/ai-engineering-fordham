# Medieval Studies Reading Groups

Faculty and graduate students at the Center for Medieval Studies have run reading groups for a wide array of languages including medieval Latin, Old French, and Old English. The languages offered vary from semester to semester according to interest. Readers with all levels of experience are welcome. The Fordham Reads Dante Initiative is sponsored by the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures, the Center for Medieval Studies, and the Curran Center for American Catholic Studies.
