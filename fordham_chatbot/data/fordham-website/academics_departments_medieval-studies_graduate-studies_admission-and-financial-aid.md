### Application Guidelines

Requirements for admission to the MA program are those of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences: a bachelor's degree from an accredited American or foreign university; the Graduate Record Examination (General Aptitude Test); and, for foreign students, an English proficiency examination such as TOEFL. [Instructions on the application process](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/admissions/) are on the Graduate School page.

Applicants to the MA program in Medieval Studies need to fill out an [online application](https://gradadmissions.fordham.edu/apply/).

The application deadline for Fall 2025 admission with GSAS funding consideration is **January 3, 2025.**

### Graduate Financial Aid

Graduate assistantships and fellowships are available to all applicants to graduate departments on a merit basis. **Several of these graduate assistantships are specifically reserved for first year students in the Medieval Studies master's program.** These graduate assistantships include the tuition for 30 credit hours of coursework, a stipend towards health insurance and a stipend for nine months (currently $25,164), in return for working for the Center for Medieval Studies or another academic unit for around 18 hours a week. University, Loyola and Bennet Fellowships, awarded on a merit basis to incoming students, include higher stipends. PhD students enrolled in the doctoral-level Advanced Certificate program are also eligible to apply for a Senior Teaching Fellowship, which provides an additional year of funding.

Graduate students in Medieval Studies are encouraged to apply for [research and travel grants](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/financial-support/graduate-student-support-grant/) through GSAS. The Graduate Student Association also offers the [Professional Development Grant](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/student-resources/graduate-student-council/funding/) each semester.

The GSAS also offers Summer Assistantships on a competitive basis.
