Fordham students arrive in Spain to walk the Camino

with Dr. Richard Gyug (León, 2011).

The Center for Medieval Studies serves as an umbrella organization for all medievalists on campus, which include in any one year, thirty to forty PhD students in one of our associated doctoral departments (Classics, English, History, Philosophy, and Theology). The rich variety of medieval topics pursued by these doctoral students is evident in the list of completed PhD dissertations below. Those who have also completed a Medieval Studies Doctoral Certificate are noted with an asterisk.(*****)
