This is a course in the theory and practice of editing, especially as it relates to medieval texts, with most of the examples coming from Middle English. We'll give attention to documentary, historical, and aesthetic approaches, and we will spend some time exploring digital methods and concerns. Four-credit courses that meet for 150 minutes per week require three additional hours of class preparation per week on the part of the student in lieu of an additional hour of formal instruction.**THEO 6192 R00 (3)****The Greco-Roman Context of Christianity**| McGowan

R 9:00 - 11:30 | CRN 51544

This course creates a context for understanding the encounter of early Christianity with Greco-Roman culture by exploring Hellenistic and Roman history, politics, religion, social relations, economics, education, rhetoric, philosophy, literature, and the theatre.**HIST 7110 R01 (4)****Proseminar: Medieval Political Cultures**| Paul

T 2:30 - 5:00 | CRN 51538

This course, the first part of a two-semester proseminar/seminar sequence, will introduce students to recent debates and different approaches to cultures of power and political processes in Western Europe in the central Middle Ages. Among the many topics we might consider are lordship, status and authority, political assembly and consultation, courtliness and persuasion, rulership and sanctity, and the rise of accountability. Students will become familiar with a wide range of source material, from diplomatic and documentary collections to historical narratives and courtly literature. With this solid foundation in the current historiography and available research tools, students will be expected to identify a suitable topic for a sustained research project. Completing this project will be the objective of the seminar course to be offered in the Spring.

T 11:30 - 2:00 | CRN 52098What did it feel like to hammer nails into Jesus’s hands or to intone judgements at doomsday or to dance with the deadly sins on an open-air stage in the late Middle Ages? How far can we go in reconstructing, practicing, and sharing medieval performance styles today? What kind of knowledge might the evidence of our own bodies afford us in support of our study of the medieval past? In this course, we will tug at this knot of questions through careful reading, writing, discussion, and experimentation across an uncommon collection of sources, including medieval English playtexts and documents; scholarship on medieval drama and its reenactment; theoretical texts in performance studies, theater-making, and embodied technique; and the witness of our own embodied and reflective experience. Relevant research areas include medieval drama, history of the body, history of experience, history of spirituality, critical temporality studies, non-discursive epistemology, affect studies. Primary source readings will include much of the corpus of surviving Middle English drama supplemented by the Records of Early English Drama project; further readings include Sharon Aronson-Lehavi, Augusto Boal, Rob Boddice, Jerzy Grotowski, Andre Lepecki, Lauren Mancia, Mary Overlie, Rebecca Schneider, Matthew Sergi, Mark Smith, Ben Spatz, and others. Course assignments will center close reading, scholarly research, and academic writing, with options for digital humanities and performance-driven research, undertaken independently or collaboratively. Students may also opt into a parallel laboratory in Mary Overlie’s Six Viewpoints and/or a public performance of medieval drama at the Cloisters Museum in spring 2026. While helpful, no prior knowledge of Middle English or Latin is expected or required.

Medieval and Renaissance Europeans had a sophisticated, pre-modern understanding of the world and universe around them, from the canyons to the stars. This seminar explores the cosmos as seen from the perspective of Renaissance peoples, moving from the depths of inner earth to the heavens and exploring the creatures that dwelt there, from angels to demons, as well as the connections that bound them and the universe together. In this universe, religion, magic, and science coexisted uneasily and interacted constantly. A central topic will be the decay of this cosmos and its replacement by a universe more familiar to modern peoples.

**Spring 2024****MVST 5400 R01 (4)****Courtly Culture**| Hafner, Paul

W 2:30 - 5:00 | CRN 49655

Courts, as spaces of political power, intellectual activity, and social influence, have long been a focus of both scholarly inquiry and the popular presentation of the medieval world. Courts across medieval Afro-Eurasia shared literary traditions and cultural forms, exchanging and adapting songs, stories, objects, fashions, and ideas. This course will address some of the central themes of scholarly inquiry into courtly culture including the phenomenon of courtly love, debates about the “civilizing process” of courtly manners, and the evolution and diffusion of courtly themes and literary forms. The course will also evaluate the potential for the study of courtly culture to reshape the field of medieval studies and the wider understanding of the Middle Ages as interconnected, diverse, and truly global. Note: Four-credit courses that meet for 150 minutes per week require three additional hours of class preparation per week on the part of the student in lieu of an additional hour of formal instruction.**HIST 5203 R01 (4)****Medieval Hagiography**| Bruce

Drawing on the diversity of expertise among Fordham’s faculty and the rich resources of New York City, the course will introduce students to a variety of handwritten sources (including manuscripts and other documents), as well as coins and seals, and the specialized skills used to understand and interpret these sources. The course will also feature discussions of the processes whereby libraries and archives were developed and maintained, and how scholars use these sources in the digital era. Note: Four-credit courses that meet for 150 minutes per week require three additional hours of class preparation per week on the part of the student in lieu of an additional hour of formal instruction.**HIST****6077****(4)****The Angevin Empire****I**| Paul

R 2:30-5:00 | CRN: 51537

From the Middle of the twelfth until the first quarter of the thirteenth centuries, one dynasty, the house of Anjou, were the effective rulers of an enormous agglomeration of kingdoms and principalities which stretched from the North Sea to the Mediterranean and encompassed England, large parts of Ireland, Wales, and nearly half of the territory which today constitutes modern France. Following a wave of renewed scholarly interest in the politics and culture of this period, this class will explore this short-lived but powerful empire, its lands, peoples and rulers. Together we will explore the lives of dynamic individuals within the Angevin court; Angevin court culture, the governance of a medieval "empire"; dynastic politics and diplomacy; the Third Crusade; and England and France after the loss of Normandy.

Topics will include faith and reason, divine ideas, time, eternity, and creations, the theology of the Holy Trinity, the nature of the soul, the freedom of the will and divine predestination, good and evil, original sin and divine grace, and the human history as the history of salvation. The unifying theme of the discussion will be a synthetic account of St. Augustine's Neoplatonic Christian anthropology, occasionally contrasted with St. Thomas Aquinas' Aristotelian Christian anthropology. The discussion will be organized around student presentations and two term papers on topics other than one's presentation topics.**ENGL 6235 (3)****Medieval Travel Narratives**| Yeager

T 11:30-2:00 | CRN: 52098

Some of the most engaging questions about the Middle Ages have to do with the narratives of cultures in contact. Join me and other scholars who work on the medieval travel genre, finding in its discourses productive sites for exploration of premodern race, gender, religion, and more. This course will focus on a range of traditions, including crusade romances, such as "Richard, Coeur de Lion" in light of contemporary chronicler, Roger of Howden’s, "Chronica." Pilgrim and merchant narratives, from Egeria to Margery Kempe, and Mandeville to Marco Polo, will provide a contrast to romance and chronicle modes.

This seminar is intended to familiarize graduate students with current themes and trends in medieval environmental history. Weekly reading assignments comprise historical monographs and scholarly articles in English.**MVST 5311 (4) Arthurian Literature**| Hafner

Session II, TR 1:00-4:00 | CRN: 15053

This seminar will provide an overview of Arthurian romance themes and adaptations in Europe. Chrétien de Troyes may not have written the very first chivalric romance, but he was the pioneer who defined the genre and created the texts which would set the standard for centuries to come. The central role which Chrétien’s œuvre occupied in the French-speaking world is reflected in a wave of adaptations into many other vernacular languages, set off almost instantly and covering all of medieval Europe. In this class, we will focus on three literary traditions: the Yvain, Tristan, and Perceval stories in their early Old French versions as well as their Middle High German, Middle English, and Old Norse adaptations. The degree to which these translations try to recreate their sources’ original content varies greatly and is determined by a nexus of cultural, political, and social factors which we will examine in some detail. Students are expected to read the Middle English versions in well-annotated editions. All other texts can be prepared in English translation while some of the class time will be dedicated to closely reading some crucial passages in the original vernacular languages. Additional texts in other languages (Italian, Latin), in post-medieval renditions (e.g., T.S. Eliot’s "Wasteland" or Richard Wagner’s "Parsifal"), other media (films, opera, musicals), and material culture (frescoes, tapestries, book illuminations, etc) will be determined based on the interest of the seminar participants. In addition, we will make use of the rich resources New York City has to offer and explore some of the spectacular Arthurian artifacts housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Cloisters, and the J. P. Morgan Museum and Library—online if necessary, on site if possible.**LATN 5090 (0) Latin for Reading |**McGowan

**ENGL 5203 (3) The Postcolonial Middle Ages**| Yeager

T 11:00-1:30 | CRN: 50690

Postcolonial study has been a productive scholarly approach for decades. The accuracy of the term, “postcolonial,” with reference to premodern literature, has been an ongoing subject of debate. According to accepted, critical definitions, postcolonial literatures are products of colonizing communities and previously colonized cultures, rising in the wake of periods of industrial colonization; moreover, postcolonial study has been linked to modern European communities which formed global empires. These expectations and others have made the “postcolonial” Middle Ages appear controversial. In spite of these controversies, productive understanding of premodern culture has emerged from research under the postcolonial lens, encouraging the study of diverse premodern cultures, displaced or subjugated voices within the medieval period, the production and performance of identity, and the ways in which communities define, remember, and perpetuate themselves. This course is global in its scope, and will focus on medieval texts produced in Africa, Asia, England, France, and the Levant under changing premodern regimes, and will explore the varied literary responses to colonization, diaspora, and displacement that occurred long before the Age of Empire.**GERM 5001 (0) Graduate Reading for German I**| Hafner

M 2:30-5:00 | CRN: 50106

This course charts the social, political, and cultural history of the feudal principalities that were established by Latin Christians in the Eastern Mediterranean in the wake of the First Crusade. Students will be introduced to the narrative and documentary sources through which the history of the Latin Kingdom has been constructed, as well as the archaeology and art of the Levant during the period of Frankish occupation and settlement. In addition, we will engage with the major historiographical debates concerning the constitutional organization of the Latin kingdom, the relationship between the Frankish crusaders and Muslim and eastern Christian populations over whom they ruled, and the "colonial" character of the Latin settlements. Note: Four-credit courses that meet for 150 minutes per week require three additional hours of class preparation per week on the part of the student in lieu of an additional hour of formal instruction.**HIST 7024 (4) Proseminar: Making Money in the Middle Ages**| Comuzzi

F 2:30-5:00 | CRN: 50107

This is the first half of a two-semester proseminar/seminar course in which graduate students will formulate and produce original (article or M.A.-thesis length) research projects that touch on medieval social and economic history. Topics discussed may include coinage and money, commerce and trade, merchants and artisans, labor, credit, religious and cultural attitudes to usury and profit, wealth and poverty, social mobility, and overall economic development during the European middle ages. In this proseminar, we will read and discuss relevant works, while students work on formulating and laying the groundwork for their research projects. Note: Four-credit courses that meet for 150 minutes per week require three additional hours of class preparation per week on the part of the student in lieu of an additional hour of formal instruction.**MVST 5077 (4) Editing Medieval Texts**| Reilly

W 2:30-5:00 | CRN: 50096

This is a course in the theory and practice of editing, especially as it relates to medieval texts, with most of the examples coming from Middle English. We'll give attention to documentary, historical, and aesthetic approaches, and we will spend some time exploring digital methods and concerns.**PHIL 5012 (3) Introduction to St. Augustine**| Klima

F 12:00-2:00 | CRN: 48104

This seminar provides a systematic survey of the main themes of St. Augustine's philosophy and theology. Topics will include faith and reason, divine ideas, time, eternity, and creations, the theology of the Holy Trinity, the nature of the soul, the freedom of the will and divine predestination, good and evil, original sin and divine grace, and the human history as the history of salvation. The unifying theme of the discussion will be a synthetic account of St. Augustine's Neoplatonic Christian anthropology, occasionally contrasted with St. Thomas Aquinas' Aristotelian Christian anthropology. The discussion will be organized around student presentations and two term papers on topics other than one's presentation topics.**THEO 5075 (3) Syriac Language and Literature I**| Fiano

T 4:00-6:30 | CRN: 49791

This course is the first of a two-semester introduction to Syriac, a dialect belonging to the Aramaic language branch. The first semester will introduce the Estrangela and the Serto scripts, cover grammatical foundations, and expose students from early on to the reading of texts. The second semester will be mostly spent reading Syriac literature, but some time will be devoted to select special topics in Syriac grammar.**THEO 6192 (3) The Greco-Roman Context of Early Christianity**| Welborn

T 9:00-11:30 | CRN: 49793

This course creates a context for understanding the encounter of early Christianity with Greco-Roman culture by exploring Hellenistic and Roman history, politics, religion, social relations, economics, education, rhetoric, philosophy, literature, and the theatre.**THEO 6661 (3) Ritual Contexts of the New Testament**| Peppard

W 9:00-11:30 | CRN: 49792 -
**ENGL 511 (3) Race, Religion, and Monstrosity**| Yeager

The medieval taste for the exotic has introduced may audiences to a range of monstrous beings, from ferocious giants and dog-headed men to the peace-loving sciapod. Medieval studies of monstrosity have often been linked solely to theorize the different human "races" found there. Yet the medievael language of monstrosity was not always liited to travel narrative, nor to the pejorative, for it was used ot describe heroes, saints, even the Christian deity in far more familiar contexts than many would imagine. In this course we will examine the discourse of monsrosity as a complex critical lens through which premodern writers asked important questions of race, religion, civic virtue, and human morality. We will read from Pliny, Augustine, the Beowulf Manuscript, medieval romance, and Mandeville's account.**HIST 6077 (4) Angevin Empire |**Paul

From the middle of the twelfth- untill the first quarter of the thirteenth centuries, one dynasty, the house of Anjou, were the effective rulers of an enormous agglomeration of kingdoms and principalities which stretched from the North Sea to the Mediterranean and encompassed England, large parts of Ireland, Wales, and nearly half of the territory which today constitutes modern France. Following a wave of renewed scholarly interest in the politics and culture of this period, this class will explore this short-lived but powerful empire, its lands, peoples and rulers. Together we will explore the lives of dynamic individuals within the Angevin court; Angevin court culture, the governance of a medieval "empire"; dynastic politics and diplomacy; the Third Crusade; and England and France after the loss of Normandy.**HIST 7026 (4) Classics in the Middle Ages |**Bruce

This seminar deals primarily with the transmission and reception in western Europe of classical Greek and Latin texts written before 525 CE, with a focus on the Latin tradition. The overarching aim of the seminar is to highlight the achievement of the Latin Middle Ages in preserving the ancient classics and appropriating them for new uses in a Christian civilization. It treats the most influential authors in the medieval schools (Virgil, Horace, and Ovid), as well as the persistence of the most prominent genres of classical literature, including didactic poetry, drama, elegy, encyclopedic works, epic poetry, epigram, grammatical works, historical writings, legal works, literary criticism, lyric poetry, oratory, philosophical writings, prose fiction, and satire. Lastly, the seminar also considers centers of transmission, book collections, and the medieval commentary tradition.**MVST 5071 (4) Archives & Materials |**Comuzzi

This course will introduce students to many of the most important sources for the study of the medieval world. Drawing on the diversity of expertise among Fordham's faculty and the rich resources of New York City, the course will introduce students to a variety of handwritten sources (including manuscripts and other documents), as well as coins and seals, and the specialized skills used to understand and interpret these sources. The course will also feature discussions of the processes whereby libraries and archives were developed and maintained, and how scholars use these sources in the digital era.**PHIL 5012 (3) Introduction to Augustine |**Cullen

This seminaro provides a systematic survey of the main themes of St. Augustine's philosophy and theology. Topics will include faith and reason, divine ideas, time, eternity, and creations, the theology of the Holy Trinity, the nature of the soul, the freedom of hte will and divine predestination, good and evil, original sin and divine grace, and the human history as the history of salvation. The unifying theme of the discussion will be a synthetic account of St. Augustine's Neoplatonic Christian anthropology, occasionally contrasted with St. Thomas Aquinas' Aristotelian Christian anthropology. The discussion will be organized aorund student presentations and two term papers on topics other than one's presentation topics.**THEO 6014 (3) Ancient Theological Controversies |**Fiano

This course will aim at providing students with a historical understanding of the ancient development of Trinitarian and Christological doctrine while also reflecting on the ancient and modern historiographic constructions of the controversies that surrounded those topics through theoretical and methodological readings in intellectual history, the sociology of scientific knowledge, and discourse analysis. After a syrvey of some early understandings of Christ's identity and of crucial early disputes, the seminar will focus on the Trinitarian, Christological, and anthropomorphic controversies. Emphasis will be placed on the philosophical underpinnings of the various theological postures, on the late ancient emergence of theological discourse as a field of knowledge sustained by a new set of intellectual practices, and on the link between theological debates and imperial power. Whenever possible, particular attention will be devoted to Syriac and Coptic sources for the controversies under examination. -
**Summer 2022****HIST 5204 (4) Medieval Environmental History |**Bruce

This seminar is intended to familiarize graduate students with current themes and trends in medieval environmental history. Weekly reading assignments comprise historical monographs and scholarly articles in English. Four-credit courses that meet for 150 minutes per week require three additional hours of class preparation per week on the part of the student in lieu of an additional hour of formal instruction**LAT 5090 (0) Latin For Reading |**McGowan

A course designed for graduate students seeking a reading knowledge of Latin in their discipline. Some prior study of Latin is desirable but not necessary.**LAT 5093 (3) Ecclesiastical Reading |**McGowan

A study of the grammatical structure, form, and vocabulary of Church Latin, focussing on the Bible, the Church Fathers, and medieval thinkers.**MVST 5013 (3) Reading Richard Rolle's World |**Albin

Richard Rolle of Hampole was perhaps the most influential and widely read English author of the late Middle Ages. Exceeded in testamentary bequests only by biblical and liturgical books, Rolle’s writings exercised immense influence over the literary, mystical, and devotional cultures of late medieval and early modern England. The hermit penned meditations on Christ’s passion, lyrics that would shape devotional poetry for a generation, popular books of instruction for female religious, an English translation and commentary on the Psalter, and experimental Latin prose works teetering on alliterative chaos. His corpus captures the devotional spirit of fourteenth-century England. In this interdisciplinary seminar, we will survey Rolle’s writings and explore their literary, theological, affective, heremeneutic, and theoretical innovations. We will also glance backwards at the sources from which Rolle draws, and forwards to his impact on future authors of spiritual literatures.

**Spring 2022****ENGL 5121 (3) Medieval Paleography |**Gyug

Reading handwritten sources—records, chronicles, treatises, Bibles, works of literature, and many other genres and types—is fundamental for primary source research, especially in premodern periods, and for understanding the basis for many secondary works. In this course, we will develop our ability to decipher and understand handwritten sources by considering the history of medieval handwriting. Weekly exercises will ask students to transcribe (not translate!) medieval sources from a range of genres, in Latin and European vernaculars. No prior knowledge of Latin or medieval vernaculars is required or assumed. We will consider the purposes, preparation, transmission, and preservation of the materials contained in each type of source, with an emphasis on the use of these sources in our scholarship and the tools important for their study.**HIST 5203 (4) Medieval Hagiography |**Bruce

This research seminar introduces students to the challenges and pitfalls of using saints' lives and other hagiographical writings (miracula, furta sacra, etc.) as sources for medieval history. It aims to familiarize students with competing historical approaches to these genres and to provide a practical guide to the scholarly resources necessary to exploit them as historical sources.**GERM 5002 (0) Graduate Reading in German II |**Hafner

Second semester of the not for credit German reading course.**HIST 8110 (4) PSM: Church Law and Medieval Society |**Mueller

This course will consist of a two-semester proseminar/seminar sequence inviting graduate students to formulate and conduct original research projects in the field of medieval church law.**MVST 6225 (4) Old French in the Medieval World: Language Contact, Conquest, and Difference | O’Donnell & Reilly**

This interdisciplinary course offers an introduction to the cultural history of French language and literature during the Middle Ages. Before it was the national language of France, French was a language of empires in England, Italy, Cyprus, and Greece; a tongue of invaders and reformers; and an idiom spread by immigrants, scholars, merchants, sailors, artisans, poets, and romancers. We will explore the diversity of old French, its connections to political power and ideologies, its manuscript contexts, and its contact with other medieval languages and works of literature, such as Arabic, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, old English, middle Welsh, and old Occitan. In addition to interdisciplinary seminar topics and readings, weekly language instruction and fully supported readings from Chrétien de Troyes's "Story of the Grail" will allow students to gain competence in a primary language for research at the graduate level in several disciplines and perhaps the key to eternal life. Previous experience of old French is not expected; basic reading or speaking of modern French is not required but may be helpful; experience with other older languages is welcome.**THEO 6026 (3) Ancient Judaism |**Hogan

This course provides a survey of the literature and history of both Palestinian and Diaspora Judaism, including late biblical texts, apocrypha, pseudepigrapha, the Qumran Scrolls, Philo, and Josephus.**THEO 5230 (3) Advanced Greek: Early Christian Responses to Empire | Peppard**

This course includes both a rapid review of Greek grammar and syntax, and also intermediate/advanced readings from Hellenistic and/or early Christian texts.**PHIL 5209 (3) Ancient Philosophy |**Tress

This course studies major figures at the foundation of Western philosophy, reflecting on the questions the philosophers posed and the teachings they developed in response. Pre-Socratics, Plato, Socrates and Aristotle, as well as Stoics and Epicureans are among those to be examined. There will be opportunities to connect the ideas of Greek and Roman antiquity with early Eastern philosophies as well as later Western philosophies. -
**MVST 5070 (4) Manuscript Cultures |**HafnerIntroduction to principles, materials, and study of medieval manuscripts and primary documents as well as to problems of evaluation of the cultural contexts of their production and use. Ancillary topics will include manuscript illumination, the resources of codicology and paleography, the preparation and evaluation of modern editions, the assessment of readership and patronage, material philogy and the materialism of the middle ages, the development of libraries. Students will do hands-on work with primary sources at the Morgan Library, the rare book collection of the New York Public Library, and the rare books and manuscripts collection in Walsh Library. Final projects will be tailored to the students' primary research areas and expertise.**ENGL 5203 (3) English Postcolonial Middle Ages |**YeagerThis course addresses the multiplicity of ways in which postcolonial theory can be used to illuminate premodern texts. Texts to be read in Middle English include "Croxton Play of the Sacrament," Geoffrey Chaucer's "Man of Law's Tale" and "Prioress's Tale," among others, along with medieval texts in translation, such as "The Letter of Prester John," and the Beauvais "Play of Daniel." These works offer complex views of alterity, conquest, place, space, and performance, which are foundational in discussing how the Middle Ages can be viewed as postcolonial.

**HIST 6078 (4) Crusader States: The Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem 1099-1291 |**PaulThis course charts the social, political, and cultural history of the feudal principalities that were established by Latin Christians in the Eastern Mediterranean in the wake of the First Crusade. Students will be introduced to the narrative and documentary sources through which the history of the Latin Kingdom has been constructed, as well as the archaeology and art of the Levant during the period of Frankish occupation and settlement. In addition, we will engage with the major historiographical debates concerning the constitutional organziation of the Latin kingdom, the relationship between the Frankish crusaders and Muslim and eastern Christian populations over whom they ruled, and the colonial character of the Latin settlements.**HIST 7110 (4) PSM: Church Law and Medieval Society |**MuellerThis course will consist of a two-semester proseminar/seminar sequence inviting graduate students to formulate and conduct original research projects in the field of medieval church law.**PHIL 7039 (3) Aquinas's Philosophy of God |**DaviesThis course is devoted to explaining and commenting on Aquinas's philosophy of God and presented in texts such as his Summa Contra Gentiles, his Summa Theologiae, and his De Potentia.**THEO 6465 (3) Aseticism and Monasticism |**GuardadoThe course begins with a consideration of asceticism in Judaism, among pagans, and in early Christianity, including dedicated virginity, and then treats the history of the monastic movement up to the Carolingian era and Benedict of Aniane. The principal work of the course is reading and analyzing, in English translation, pertinent documents from this period, from four categories: lives of monks (Antony, Pachomius, Martin, Benedict), collected lives (Lausiac History, History of the Monks in Egypt, and others), rules (Basil, Augustine, the Master, Benedict), and theory (Evagrius of Pontus, John Cassian). Class reports and a substantial term paper are part of the course. -
#### Spring 2021

**HIST 6135 (4) Medieval Conflict & Peacemaking |**Mueller

In the Early Middle Ages (500-1050), judges presiding over courts in the modern sense of the word did not exist in the Latin West. Written laws were not implemented from above, and disputes involved feuding and voluntary forms of mediation. The facts of a case were investigated not through painstaking reconstruction of the incriminating event, but rather by way of collective oaths and duels. Another type of proof was the hot-iron ordeal, in which defendants placed their hand in a pot of boiling water to have guilt or innocence determined by the healing process. The course will provide a forum for the discussion of recent historiography on the subject. It will explore what it was that made these forms of peaceful conflict resolution ‘rational’ and reasonable in the eyes of contemporaries. Fundamental change occurred in the later Middle Ages when new groups in society started to oppose feuding and ordeals, increasingly limiting their use to nobles living in the countryside.**HIST 8056 (4) PSM: Medieval Political Cultures |**Paul

In the Spring semester component of the seminar sequence, students work on final projects based on topics identified in the Fall. These projects are intended to be sustained, original research papers of publishable quality. Class meetings will be devoted to honing research, writing, and presentation skills. All aspects of the writing process will be discussed, and students will have opportunities to read and critique each other’s writing. The course will conclude with a mini-conference allowing students to present their work before an audience of other scholars.**MLAL 5002 (0) Graduate Reading in German II |**Hafner**MVST 5050 (4) World of Late Antiquity: Introduction to History, Art, and Culture |**Sogno

This course offers an introduction to the history, art and culture of the Late Antique world from the third to the sixth century. We will explore the older narratives of decline in this period alongside powerful alternatives proposed by scholars more recently, drawing on both primary sources and monuments and critically examining the secondary literature that studies them.**PHIL 7012 (3) Plato’s Dialogues |**Miller

By most counts, Plato wrote 28 dialogues that are recognized as genuine. These dialogues vary greatly in length, content, and approximate time of composition. Most people, including philosophers, have an acquaintance with only a few of these dialogues, for instance, the Phaedo, Meno, Apology, and Republic, all of which probably belong to one period of Plato’s writing. An accurate understanding of Plato’s philosophy must be based on the study of his entire philosophical corpus. This might be said of any philosopher, but Plato is unique because he never reveals what his own philosophical commitments are. We need all the help we can get to understand him. It would be impossible to study all 28 dialogues in one semester. The Laws, for instance, are 339 tedious Stephanus pages long. It is assumed that some dialogues are familiar to students. The course will therefore cover as many unfamiliar but nevertheless important dialogues as possible from all periods of Plato’s writing. The general content and purpose of each dialogue will be debated, and then central, especially significant passages will be discussed in some detail with the help of secondary literature. Student involvement with what will be covered and how to interpret it is expected.**PHIL 7069 (3) Medieval Logic and Metaphysics |**Klima

This seminar is going to approach medieval logic and metaphysics not as a piece of history, but as genuine philosophy, to be taken seriously by a contemporary philosopher. The course is going to present an extended argument to show that if medieval metaphysical notions are reconstructed against their proper theoretical background (supplied by the sophisticated logical theories of the medievals, as opposed to modern analytic theories or vague historical intuitions), then they can provide us with a comprehensive, unified conceptual framework for discussing our genuine concerns which is unmatched in our fragmented “post-modern” culture. Although this course is primarily offered for philosophers, philosophically-minded medievalists and theologians may profit from it as well, especially if they are interested in tackling the logical subtleties of medieval metaphysical and theological discussions, No previous training in modern (or traditional) logic will be assumed. Main topics of discussion include: meaning (signification) and reference (supposition) in medieval logic; universals and common natures; mental language; nominalism, realism and ontological commitment; the concept of being and theories of the copula; the existence and essence of God; the immateriality of the intellective soul and the hylomorphic mereology of human nature; essentialism, nominalism and skepticism in late-medieval philosophy.**THEO 6196 (3) Early Christian Ritual |**Peppard

This graduate seminar surveys the evidence for ritual practices in the first four centuries of Christianity. Through engagement with primary sources and theoretical literature on ritual and identity formation, we will explore what can be known about early Christian practices and interrogate our means of knowing it. Much of the course will focus on the foundational rituals of initiation and Eucharist and their diverse interpretations in ancient sources, but other topics will be covered as time allows. We follow a comparative and regional approach to evidence from Syria, Jerusalem, Egypt, North Africa, Italy, etc. Prior study of New Testament or early Christian history will be presumed, but students will have diverse ancient language preparation (or none at all).**THEO 6426 (3) St. Augustine of Hippo |**Lienhard

The goal of this course is a critical understanding and appreciation of the life, writings, and thought of St. Augustine. The means to this goal is a guided reading and analysis of some of his writings and, secondarily, of some modern books about him. The following works will be read in their entirety: the Confessions, Soliloquies, On the Free Choice of the Will, Faith and the Creed, On Christian Doctrine, and On the Spirit and the Letter. The class will also read To Simplician I, selections from On the Trinity, and other texts from Augustine’s writings on the questions of grace, free choice, original sin, freedom, and predestination.

**Summer 2021****MVST 5311 (4) Arthurian Literature |**HafnerThis seminar will provide an overview over Arthurian romance themes and adaptations in Europe. Chrétien de Troyes may not have written the very first chivalric romance, but he was the pioneer who defined the genre and created the texts which would set the standard for centuries to come. The central role which Chrétien’s œuvre occupied in the French-speaking world is reflected in a wave of adaptations into many other vernacular languages, set off almost instantly and covering all of medieval Europe. In this class, we will focus on three literary traditions: the Yvain, Tristan and Perceval stories in their early Old French versions as well as their Middle High German, Middle English, and Old Norse adaptations. The degree to which these translations try to recreate their sources’ original content varies greatly and is determined by a nexus of cultural, political and social factors which we will examine in some detail. Students are expected to read the Middle English versions in well-annotated editions. All other texts can be prepared in English translation while some of the class time will be dedicated to closely reading some crucial passages in the original vernacular languages. Additional texts in other languages (Italian, Latin), in post-medieval renditions (e.g. T.S. Eliot’s Wasteland or Richard Wagner’s Parsifal), other media (films, opera, musicals), and material culture (frescoes, tapestries, book illuminations etc) will be determined based on the interest of the seminar participants.In addition, we will make use of the rich resources which New York City has to offer and explore some of the spectacular Arthurian artefacts housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Cloisters and the J. P. Morgan Museum and Library – online if necessary, on site if possible.**LATN 5090 (0) Latin for Reading |**McGowanA course designed for graduate students seeking a reading knowledge of Latin in their discipline.

**CLAS 6535 (3) Introduction to Digital Literary Studies |**Burns

This graduate seminar introduces students to the digital tools, resources, and methods used in producing publishable data-driven scholarship in classical philology and literary criticism. The course provides a forum for students to develop hands-on skills in computer programming for literary studies (using Python), focused primarily on string manipulation, text mining and analysis, and data visualization, and with a strong emphasis on research design, reproducibility and replicability, and changing modes of scholarly communication in the Humanities. The course culminates in a series of Digital Classics "case studies," through which students will be invited to use the skills acquired in the course to reproduce landmark data-driven studies in Classics by N. A. Greenberg, D. Packard, D. Clayman, and the Tesserae Project, among others. The course has no prerequisites and is open to students with no prior programming experience. While the case studies will be drawn largely from scholarship in Classics, the training acquired in the class will be useful to any GSAS student at Fordham working with digitized corpora and textual data. Moreover, students will have the opportunity to work on material in Latin, Ancient Greek, English, and/or, with the permission of the instructor, another language of their own choosing. This course will be taught at Lincoln Center.**ENGL 5111 (3) Race, Religion, and Monstrosity in Medieval Literature |**Yeager

The medieval taste for the exotic has introduced many audiences to a range of monstrous beings, from ferocious giants and dog-headed men to the peace-loving sciapod. Medieval studies of monstrosity have often been linked solely to the theorize the different human "races" found there. Yet the medieval language of monstrosity was not always limited to travel narrative, nor to the pejorative, for it was used to describe heros, saints, even the Chistian deity in far more familiar contexts than many would imagine. In this course we will examine the discourse of monstrosity as a complex critical lens through which premodern writers asked important questions of race, religion, civic virtue, human morality. We will read from Pliny, Augustine, the Beowulf Manuscript, medieval romance, and Mandeville's account.**ENGL 5112 (3) Medieval Time Travel |**Albin

“If I woke up tomorrow in the Middle Ages...” Why wait until tomorrow? The medieval may be much sooner than you think—it might even be now. Post-historicism, queer temporality, deconstructionist historiography, and affect studies have all revealed the creative intellectual promise of time bending back on itself, especially when brought to bear on texts, objects, spaces, and cultures that occupy the shadowy middle span between modernity and antiquity. In this course, we will build multidirectional conversations among medieval sources and modern theorists that ask how we come in contact with the temporal fullness of the Middle Ages, how the medieval irrupts in the now, and how we and our medieval interlocutors meet across centuries in the flesh of our lived experience. Topics in primary sources include medieval theories of time, ghost and undead narratives, liturgy, civic drama, musical notation, meditations on the life of Christ, and song, lyric, and performance. Theorists/critics may include: Henri Bergson, Alain Corbin, Margreta de Grazia, Jacques Derrida, Carolyn Dinshaw, Michel Foucault, Bruno Latour, André Lepicki, Carrie Noland, Rebecca Schneider, Eve Sedgwick, Michel Serres, Diana Taylor, Nicholas Watson, Siegfried Zielinski. We will read texts in Middle English; no former experience with the language is required.**HIST 6133 (4) Medieval Religious Institutions |**Mueller

Today, the Catholic Church appears as a hierarchical entity united under the supreme leadership of the pope. This is in contrast with the situation in the Middle Ages, when people made careful distinctions between monks, nuns, canons, secular priests, minor and major orders, cardinals, lay brothers and sisters, and a multitude of other clerics. Committed to their respective ranks and vocations, churchmen and churchwomen often found themselves competing with one another. In so doing, they were less likely to submit to papal authority than to enlist it for their own purposes. The seminar will examine these groups, their institutional identities, and typical conflicts of interest. The institutions of the medieval church-male and female monasteries, cathedral chapters, parishes, religious orders, dioceses, the papacy and other bodies-maintained their own two identities and pursued their own ends. The church they formed was not monolithic: medieval religious institutions were often in competition with one another for reasons both secular and religious; and, unlike modern church, religious institutions played a role in government and were the sole providers of many social services. Through consideration of medieval sources and modern studies, the course will examine the institutions that formed the medieval church, their histories, identities and members, their conflicts, and their relations to society.**HIST 7056 (4) PSM: Medieval Political Cultures |**Paul

This course, the first part of a two-semester proseminar/seminar sequence will introduce students to recent debates and different approaches to cultures of power and political processes in western Europe in the central middle ages. Among the many topics we might consider are lordship, status and authority, political assembly and consultation, courtliness and persuasion, rulership and sanctity, and the rise of accountability. Students will become familiar with a wide range of source material, from diplomatic and documentary collections to historical narratives and courtly literature. With this solid foundation in the current historiography and available research tools, students will be expected to identify a suitable topic for a sustained research project. Completing this project will be the objective of the seminar course to be offered in the Spring.**MVST 5080 (4) Interdisciplinary London: Med Mss, Sources, Methods |**Kowaleski

An introduction to methodologies in Medieval Studies through a focus on the primary sources and material culture of medieval London. The course will center on how an interdisciplinary approach that draws on a range of sources (textual, visual, and material) and methods (employed in archaeology, digital humanities, history, literary studies, and paleography/codicology) can enrich our understanding of one medieval place and its people. Training in paleography is an important element of the course.**PHIL 5010 (3) Introduction to Aquinas |**Davies

This course will be a general introduction to Aquinas's philosophical thinking. We shall pay special attention to his philosophy of God. We shall also turn to what he says about questions such as the scope of human knowledge, the nature of the human being, and the nature and significance of human action. As well as being expository, the course will consider the cogency of Aquinas's position on various topics. It will also try to relate what Aquinas says to what other philosophers, especially modern philosophers, have had to say. The course will not presuppose any previous detailed knowledge of Aquinas on the part of students.**THEO 6195 (3) Inventing Christianity: Apostolic Fathers, Apologists, Martyrs |**Welborn

A seminar on the literature produced by Christ believers during the second and third centuries CE—the so-called “Apostolic Fathers,” defenses of Christian faith and life, and accounts of the deaths of martyrs. The course seeks to comprehend the diverse ways in which Christian identity was shaped and to reconstruct the social experience of the early Christians. -

CRN 39394 (Kattan Gribetz) M 2:30 - 5 p.m.

In this course, students will learn about the ancient and medieval history of Jerusalem, from its Jebusite inhabitants before the time of King David through Suleiman’s construction of the modern city walls in the 1540s and the later Ottoman years. Students will gain experience analyzing a variety of sources—biblical and qur’anic texts, exegetical materials, travel narratives, legal documents, maps, poetry, literature, art, archaeology, and architecture—and use a range of different (inter)disciplinary and theoretical lenses through which to study them.**ENGL 5211 (3) Intro to Old English Language and Literature**

CRN 40648 (Chase) T 11 a.m. - 1:30 p.m.

This course is an introduction to Old English (Anglo-Saxon) language and literature. Old English was the language of England from the 7th to the 12th centuries, the language in which Beowulf was composed. We will read a representative selection of Anglo-Saxon prose and poetry in the original language, including The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, works by King Alfred and Bede, The Battle of Maldon, The Wanderer, The Seafarer, The Wife’s Lament, and The Dream of the Rood. Students will be introduced to Anglo-Saxon palaeography so that they can read the texts from medieval manuscripts as well as from printed editions.**HIST 6172 (4) Late Medieval and Early Modern Ireland**

CRN 39491 (Maginn) W 2:30 - 5 p.m.

This course will examine the history of Ireland from the height of the so-called Gaelic Revival in the mid-14th century to the violent collapse of Gaelic rule and the completion of the Tudor conquest in the early 17th century. Beginning in the late medieval period with an exploration between English and Gaelic worlds, the class will then chart the protracted incorporation of Ireland into a highly centralized early modern English state under the Tudors. With emphasis placed on the latest scholarly.**MVST 5064 (4) The Divine Comedy: Poetry, Theology, and the Medieval Imagination**

CRN 38947 (Susanna Barsella/Bob Davis) R 2:30 - 5 p.m.

This seminar offers an in-depth study of the poetic and theological imagination of Dante’s Divine Comedy. We will combine close reading of selected cantos with primary and secondary works illuminating key aspects of Dante’s literary and theological invention. Issues will be discussed within the historical and ideological contexts of the relevant theological and poetic debates in Dante's time. We will consider Dante’s theological influences, such as Augustine, Boethius, Bernard of Clairvaux, and Bonaventure, and explore theological topics such as medieval Christian practices of pilgrimage, scholastic debates about atonement and the afterlife, cosmology, and the relationship between erotic love and divine union in Christian mystical theology.**THEO 5230 (3) Advanced Greek: Early Christian Responses to Empire**

CRN 27209 (Peppard) R 9 - 11:30 a.m.

This course includes both a rapid review of Greek grammar and syntax, and also intermediate/advanced readings from Hellenistic and/or early Christian texts.**PHIL 7058 (3) Bonaventure's Metaphysics**

CRN: 39973 (Cullen) M 12:15 - 2:15 p.m.

This course will be a survey of the metaphysics of one of the great Scholastic thinkers of the Middle Ages- St. Bonaventure. Bonaventure says in a late set of university conferences that the whole of his metaphysics is found in emanation, exemplarity, and consummation. Students will examine all three parts of his metaphysics in order to obtain a synthetic view. This will involve examining his doctrine of being, including the transcendentals, his philosophical theology of God, and in particular, his exemplarism. Special attention will be given to Bonaventure’s reception of various Aristotelian doctrines and his attempt to synthesize these with various elements of the Augustinian and neo-Platonic heritage.The investigation of Bonaventure’s natural theology is now made possible by the recent translation of a major section of Bonaventure’s most important work, his Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard. In addition, the class will examine his famous Journey of the Mind to God (Itinerarium mentis ad Deum) as well as his Disputed Questions on the Mystery of the Trinity. In short, the aim of the course is to provide participants with a comprehensive overview of Bonaventure’s metaphysical thought.

**HIST 8025 (4) Medieval Religious Cultures**

CRN 39490 (Bruce) F 2:30 - 5 p.m.

Debates in the study of medieval religious culture and approaches to its study will be examined through works on the cult of saints, popular religion, and liturgy and ritual. Issues presented in the current literature will be tested by the close reading of selected primary sources.**Summer 2020****Summer Session I****MVST 5708 (4) Struggling Toward God: Meditation and Prayer in the Eleventh- and Twelfth-Century Monastery**

CRN TBA (Mancia) TR 11:00-3:00This course explores the dimensions of the medieval monastic contemplation in the heyday of Benedictine and Cistercian spiritual writing, the eleventh and twelfth centuries. The course will aim to answer the following questions: What did extra-liturgical prayer and meditation look like for medieval monks and nuns? When, where, and how was it practiced? Was there a set way to engage with monastic meditation, or were there a variety of medieval monastic meditative experiences in the eleventh and twelfth centuries? What did monks and nuns perceive as the limitations of monastic prayer and meditation? What extra-textual tools did monks and nuns rely upon to stimulate their practices of meditation? And what does monastic meditation reveal about the emotional lives of Benedictine and Cistercian monks and nuns in the high Middle Ages? For more information, contact Prof. Lauren Mancia at

**MVST 5077 (4) Editing Medieval Texts**

CRN 40198 (Reilly) T 2:30-5:00

This course explores the theory and practice of editing, especially as it relates to medieval texts. We will study how different types of edition influence our readings of texts, whether in literary criticism, historiography, theology, or other disciplines of medieval studies. Through practical exercises and a final editorial project, we will see how such editions get made and what choices underlie them. Our choices will be informed by reading both foundational and contemporary articles that argue for a particular rationale or editorial practice (Lachmannian, Best-Text, facsimile, documentary, versioning, etc). Special attention will be given to editorial practice in the digital age.**ENGL 6212 (3) Medieval to Early Modern Drama**

CRN 40702 (Erler) M 2:30-5:00

The great English medieval cycle plays have recently been re-appraised: the Chester plays are sixteenth century, performed after substantial religious change, and the Towneley plays probably represent a collection made for private reading. These are two examples of the way the course will examine the cultural context of late medieval/early modern English drama, including, for instance, some cycle plays, Mankynd, Everyman, (all in Middle English) Fulgens and Lucrece, Play of the Wether, and Marlowe's Doctor Faustus.**HIST 6136 (4) Disease in the Middle Ages**

CRN 41145 (Mueller) R 5:30-8:00

The seminar will explore the history of disease in the West from about 500 to 1500, including sudden epidemics like the Black Death, endemic illnesses such as leprosy, and the rise of theoretical, scientific, and literate university medicine alongside the academic laggards of surgery and midwifery. Particularly attention will be paid to issues that highlight the close nexus between medical and social practices. What accounted for the medieval rise of many enduring institutions in the health sector, for example, faculties of medicine and university-trained health practitioners who brandished the lucrative title of ‘doctor’? What rendered medical know-how ‘scientific’ at the time and gave it its strong public appeal? What is the relationship between supposedly modern ‘empirical’ medicine and its older ‘scholastic’ counterpart? And to which degree can we hope to ‘diagnose’ the illnesses medieval people actually suffered from?**HIST 7025 (4) PSM: Medieval Religious Cultures**

CRN 41082 (Bruce) F 2:30-5:00

Debates in the study of medieval religious culture and approaches to its study will be examined through the lens of monasticism. Topics of discussion will include the cult of the saints, popular religion, and the reception of the classical tradition. Issues presented in the current literature will be tested by the close reading of selected primary sources.**THEO 6490 (3) Christianity and Violence**

CRN 39985 (Demacopoulos) M 5:15-7:45

This course explores the often ambivalent relationship between Christianity and violence in the pre-modern world. Readings include a broad range of primary sources including martyr acts, liturgical hymns, canon law, and Crusader chronicles as well as influential scholarly assessments of the history of Christianity and violence.**THEO 6465 (3) Asceticism and Monasticism**

CRN 39984 (Lienhard) F 9:00-11:30

The course begins with a consideration of asceticism in Judaism, among pagans, and in early Christianity, including dedicated virginity, and then treats the history of the monastic movement up to the Carolingian era and Benedict of Aniane. The principal work of the course is reading and analyzing, in English translation, pertinent documents from this period, from four categories: lives of monks (Antony, Pachomius, Martin, Benedict), collected lives (Lausiac History, History of the Monks in Egypt, and others), rules (Basil, Augustine, the Master, Benedict), and theory (Evagrius of Pontus, John Cassian). Class reports and a substantial term paper are part of the course.**THEO 5300 (3) History of Christianity I**

CRN 39980 (Lienhard) W 6:00-8:30

The goal of this course is to introduce students to the history of Christian doctrine and theology in the period from the end of New Testament times to 1500. Doctrine is what the church of Jesus Christ believes, teaches, and confesses on the basis of the word of God (J. Pelikan). Theology is reflection on doctrine in light of oneself, one’s world, and one’s experience. The course will run on two parallel tracks. One track will be lectures, which will treat, first, the formation of the canon of the Bible, and then four principal doctrines of Christian faith: the one God whose name is Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; the person of Jesus the Christ, true God and true man; sin, grace, freedom, and predestination; and the presence of Christ in the Eucharist. The second track, which is intended to enhance participants’ understanding of the theologians and movements of the period, will consist of reading W. H. C. Frend’s*Rise of Christianity*, and five other short books, classics in the field, and reporting on them in writing. The course requires extensive reading, written reports, and one final examination; but, more than that, fascination with the best of Christian theologians and their thought.**PHIL 6505 (3) Medieval Philosophical Theories of the Fall**

CRN 40153 (Pini) W 12:00-2:00

This course will be devoted to the study of some medieval interpretations of the Christian doctrines of the fall of the devil and of original sin. The focus will be philosophical. We will study the positions of Anselm of Canterbury, Thomas Aquinas and John Duns Scotus. Some of the questions taken into account will be: "Is it possible to choose evil for evil's sake?" and "What is the motive of a morally wrong action?"**FREN 5090 (0) French for Reading**

**ENGL 5226 (3) Langland's Piers Plowman and the Poetry of Social Justice in Late Medieval England**

CRN 36126 (Wogan-Browne) T 2:30 - 5:15 p.m.

Chaucer’s great contemporary, William Langland, writes a different, equally brilliant and fascinating kind of verse, but is not harder to read than Chaucer. Langland’s dream-vision poem, Piers Plowman (composed, like Chaucer’s works, in late fourteenth-century London) treats many of the things Chaucer skirts or omits. “Piers Plowman!” is, famously, one of the rebel slogans from the 1381 uprising, and Langland’s accounts of social unrest, some forms of religious argument and conflict, policy and practices regarding poverty and his critique of social structures and experimentation with alternatives give us a different Middle Ages from Chaucer’s more court-centred writing. Langland also offers some challenging early visions of social justice that can often interrogate our own society’s priorities and assumptions. This course will put reading Piers Plowman, arguably the greatest single medieval English poem, at its center, while paying due attention to its context in other texts and in the poem’s surrounding world.**MVST 5102 (4) Theorizing Medieval Sound: Medieval Sonic Worlds**

CRN 37169 (Albin) W 4 - 7 p.m.

In this interdisciplinary seminar, we read widely and listen actively to the texts, music, and objects of the European Middle Ages to find out just how closely we can come to encountering medieval sonic worlds. Using an eclectic array of primary, secondary, and theoretical works, we study medieval sound cultures and the production of sonorous meanings for medieval listeners in all their complexity. At the same time, we investigate how open-minded engagement with the sonorous Middle Ages can challenge us to rethink prevailing popular and scholarly attitudes towards the body, the senses, media, and the past.**HIST 5203 (4) Medieval Hagiography**

CRN 35811 (Bruce) F 2:30 - 5 p.m.

This research seminar introduces students to the challenges and pitfalls of using saints' lives and other hagiographical writings (miracula, furta sacra, etc.) as sources for medieval history. It aims to familiarize students with competing historical approaches to these genres and to provide a practical guide to the scholarly resources necessary to exploit them as historical sources.**HIST 8110 (4) PSM: Church Law and Medieval Society**

CRN 35808 (Mueller) R 5:30 - 8 p.m.

This course is the second part of a two-semester proseminar/seminar sequence inviting graduate students to formulate and conduct original research projects in the field of medieval church law.

CRN 18395 (Davies) M 4 - 6 p.m.

This course will be a general introduction to Aquinas's philosophical thinking. We shall pay special attention to his philosophy of God. We shall also look at what he says about questions such as the scope of human knowledge, the nature of the human being, and the nature and significance of human action. As well as being expository, the course will consider the cogency of Aquinas's positions on various topics. It will also try to relate what Aquinas says to what other philosophers, especially modern and contemporary ones, have had to say. The course will not presuppose any previous knowledge of Aquinas on the part of students.**PHIL 5012 (3) Introduction to St. Augustine**

CRN 18396 (Cullen) W 1 - 3 p.m.

At the age of nineteen a young man living in Roman north Africa discovered philosophy. The world has never been the same since. While the world of the late Roman Empire—a world known for its decadence and brutality—teetered on the brink of collapse all about him, this teenager gave himself wholeheartedly to the pursuit of wisdom; he developed into one of greatest philosophical geniuses of all time—a genius who did more to shape the thought and culture of the next millenium of history than perhaps any other single individual. This course is a survey of the philosophy of this singularly influential intellectual—Augustine of Hippo. The course will begin by examining the philosophical currents that shaped Augustine, above all, Neo-platonism. We will then enter into the details of Augustine’s life, from his tumultuous and lurid youth in the streets of Carthage to his deathbed where he lay dying while the barbarians were literally at the gates. The course will discuss his intellectual struggle with Gnostic Manicheanism and skepticism. The course will follow Augustine on his inner journey into the depths of the human soul. In addition to his teachings on being and truth, the course will examine his philosophy of education and his history-making intervention in the centuries-long battle between Socrates and the Sophists. The last section of the course will focus on Augustine’s ethical and political ideas. Particular attention will be given to those seminal doctrines that have had a pervasive influence, such as his teachings on society, the political order, war, and his philosophy of history.**THEO 5230 (3) Advanced Greek: Church, State, and Power**

CRN 27209 (Peppard) R 9 - 11:30 a.m.

This graduate seminar situates early Christian discourse in a variety of Greek rhetorical contexts. If we call part of a Christian text “philosophical” or a “hymn,” for example, what would an ancient audience have expected from contemporaneous philosophy or hymns in Greek? By studying excerpts from the genres of biography, law, philosophy, hymn, and novel, along with selected orations, students will gain a richer sense of the rhetorical context into which early Christian discourse was proclaimed.**THEO 6367 (3) Byzantine Christianity: History and Theology**

CRN 36127 (Demacopoulos) M 2:30 - 5 p.m.

The graduate-level survey course introduces students to the theological ideas and historical transitions that captivated the minds of Eastern Christians from the 8th to the 15th centuries. Through a careful reading of primary sources (in English translation) and the scholarly debates about those sources, we will explore the Iconoclastic controversies, the expansion of Christianity to the Slavs, the experience of Christians living under Islamic authority, and a host of issues related to rupture between Eastern and Western Christianity. In most circumstances, successful completion of this course authorizes doctoral students in Theology to teach the undergraduate cognate course.**GERM 5002 (0) Graduate Reading in German II**60 (Hafner) TF 11:30 a.m. - 12:45 p.m.**CRN 179**## Summer 2019

Call #36780 (Rowe) W 11:30 a.m. - 2:15 p.m.

Introduction to the principles and materials in the study of medieval illuminated manuscripts as well as the historiography of the field. Issues examined include technical aspects of production of the illustrated book, contexts for making and use (monastic, urban, courtly), and iconographic and stylistic variables. Further topics include the history of collecting illuminated manuscripts and the availability of the works through digital media. Students will do hands-on work with primary sources at Fordham’s Rare Books and Manuscripts collection and will visit exhibitions and talk to experts at galleries and museums in New York, including the Morgan Library and Museum. Final projects will be tailored to the students’ primary research areas and expertise. Four-credit courses that meet for 150 minutes per week require three additional hours of class preparation per week on the part of the student in lieu of an additional hour of formal instruction.**ENGL 6234 (3) Race, Religion, and Monstrosity in Medieval Literature**

Call #36226 (Yeager) R 2:30 - 5 p.m.

The medieval taste for the exotic has introduced many audiences to a range of monstrous beings, from ferocious giants and dog-headed men to the peace-loving sciapod. Medieval studies of monstrosity have often been linked solely to the pre-modern understanding of the exotic East, and have been viewed as attempts to theorize the different human “races” found there. Moreover, crusading further complicated the discourses of monstrosity in the perception of non-Christian religious Other who was perceived, as Debra Higgs-Strickland put it, “as ugly as sin.” Yet, the medieval language of monstrosity was not always limited to travel narrative, nor to the pejorative, for it was used to describe heroes, saints, even the Christian deity in far more familiar contexts than many would imagine. In this course, we will examine the discourse of monstrosity as a complex critical lens through which pre-modern writers asked important questions of race, religion, civic virtue, and human morality. In our study, we will read selections from Pliny, Augustine, and others before moving through a range of texts, including the Beowulf manuscript, medieval drama, romance, and Mandeville’s account.**ENGL 5180 (3) Anthologizing Poetry in the Middle Ages**

Call #36597 (O’Donnell) M 2:30 - 5 p.m.

This course surveys important medieval poetry collections in several different languages in order to explore the shifting relationships between poetic expression, verse collection, and book production during the Middle Ages. How and why did medieval people collect poetry, and how should manuscript context guide our interpretation of individual works? Some tuition in Middle English will be provided; translations will be available for literature in other languages.**HIST 6077 (4) The Angevin Empire**

Call# 36436 (Paul) T 2:30 - 5 p.m.

From the middle of the twelfth until the first quarter of the thirteenth centuries, one dynasty, the house of Anjou, were the effective rulers of an enormous agglomeration of kingdoms and principalities which stretched from the North Sea to the Mediterranean and encompassed England, large parts of Ireland, Wales, and nearly half of the territory which today constitutes modern France. Following a wave of renewed scholarly interest in the politics and culture of this period, this class will explore this short-lived but powerful domain, its lands, peoples, and rulers. Among other topics, we will explore the dynamic lives and cultures of the court, strategies, and technologies of governance, politics and their diplomacy, the extraordinary phenomenon of the Third Crusade, and the legacies of the Angevin dominion in England and France after the conquest of Normandy 1204.**HIST 7110 (4) PSM: Church Law and Medieval Society**

This team-taught interdisciplinary course introduces students to the cultural world of a medieval south: Occitania, a region defined by language stretching from the foothills of the Alps to the pathways across the Pyrenees and from the Mediterranean almost to the Loire. Students will study the Old Occitan language and its manifestations in documentary writing, historical narrative, and the poetry of the troubadours from the eleventh to the thirteenth centuries. In order to best understand the context for this literature, course topics will include urban and rural communities, gender and power, the Albigensian crusade and its aftermath, and the rise of vernacular book production.**ENGL 5210: Introduction to Old Norse Language and Literature**

They complete the seminar by giving a 20-minute conference paper on their research project and writing a thesis-length original research paper that could be published as a scholarly article.**PHIL 5010: Introduction to St Thomas Aquinas**

Call# 18395 (Davies) M 4:00-6:00

Aquinas is often, and rightly, taken to be a theologian who assumes that certain truths have to be revealed to us by God since we lack the ability to demonstrate them. But he also engaged in what is commonly called ‘natural theology’ — i.e. philosophical argumentation aiming to prove that there is some knowledge of God to be attained by human reason. In this course we shall be looking at Aquinas’s natural theology, chiefly as presented in his Summa Theologiae, but also as we find it in his Summa Contra Gentiles. We shall see how Aquinas approaches the notion of natural theology in general. We shall then see how Aquinas argues for certain conclusions concerning the existence and nature of God. Given the importance of natural theology for Aquinas’s philosophy as a whole, and given the fact that Aquinas draws on metaphysical notions scattered throughout his writings, the course will provide a serious introduction to Aquinas’s thinking in general. This will be primarily a lecture course, but will include class discussions. Partly to stimulate them, numerous comparisons and contrasts will be made between what Aquinas has to say and what other philosophers have argued since early modern times. The course will relate Aquinas’s natural theology to that of other thinkers, including contemporary analytical ones. This course can satisfy for either the medieval requirement or for the contemporary analytical one. This course will not require a knowledge of Latin, and it will not presuppose any previous familiarity with the thinking of Aquinas or that of any other medieval philosopher.**PHIL 5012: Introduction to St Augustine**

Call# 18396 (Pini) W 12:00-2:00

This course will provide a survey of some of the key aspects of St. Augustine’s thought. Topics will include faith and reason; divine ideas; the theology of the Holy Trinity; mind; skepticism; divine foreknowledge and predestination and human free will; the problem of evil; original sin and divine grace; happiness; human history and society. These topics will be approached by studying relevant sections from Augustine’s major works. Ideally, each class will consist of an introductory lecture (first hour) and discussion on the readings (second hour). This format may vary according to what the material requires and the needs of students. Students are expected to complete the readings in advance and take an active role in the discussion.**THEO 6426: St. Augustine**

Call# 33462**(Lienhard) M 2:30-5:00**

Jaroslav Pelikan adapts Whitehead’s remark about philosophy’s being a series of footnotes to Plato and wonders whether western theology is a series of footnotes to Augustine. This, at least, can be said: from the fifth century until the introduction of Aristotle into Europe, western theology was a conversation with Augustine. St. Augustine of Hippo (354-430) would be important to theology if he had written only*On the Trinity*, or only*The City of God*, or only the*Confessions.*But he wrote all three, and more than 120 other books besides. When the tradition honors him, however, it honors him as the*doctor gratiae*, the Doctor of Grace. The goal of this course is a critical understanding and appreciation of the life, writings, and thought of St. Augustine. The means to this goal is a guided reading and analysis of some of his writings and, secondarily, of some modern books about him. The following works will be read in their entirety: the*Confessions*,*On Christian Doctrine*, and*On the Spirit and the Letter*. The class will also read*To Simplician*I, selections from*On the Trinity*and the*City of God*, and passages from Augustine’s writings on the questions of original sin, free choice, grace, freedom, and predestination. Requirements for the course are: extensive reading; insatiable curiosity; several short written assignments, class reports, a 20-page term paper, and a final examination.**THEO 5076: Syriac Language and Literature II**

**MVST 5570 (4)****Medieval Monsters: Terrors, Aliens, Wonders****(Mittman,****Lindquist****)****Session I MW 9 - 1pm**

This course examines the vital role played by monsters in medieval art and culture. The word “monster” evokes powerful visions of strange and unnatural creatures. Monsters and monstrosities possess a transformative power that makes them at once profoundly dangerous and utterly fascinating. More than mere figments of the imagination, monsters have played an important role throughout the history, and were central to medieval thought. The very act of visualizing monsters—giving shape to them in art and literature—constitutes an important step toward defining and therefore controlling the unknown. During the European Middle Ages, theologians accepted the supernatural character of monsters as part of a divine plan. Medieval scholars traced the meaning of the word “monster” to the Latin verbs “monstrare” (to show) and “monere” (to warn). As divine lessons, monsters provided testimony to God’s active intervention in the world. The ubiquity and variety of monstrosities in the art of the Middle Ages attest to their cultural importance and multifaceted nature. Readings will include primary sources (eg. Pliny, Isidore of Seville, Augustine of Hippo, The Book of Mandeville, The Wonders of the East, Bisclavret) and readings in monster theory and related approaches (eg. Jeffrey Cohen, Patricia MacCormack, Noël Carrol, Homi Bhabha). The course will run in conjunction with an exhibition of the same title at the Morgan Library & Museum, co-curated by Mittman and Professor Sherry Lindquist. The exhibition will feature sixty sumptuously illuminated manuscripts, as well as additional objects in other medieval media. The course will be divided into three overlapping sections, following the division of the exhibition. Some sessions will be conducted in the gallery, and the class will also visit other major collections (The Met, The Cloisters) and the conception, design, and implementation of the exhibition will be covered in the course.**MVST 8999 (1-4) Tutorial: Study Tour of Medieval Spain**

One of the great medieval pilgrimage routes, the Camino de Santiago crosses northern Spain from the passes of the Pyrenees to Santiago de Compostela. This tutorial will consider the legends of the Camino, some of its many surviving monuments, and the modern revival of the pilgrimage. The bulk of the tutorial consists of walking for two weeks as a peregrino/a from Leon to Santiago de Compostela. This class will meet periodically at Fordham before the walk to discuss reading assignments and prepare. Depending on the student's interest, the final project could involve devising a syllabus for future teaching or focus on some element of the pilgrimage and its history in the form of a journal.**LATIN 5090 (0) Latin for Reading**

**MVST 5077 (4) Editing Medieval Texts**

Call# 34045 (Reilly) W 5:30 - 8 p.m.

This course explores the theory and practice of editing medieval texts. We will study how different types of edition influence our readings of texts, whether in literary criticism, historiography, theology, or other disciplines of medieval studies. Through practical exercises and a final editorial project, we will see how such editions get made and what choices underlie them. Our choices will be informed by reading both foundational and contemporary articles that argue for a particular rationale or editorial practice (Lachmannian, Best-Text, facsimile, documentary, versioning, etc.). Special attention will be given to editorial practice in the digital age.**ENGL 6224 (3) French of England: Texts and Literacies**

Call # 33283 (Wogan-Browne) T 5:30 - 8:30 p.m.

French of England helps prepare graduates in medieval disciplines deploy the newly important multilingual paradigms for the study of medieval English and related cultures. Each French of England course explores a different selection from the rich and under-researched francophone corpus (c. 1000 literary texts and large bodies of documentary records) composed and/or circulating in medieval England and related regions from the twelfth to the fifteenth centuries. French was a major regional and transnational language in England, used in literature, governance, administration, culture, trade, and the professions. Taking francophone literary and documentary culture into account changes our paradigms for English medieval literary history and prompts new thought about the relations between literature, literacy, and the entities we call ‘language’. Aiming to move as rapidly as possible from the pains of language-learning to the pleasures of reading text, the course combines a weekly linguistic practicum with a literary seminar and runs from 5.30 to 8.30pm on Tuesdays with a short refreshment break between the two parts. Previous experience of Old French is not required; basic reading or speaking of modern French is useful; experience with other languages is also sometimes enough of a help. If in doubt about whether your language experiences will be helpful, please email[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)**ENGL 6231 (3) Late Medieval Women**

Call# 33284 (Erler) R 10:30 a.m. - 1 p.m.

The course will study women as producers and consumers of literature, that is as writers and readers. Instead of examining women as subjects of literary representation, we will use non-literary disciplines--social history, bibliography, iconography--to recover elements of women's lives in order to understand their involvement with reading. Like much current medieval scholarship, the class will employ cultural perspectives in which literature, history, and visual materials illuminate each other.**HIST 6078 (4) The Crusader States: The Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem 1099-1291**

Call# 33885 (Paul) W 2:30 - 5 p.m.

This course charts the social, political, and cultural history of the feudal principalities that were established by Latin Christians in the Eastern Mediterranean in the wake of the First Crusade. Students will be introduced to the narrative and documentary sources through which the history of the Latin Kingdom has been constructed, as well as the archaeology and art of the Levant during the period of Frankish occupation and settlement. In addition, we will engage with the major historiographical debates concerning the constitutional organization of the Latin kingdom, the relationship between the Frankish crusaders and the Muslim and eastern Christian populations over whom they ruled, and the “colonial” character of the Latin settlements.**HIST 7150 (4) Proseminar: Medieval England**

Call# 33886 (Kowaleski) T 2:30 - 5 p.m.

This course focuses on the social, economic, and administrative history of England from the eleventh through fifteenth centuries. Special emphasis is placed upon: 1) how to identify and exploit primary sources (such as wills, cartularies, court rolls, account rolls,and chronicles, among others) relevant to your research interests; 2) how to use major historical collections (such as Rolls Series, VCH, Record Commissioners, Royal Historical Manuscripts Commission, the Ordnance Survey, Selden Society, and others); and 3) gaining an awareness of the regions and landscape of medieval England, as well as the contributions of archaeology and historical geography. Besides treating thematic issues such as the church and society, law and legal system, the growth of government and administration, maritime trade and industry in town and country, the weekly discussions will also consider the society and economy of the peasantry, townspeople, and the landowning elite.**THEO 5300 (3/4) History of Christianity I**

Call# 33241 (Lienhard) M 5:15 - 7:45 p.m.

The history of the doctrines and theology of Christianity from New Testament times to A.D. 1500. Topics treated are the canon of the Bible, the Trinity, the Person of Christ, grace and predestination, and the presence of Christ in the Eucharist. To accompany this study, books by some classic authors will be read: Jean Leclercq, Joseph Pieper, Etienne Gilson, and others, along with W. H. C. Frend's The Rise of Christianity.**THEO 6198: The Self in Early Christianity (3)**

Call# 33244 (Dunning) W 9 - 11:30 a.m.

This course will explore various notions of the self in early and late ancient Christianity. We will begin by studying the broader philosophical context (as explored by thinkers such as Michel Foucault, Pierre Hadot, and Richard Sorabji) in which early Christians wrestled with various facets of what it means to be human. We will also investigate specific problems of theological anthropology that emerged in formative Christian thought at the intersection of broader late ancient ideas about biology, gender, embodiment, and cultural identity with specifically Christian notions such as scripture, incarnation, and resurrection.**THEO 5075: Syriac Language and Literature I**

Call# 33249 (Fiano) F 9 -11:30 a.m.

This course is part of a two-semester introduction to Syriac, a dialect belonging to the Aramaic language branch. The first semester will introduce the scripts, cover grammatical foundations, and expose students from early on to the reading of texts. The second semester will be mostly spent reading Syriac literature, but some time will be devoted to select special topics in Syriac grammar. It is possible to take the first semester only.**FREN 5090 (0) French for Reading, Call# 24288 (TBA) W 8:30 - 11 a.m.****GERM 5001 (0) Graduate Reading in German I, Call# 15446 (Ebner) TF 11:30 a.m. - 12:45 p.m.** -

**MVST 5100 (4) Cultures of Music and Sound in the Medieval World**

Call # 31362**(Albin and Bianchi) T 1:00 – 4:00 PM**

Music and sound enriched every facet of pre-modern life, liturgy and ritual above all. This interdisciplinary seminar introduces medievalists – especially those without formal musical education – to the cultures of medieval and Renaissance music. It should enable students from any discipline to engage music and the sonic more fully in their own research and teaching. We will move chronologically across the millennium from Boethius to the Council of Trent; each session raises questions drawn from a smaller set of musical ideas and practices. We will devote equal attention to surveying the variety of approaches in contemporary scholarship, and to developing musical vocabularies and analytical tools. No prior musical knowledge required.**ENGL 6235 (3) The French of England: Language and Texts in a Multilingual Culture**

Call # 29793 (Wogan-Browne) R 4:00 – 7:00 PM

French of England helps prepare graduates in medieval disciplines deploy the newly important multilingual paradigms for the study of medieval English and related cultures. It looks at the rich and still under-researched francophone corpus (c. 1000 literary texts and large bodies of documentary records) composed and/or circulating in medieval England and related regions from the twelfth to the fifteenth centuries. French was a major regional and transregional language in England, used in literature, governance, administration, culture, trade, and the professions. Following francophone texts also takes us into geopolitical realities beyond the idea of nation- for example into texts that are simultaneously texts of England and texts of the Angevin/Plantagenet empire, or of England and the Mediterranean. Taking francophone literary and documentary culture into account changes our paradigms for medieval literary history and prompts new thought about the relations between literature, literacy, and language. Aiming to move as rapidly as possible from the pains of language-learning to the pleasures of reading text, the course combines a weekly linguistic practicum with a literary seminar. Previous experience of Old French is not required; basic reading or speaking of modern French is useful; experience with other languages is also sometimes enough of a help. If in doubt about whether your language experiences will be helpful, or if you have any other questions, please e-mail[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)(For those who took French of England in 2015 and who wish to pursue it further, this course will offer few overlaps and mostly different texts from those you have already met).**HIST 6133 (4) Medieval Religious Institutions**

Call # 30193 (Müller) M 5:30 – 8:00 PM

In modern usage, the term 'religious' refers to everything having to do with religion. Instead, the medieval Latin*religiosus*was employed rather narrowly to denote matters concerning the regulated (monastic) life. The English expression 'institution' is again quite vague and has no single medieval equivalent. It applies equally to inanimate and abstract entities, to territorial and personal status, and to procedures, whether defined legally or by custom. The seminar will adopt the current understanding of 'religious institutions' in the broadest sense and apply it to various phenomena of medieval social and ecclesiastical history. Basic administrative units of the Western Church such as bishoprics, the practice of priestly ordination, and clerical status obtained institutional definition as early as in late Antiquity. Other institutions did not acquire shape until the twelfth-century systematization of canon law, including papal monarchy, the college of cardinals, canonical elections, and women's 'religious' movements. The course will examine some of these institutions, their juridical and spiritual identities, strategies of self-representation, and major institutional trends and conflicts.**HIST 8056 (4) SEM: Medieval Political Cultures**

Call # 30192 (Paul) W 5:30 – 8:00 PM

In the Spring semester component of the seminar sequence, students work on final projects based on topics identified in the Fall. These projects are intended to be sustained, original research papers of publishable quality. Class meetings will be devoted to honing research, writing, and presentation skills. All aspects of the writing process will be discussed, and students will have opportunities to read and critique each other’s' writing. The course will conclude with a mini-conference allowing students to present their work before an audience of other scholars.**PHIL 5010 (3) Introduction to St. Thomas**

Call # 18395 (Davies) M 4:00 – 6:00 PM

This course will be a general introduction to Aquinas's philosophical thinking. We shall pay special attention to his philosophy of God. We shall also turn to what he says about questions such as the scope of human knowledge, the nature of the human being, and the nature and significance of human action. As well as being expository, the course will consider the cogency of Aquinas's position on various topics. It will also try to relate what Aquinas says to what other philosophers, especially modern philosophers, have had to say. The course will not presuppose any previous detailed knowledge of Aquinas on the part of students.**PHIL 5012 (3) Introduction to St. Augustine**

Call # 18396 (Cullen) R 1:30**– 3:30 PM**

At the age of nineteen a young man living in Roman north Africa discovered philosophy. The world has never been the same since. While the world of the late Roman Empire—a world known for its decadence and brutality—teetered on the brink of collapse all about him, this teenager gave himself wholeheartedly to the pursuit of wisdom; he developed into one of greatest philosophical geniuses of all time—a genius who did more to shape the thought and culture of the next millennium of history than perhaps any other single individual. This course is a survey of the philosophy of this singularly influential intellectual—Augustine of Hippo. The course will begin by discussing the philosophical currents that shaped Augustine, especially Neo-platonism, before moving on to Augustine’s life, which students will trace, from his tumultuous and lurid youth in the streets of Carthage to his deathbed where he lay dying while the barbarians were literally at the gates. The course will discuss his intellectual struggle with Gnostic Manicheanism and skepticism. The course will follow Augustine on his inner journey into the depths of the human soul. In addition to his teachings on being and truth, the course will examine his philosophy of education and his history-making intervention in the centuries-long battle between Socrates and the Sophists. The last section of the course will focus on Augustine’s ethical and political ideas. Particular attention will be given to those seminal doctrines that have had a pervasive influence, such as his teachings on history, society, and the political order.**THEO 6194 (3) History, Theory, and Christianity**

Call # 29764 (Dunning) W 9:00 – 11:30AM

This course will provide a thorough introduction to recent developments in historiography and critical theory in light of the so-called "linguistic turn."

Call # 10159 (Paul) Session I, TR 4 - 7 p.m.This course adopts an interdisciplinary approach to the study of the medieval crusades in the Levant, southern France, Iberia, and the Baltic, with attention paid to the Islamic and Byzantine perspectives. The sources to be discussed include chronicles, charters, sermons, literary texts, songs, and hagiography, as well as architectural and artistic monuments and objects. Among the themes to be treated are crusader motivations, crusades and memory, European “colonization,” women and family in crusading society, crusading liturgies, the military orders, and diplomacy.

**MVST 8999 (1-4) Tutorial: Study Tour of Medieval Spain**

Call # 24286 (Myers) (TBA)One of the great medieval pilgrimage routes, the Camino de Santiago crosses northern Spain from the passes of the Pyrenees to Santiago de Compostela. This tutorial will consider the legends of the Camino, some of its many surviving monuments, and the modern revival of the pilgrimage. The bulk of the tutorial consists of walking for two weeks as a peregrino/a from Leon to Santiago de Compostela. This class will meet periodically at Fordham before the walk to discuss reading assignments and prepare. Depending on the student's interest, the final project could involve devising a syllabus for future teaching or focus on some element of the pilgrimage and its history in the form of a journal.

**MVST 5070 (4) Manuscript Culture**

Call #30314 (Hafner) F 2 - 5 p.m.This course will examine manuscript culture from the third through the fifteenth centuries, with particular attention to questions of textual transmission and illuminated adornment. Issues examined will include: the principles, materials, and study of medieval manuscripts and primary documents; the problems of evaluation of the cultural contexts of their production and use; manuscript illumination; the resources of codicology and palaeography; the preparation and evaluation of modern editions; the assessment of readership and patronage; philology and the materialism of the Middle Ages; or the development of libraries. The course will include visits to local manuscript libraries, such as Special Collections at Walsh Library, Rare Books and Manuscripts at Columbia University, the Rare Book Collection of the NY Public Library, and the Morgan Library. Students will have the opportunity to do hands-on work with primary sources. Their final projects will be tailored to their research areas and expertise and must be based on the study of an original manuscript.

**ENGL 6106 (3) Medieval Communities and Modern Thought**

Call #31130 (O'Donnell) T 12:30 - 3 p.m.This interdisciplinary course will consider the roles played by modern images and ideas of the medieval past in the formulation of modern ideas of community, nation, subjectivity, and habitus. Course readings will include modern theoretical texts and medieval source material (mostly in translation). What can a more vital understanding of the medieval past offer modern thinking about community and belonging? The course will be appropriate for medieval specialists as well as for anyone interested in the intersections of social history, social theory, and literature.

**ENGL 6235 (3) Medieval Travel Narrative**

Call #29896 (Yeager) R 2:30 - 5 p.m.In a project which brought together the greatest minds and resources of the western world, the crusading movements inspired subsequent generations of Western European poets and chroniclers to create some of the most beautiful and, at times, most brutal romances and histories ever written. This course will focus on a range of traditions, including the romance, Richard, Coeur de Lion in light of contemporary chronicler, Roger of Howden's, Chronica. Even Josephus' Jewish War is barely recognizable in the fourteenth-century Siege of Jerusalem. Pilgrim and merchant narratives, from Egeria to Margery Kempe, and Mandeville to Marco Polo, will provide a contrast to romance and chronicle modes. We will be especially concerned with the ways in which chivalric quest came to influence the romance and chronicle genres. This course is designed to contextualize travel within the medieval world as we read and discuss those travel narratives with a specific set of concerns: salvation, conquest, and conversion.

**HIST 6152 (4) Medieval Women and Family**

Call #30306 (Kowaleski) T 4 - 6:30 p.m.This course surveys recent historiography on the roles and status of women in medieval society, as well as the structures and dynamics of medieval families. Among the debates to be explored are the effect on medieval society of the Christian Church's teachings on virginity, sex, and marriage, and the influence of geography (northern vs Mediterranean Europe), environment (village, town, and convent), and status (noble, bourgeois, or peasant) on the work, family role, and authority of women. Chronologically the course will range from the early Christian period to the Renaissance. Recent scholarly work on nuns, mystics, and beguines will be examined, and readings will also cover different approaches to the study of women and family, including the methodologies of literary scholars, demographers, feminists, and legal historians.

**HIST 7056 (4) Proseminar: Medieval Political Cultures**

Call #30307 (Paul) W 5 - 7:20 p.m.This course, the first part of a two-semester proseminar/seminar sequence will introduce students to recent debates and different approaches to cultures of power and political processes in western Europe in the central middle ages. Among the many topics we might consider are: lordship, status and the sources of political authority; the origins and significance of consultative assemblies; the rituals and rhetoric of courtliness and persuasion; the relationship between rulership and sanctity; and the rise of accountability. Through in-class presentations and discussions, students will become familiar with a wide range of source material, from diplomatic and documentary collections to historical narratives and courtly literature. With this solid foundation in the current historiography and available research tools, students will be expected to identity a suitable topic for a sustained research project. Completing this project will be the objective of the seminar course offered in Spring 2017.

**PHIL 5001 (3) Introduction to Plato**

Call #11387 (Johnson) T 2 - 4 p.m.Study of Plato's developing thought, starting with the materials he inherited from poetic and philosophical forerunners, and analyzing how his original ethical-political interests compelled him to confront epistemological, metaphysical, and theological concerns. Course will focus mainly, but not exclusively, on early and middle dialogues.

**PHIL 5009 (3) Introduction to Aristotle**

Call #11393 (Tress) M 11 a.m. - 1 p.m.An introduction to the thought of Aristotle through the study of the De Anima and the Metaphysics.

**PHIL 7080 (3) Medieval Views on Cognition and Certainty**

Call #29878 (Pini) M 1:30 - 3:30 p.m.Several later medieval authors inquired about the limits of what can be known and the extent to which we can say we are certain of something. Are our cognitive powers sufficient to put us in a state in which we cannot possibly be wrong? Or do we need some external, i.e. superhuman, help to reach that state? And is a state of absolute certainty something we should be willing to achieve at all? What is the scope of our cognitive powers? What are their limits? And, for that matter, what does it mean to be certain of something? In this course, we will consider these and related questions in the writings of thirteenth- and fourteenth-century authors such as John Duns Scotus, Henry of Ghent, Nicholas of Autrecourt and others. While dealing with the legacy of Aristotle and Augustine and exploring the extent to which superhuman beings can deceive us, those authors laid the premises of the early modern debate on certainty and skepticism. The course will be based on the close reading of texts in English translation and the detailed consideration of the arguments contained in those texts.

**THEO 6465 (3) Asceticism and Monasticism**

Call #29903 (Lienhard) M 2:30 - 5 p.m.The course begins with a consideration of asceticism in Judaism, among pagans, and in early Christianity, including dedicated virginity, and then treats the history of the monastic movement up to the Carolingian era and Benedict of Aniane. The principal work of the course is reading and analyzing, in English translation, pertinent documents from this period, from four categories: lives of monks (Antony, Pachomius, Martin, Benedict), collected lives (Lausiac History, History of the Monks in Egypt, and others), rules (Basil, Augustine, the Master, Benedict), and theory (Evagrius of Pontus, John Cassian).

**THEO 6445 (3) Affect, Emotion, and Religious Experience**

Call #29901 (Davis) W 9 - 11:30 a.m.This course will explore the diverse engagements with affect and emotion across the humanities and social sciences in terms of their potential to open up new approaches for thinking theologically and historically about embodied religious experience. The first part of the course will situate the articulation of religious experience as the foundation for the modern study of religion as a human science within a broader philosophical and theological genealogy of affect, emotions, passions, and moral sentiments. The second part of the course will take up recent work in affect theory, psychoanalysis, and the history of emotions. On the one hand, there has been an effort among some historians and philosophers, drawing on cognitive science, to argue for the “intelligence” of emotions as rational, judicative functions with which individuals and groups manage subjective and social life. On the other hand, much recent work in feminist and queer theory, disability studies, critical race theory, and political theory takes as its point of departure precisely those dynamics of affect—what Brian Massumi calls a “prepersonal intensity”—that are irreducible to rationality, subjectivity, and signification, either via Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari’s reading of Spinoza, or through psychoanalytic approaches to grief, trauma, and melancholia. The final section of the course will think critically and constructively about how these diverse theoretical approaches might inform our own theological and historical approaches to religious experience.

**MVST 5905 (4) Medieval Pilgrimage**

Call#28764 (Gyug, Yeager) R 2:30 - 5 p.m.

"Medieval Pilgrimage" is a new graduate seminar, team taught by Dr. Richard Gyug (History) and Dr. Suzanne Yeager (English). Over the course of the semester we will focus on a variety of medieval pilgrims and their destinations, ranging from the well-known shrine at Compostela to those places mainly frequented by local audiences such as the shrine of St. Foy. In this seminar, we conceptualize pilgrimage broadly, entertaining a variety of aims for travel, and also considering the pilgrimage form as a purely conceptual exercise (seen, for instance, inThe Travels of Sir John Mandeville) as well as those with more practical aims - such as the pilgrim's guide to Jerusalem supplied by William Wey. We will also consider relics and the process of shrine-making and promotion intranslation accounts. Through the work of medieval as well as contemporary scholars of pilgrimage, we will consider pilgrimage anthropologically as well as a component of a variety of religious and political ideals of the Middle Ages. Readings include Egeria's Letter, Guibert of Nogent's treatise on relics, promotional materials of the crusading era,The Marvels of Rome, the Liber Sancti Jacobi, the Mandeville writer, the Voyage of St. Brendan, Edith and Victor Turners' twentieth-century work on pilgrimage, and many others.**MVST 6209 (4) Themes in Preconquest Literature**

We will read (in Old English) a variety of texts from the period, including poetry, homilies, saints' lives, and chronicles. Substantial attention will also be given to Anglo-Saxon palaeography and relevant critical literature, with the aim of providing students with the resources needed for the scholarly study of Old English. Prior knowledge of Old English is expected.**ENGL 6215: (3) Medieval British Historical Writing**

Call#27483 (O'Donnell) F 2:30 - 5 p.m.

History-writing was fundamental to medieval and early-modern literary sensibilities, but in its relation to truth, genre, and identity, medieval history differs dramatically from contemporary understandings of the discipline of history. This course will introduce you to the major historiographical thinkers and practitioners of the English Middle Ages and include selections from Gildas, Bede, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Dudo of Saint-Quentin, Geoffrey of Monmouth, Matthew Paris, and the Middle English Brut.**HIST 5202 (4) Medieval Interfaith Relations**

Call#28270 (Novikoff) T 5:30 - 8 p.m.

Interfaith relations are today a valuable and potentially urgent category of historical analysis. This seminar explores the relations among Christians, Muslims, and Jews across Europe and the Mediterranean from early medieval papal policy to rise of the Ottoman Turks, with a particular focus on religious, intellectual, and cultural instances of interfaith conflict and coexistence. Attention will especially be given to historiographical models that have attempted to understand how such relations are useful to the modern world.**HIST 5553 (4) Book History: Texts, Media, Communication**

Call#27257 (Rigogne) W 5:30 - 8 p.m.

This course explores the history of media and communication in general, as well as textual scholarship. Topics range across time periods and continents, with particular focus on the medieval and early modern transitions, as well as on more recent "media revolutions." It will introduce graduate students to key works, concepts and methodologies that analyze how communication media of all sorts (from manuscripts to printed books, newspapers and images, from songs and rumors to audiovisual and digital media) have been a driving force in history, and have shaped all historical research. We will study texts and methods drawn from a wide variety of historical fields, as well as from sociology, anthropology, philosophy, literary criticism, art history, bibliography and media studies, all of which provide historians with powerful insights and indispensable tools and skills.**HIST 8110 (4) SEM: Church Law and Medieval Society**

Call#27255 (Müller) W 2:30 - 5:30 p.m.

The course forms the second part of a two-semester pro-seminar/seminar sequence and invites graduate students to pursue original research projects in the field of medieval church law. Their inquiries may address a wide range of issues, such as legal theory, judicial practice, and the medieval uses and perceptions of canonical justice. The previous pro-seminar has provided an introduction to the field and helped formulate appropriate study agendas. This seminar will offer a forum for the presentation, discussion, and refinement of each participant's scholarly work-in-progress. The ultimate goal will be to submit a fully annotated 30 to 40-page essay which successfully analyzes select source material.**PHIL 5010 (3) Intro to Aquinas**

**MVST 5077 (4) Editing Medieval Texts (Reilly)****Call#27616, R 5:30 - 8 p.m.**

This course explores the theory and practice of editing medieval texts. We will study how different types of edition influence our readings of texts, whether in literary criticism, historiography, theology, or other disciplines of medieval studies. Through practical exercises and a final editorial project, we will see how such editions get made and what choices underlie them. Our choices will be informed by reading both foundational and contemporary articles that argue for a particular rationale or editorial practice (Lachmannian, Best-Text, facsimile, documentary, versioning, etc.). Special attention will be given to editorial practice in the digital age.**ENGL 6224 (3) The French of England: Texts and Literacies in a Multilingual Culture (Wogan-Browne)****Call#29066, T 4 - 6:30 p.m.**

French of England helps prepare graduates in medieval disciplines deploy the newly important multilingual paradigms for the study of medieval English and related cultures. It looks at the rich and still under-researched francophone corpus (c. 1000 literary texts and large bodies of documentary records) composed and/or circulating in medieval England and related regions from the twelfth to the fifteenth centuries. French was a major regional and transnational language in England, used in literature, governance, administration, culture, trade, and the professions. Taking francophone literary and documentary culture into account changes our paradigms for English medieval literary history and prompts new thought about the relations between literature, literacy, and language. Aiming to move as rapidly as possible from the pains of language-learning to the pleasures of reading text, the course combines a weekly linguistic practicum with a literary seminar and runs from 4pm to 7.00 pm on Tuesdays. Previous experience of Old French is not required; basic reading or speaking of modern French is useful; experience with other languages is also sometimes enough of a help.**ENGL 6231 (3) Late Medieval Women: Reading, Texts, Audiences (Erler)**

Call#27332, M 2:30 - 5 p.m.

The course will study women as producers and consumers of literature, that is as writers and readers. Instead of examining women as subjects of literary representation, we will use non-literary disciplines--social history, bibliography, iconography--to recover elements of women's lives in order to understand their involvement with reading. Like much current medieval scholarship, the class will employ cultural perspectives in which literature, history, and visual materials illuminate each other.**HIST 6078 (4) The Crusader States: Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem 1099-1291 (Paul)****Call#27124, W 5:30 - 8 p.m.**

This course charts the social, political, and cultural history of the feudal principalities that were established by Latin Christians in the Eastern Mediterranean in the wake of the First Crusade. Students will be introduced to the narrative and documentary sources through which the history of the Latin Kingdom has been constructed, as well as the archaeology and art of the Levant during the period of Frankish occupation and settlement. In addition, we will engage with the major historiographical debates concerning the constitutional organization of the Latin kingdom, the relationship between the Frankish crusaders and the Muslim and eastern Christian populations over whom they ruled, and the "colonial" character of the Latin settlements.**HIST 7110 (4) PSM: Church Law and Medieval Society (Mueller)****Call#27619, M 5:30 - 8 p.m.**

The course will consist of a two-semester pro-seminar/seminar sequence inviting graduate students to formulate and pursue original research projects in the field of medieval church law. Possible study questions may address a wide range of issues, including legal theory and judicial practice, contemporary uses and perceptions of 'canonical justice'. The pro-seminar will be devoted to becoming familiar with the bibliography and tools available for original investigations into the subject. It will also assist students in defining their own research topics. The seminar in the spring of 2016 will provide a forum for the presentation, discussion, and refinement of each participant's scholarly work, which should eventually result in a 30 to 50-page essay.**PHIL 7039 (3) Aquinas's Philosophy of God (Davies)**

Call#27183, W 7 - 9 p.m.

Aquinas is often, and rightly, taken to be a theologian who assumes that certain truths have to be revealed to us by God since we lack the ability to demonstrate them. But he also engaged in what is commonly called 'natural theology' - i.e. philosophical argumentation aiming to prove that there is some knowledge of God to be attained by human reason. In this course we shall be looking at Aquinas's natural theology, chiefly as presented in his Summa Theologiae, but also as we find it in his Summa Contra Gentiles. We shall see how Aquinas approaches the notion of natural theology in general. We shall then see how Aquinas argues for certain conclusions concerning the existence and nature of God. Given the importance of natural theology for Aquinas's philosophy as a whole, and given the fact that Aquinas draws on metaphysical notions scattered throughout his writings, the course will provide a serious introduction to Aquinas's thinking in general. This will be primarily a lecture course, but will include class discussions. Partly to stimulate them, numerous comparisons and contrasts will be made between what Aquinas has to say and what other philosophers have argued since early modern times. The course will relate Aquinas's natural theology to that of other thinkers, including contemporary analytical ones. This course can satisfy for either the medieval requirement or for the contemporary analytical one. This course will not require a knowledge of Latin, and it will not presuppose any previous familiarity with the thinking of Aquinas or that of any other medieval philosopher.**THEO 5300 (3/4) History of Christianity I (Lienhard)**

Call#27136, W 5 - 7:30 p.m.

The history of the doctrines and theology of Christianity from New Testament times to A.D. 1500. Topics treated are the canon of the Bible, the Trinity, the Person of Christ, grace and predestination, and the presence of Christ in the Eucharist. To accompany this study, books by some classic authors will be read: Jean Leclercq, Joseph Pieper, Etienne Gilson, and others, along with W. H. C. Frend's The Rise of Christianity.**THEO 6305 (3) Introduction to Rabbinic Literature (Gribetz)**

Call#27133, T 1 - 3:30 p.m.

In this course, students will explore the vast corpus of rabbinic literature and the historical, intellectual, religious, social, legal and political circumstances in which rabbinic Judaism developed in Palestine and Babylonia between the first and seventh centuries C.E. Students will gain experience reading different genres of rabbinic texts; become familiar with cutting-edge scholarship in the field; experiment with various methodologies in the study of late antiquity; and learn about a formative period in Jewish history. The course will cover a range of topics, including biblical exegesis, the development of tradition, the relationship between law and literature, inter-religious tolerance and conflict, scholasticism, women/gender/sexuality, interactions between lay and religious authorities, the development of ritual, the transmission of oral and written texts, manuscripts, and reception history. The course is designed to train graduate students in a range of disciplines and fields - theology, history, literature, law, classics, medieval studies, women and gender - to be able to use rabbinic sources and methodologies developed in the field of rabbinics in their own research. The texts will be taught in translation, with optional additional sessions for those interested in reading in the original Hebrew and Aramaic.**THEO 6463 (3) From Lollards to Luther (Hornbeck)****Call#27137, R 9 - 11:30 a.m.**

The period between the outbreak of the Black Death and the emergence of Martin Luther, Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin, and others as leaders of a new "Reformation" was a period of great diversity and contestation in Western Christianity. In this course, we will explore the theology, spirituality, and ecclesio-political ramifications of several reform "movements" in the later middle ages. Our focus will fall primarily on the Lollard or Wycliffite controversies of late medieval England, on fifteenth-century phenomena like conciliarism and the Modern-Day Devout, and on the early Lutheran Reformation, but broader themes (women, preaching, soteriology, academic life, heresy and inquisition) will be treated throughout the semester.**FREN 5090 (0) French for Reading (TBA)**

**MVST 5078 (4) Meditation, Contemplation, and the Spiritual Senses**

Call #25015 (Albin and Davis); W 5 - 7:30 p.m.The late Middle Ages saw an astonishing proliferation of texts, practices, and styles of devotion seeking to draw human beings closer to God through the body. New emphasis on Christ's humanity and Aristotelian natural philosophy prompted the rediscovery of the five corporeal senses and their cognitive processes in devotional literature. In this course, we will examine the languages, knowledge, desires, and anxieties surrounding the senses in a diverse corpus of texts, probing them for their theological import as much as for their literary design. Major authors: Aristotle, Augustine, Origen, Hugh of St. Victor, Bonaventure, Richard Rolle, Chaucer, Margery Kempe, Meditations Vitae Christi.

**ENGL 5261 (3) Sir Thomas Malory: Political, Religious, and Literary Cultures of the Fifteenth Century**

Call #25016 (Wogan-Browne); T 5:30 - 8:30 p.m.Malorys vast Morte Darthur and the wide multilingual reading that went into it is both object of study and the gateway into the troubled fifteenth century in this course. After relative critical neglect, the fifteenth century is now increasingly studied, often as part of rethinking early modern and late medieval periods. Clerical literary production of religious devotion and controversy, and interest in medieval neo-classicism and early modern humanism as an area of book history have been two of the main drivers of renewed attention. Malory is best known as the writer of one of the most enduring and most loved Arthurian works in English, but this course seeks to take a fresh look at Morte Darthur by not making Arthurian literature its framing concern. Instead, the course looks at Morte Darthur as a work of secular culture composed within a period of richly various literary production amidst political and ideological crisis. Malorys representation of political stability and governance, of conquest and other internal and foreign relations, treason law, and chivalry investments in Eucharistic theology will be some of the issues explored in this wider context, alongside questions of manuscript-print interrelations, the valence of secular and sacred chivalric discourses, and the challenges posed by Malorys powerful and sometimes puzzling work to various conceptions of literary form. Reception, both in terms of the audiences for Malorys text and modern critical paradigms for Morte Darthur will also inform these explorations. No prerequisites (Malorys French sources can be read in translation on this course).

**HIST 6076 (4) Noble Culture and Society**

Call #25885 (Paul); M 5 - 7:30 p.m.The world of High Medieval Europe was politically, economically, and culturally dominated by a new kind of aristocracy, one whose special status was based on a combination of landholding, military dominance, exclusive bloodlines, and elaborate performances. The group who we designate as "nobility" shaped the medieval political landscape, just as often acting as the avowed enemies of the centralizing monarchies as they were its agents and the beneficiaries of the royal policies that enshrined their status and privileges in law. The nobility were also the primary patrons and consumers of courtly culture. They wrote law and poetry and spoke often of the laws of love. They were the nurturers of religious reform and dissent: some were crusaders, some heretics, and some both. This course will explore the recent scholarship on the nobility. Among other topics, we will explore the arguments surrounding the supposed feudal and familial crises that created the noble class, the meaning and exercise of violence by the aristocracy, the social function of courtliness, the relationship between chivalry and religious belief, and the response of the nobility to the threat of rising centralized government and the emergence of a wealthy merchant class in the later middle ages. We will read poetry, family histories, devotional texts, and knightly biography and consider art objects, landscape, and architecture.

**HIST 8070 (4) Medieval Intellectual Cultures**

Call #26848 (Novikoff); R 5:30 - 8 p.m.This course is a continuation of the pro-seminar from the previous semester. The course takes a broad approach to medieval intellectual history, focusing not just on the texts and ideas that were central to medieval intellectual life but also on the cultural conditions that enabled scholarship and creativity to flourish. Students enrolled in the seminar will under ordinary circumstance have taken the first part of the seminar/pro-seminar and be expected to work on a research paper of substantial size. Seminars will be principally devoted to discussing additional historiographical and methodological issues that arise from the study of medieval intellectual and cultural history.

**PHIL 5010 (3) Introduction to St. Thomas Aquinas**

Call #18395 (Klima); T 11 a.m.- 1 p.m.

This course will be a general introduction to Aquinas' philosophical thinking. We shall pay special attention to his philosophy of God. We shall also turn to what he says about questions such as the scope of human knowledge, the nature of the human being, and the nature and significance of human action. As well as being expository, the course will consider the cogency of Aquinas' position on various topics. It will also try to relate what Aquinas says to what other philosophers, especially modern philosophers, have had to say. The course will not presuppose any previous detailed knowledge of Aquinas on the part of students.**PHIL 5012 (3) Introduction to St. Augustine**

Call #18396 (Cullen); R 2:30 - 4:30 p.m.

At the age of nineteen a young man living in Roman north Africa discovered philosophy. The world has never been the same since. While the world of the late Roman Empire a world known for its decadence and brutality teetered on the brink of collapse all about him, this teenager gave himself wholeheartedly to the pursuit of wisdom; he developed into one of greatest philosophical geniuses of all time a genius who did more to shape the thought and culture of the next millennium of history than perhaps any other single individual. This course is a survey of the philosophy of this singularly influential intellectual Augustine of Hippo. The course will begin by discussing Augustine's life, from his tumultuous and lurid youth in the streets of Carthage to his deathbed where he lay dying while the barbarians were literally at the gates. The course will discuss his intellectual struggle with Gnostic Manicheanism and skepticism. Attention will be given to the philosophical currents that shaped Augustine, especially Neo-platonism. The course will follow Augustine on his inner journey into the depths of the human soul. In addition to his teachings on being and truth, the course will examine his philosophy of education and his history-making intervention in the centuries-long battle between Socrates and the Sophists. The last section of the course will focus on Augustines ethical and political ideas. Particular attention will be given to those seminal doctrines that have had a pervasive influence, such as his teachings on society, the political order, war, and his philosophy of history.**PHIL 6460 (3) Intentionality**

Call #24988 (Klima); F 11 a.m. - 1 p.m.

It will also explore the methodological relevance of these theoretical shifts for the study of pre-modern Christianity/historical theology.**THEO 6425 (3) Augustine in Context**

Call #24977(M. Tilley) M 9 - 11:30 a.m.

This course investigates the life and writings of Augustine of Hippo in the context of late antiquity including philosophical and religious influences upon him as well as the controversies and archeological remains of his ministry**THEO 6444 (3) Medieval Modernisms**

Call #24980 (Moore); T 4 - 6:30 p.m.

In twentieth-century Europe, an astonishing range of intellectuals were animated and energized by the study of pre modern and early modern Christianity. For theologians, historians, philosophers, and literary figures, Christian medieval and patristic sources were galvanizing forces of transformation, and harbingers of ethical, theological, and political renewal. This course investigates the various appropriations of medieval and ancient Christianity from the Catholic nouvelle theologie movement (Henri de Lubac, Yves Congar, MD Chenu, and Jean Danielou in particular), literature (Charles Peguy), philosophy, and historiography (Michel de Certeau), along with secondary works by Amy Hollywood and others.**Ital 5090 (0) Italian for Reading**

This course examines and evaluates the interaction among the three religious cultures of medieval Iberia: Christian, Muslim, and Jewish. Readings and discussion will cover the successive historical periods of medieval Iberia (ca. 600-1500), but a major focus of the class will be a holistic approach to intellectual traditions and cultural interactions among the three groups. To this end, a substantial amount of attention will be devoted to considering the architectural, poetic, musical, and polemical interactions that shaped the countries we now call Spain and Portugal. This class will also take advantage of New York's exceptional museum and library collections.**HIST 8999 (4) Tutorial: Study Tour of Medieval Spain**

(Myers) (TBA)

One of the great medieval pilgrimage routes, the Camino de Santiago crosses northern Spain from the passes of the Pyrenees to Santiago de Compostela. This study-tour will consider the legends of the Camino, some of its many surviving monuments, and the modern revival of the pilgrimage by walking for two weeks with the peregrinos/-as from Leon to Santiago de Compostela. This class will meet periodically at Fordham before the walk to discuss reading assignments and prepare. A journal is required at the end of the course.

**MVST 5070 (4) Manuscript Culture**

Call #24287 (Hafner) F; 1 - 3:30 p.m.

This course will examine manuscript culture from the third through the fifteenth centuries, with particular attention to questions of textual transmission and illuminated adornment. Issues examined will include: the principles, materials, and study of medieval manuscripts and primary documents; the problems of evaluation of the cultural contexts of their production and use; manuscript illumination; the resources of codicology and palaeography; the preparation and evaluation of modern editions; the assessment of readership and patronage; philology and the materialism of the Middle Ages; or the development of libraries. The course will include visits to local manuscript libraries, such as Special Collections at Walsh Library, Rare Books and Manuscripts at Columbia University, the Rare Book Collection of the NY Public Library, and the Morgan Library. Students will have the opportunity to do hands-on work with primary sources. Their final projects will be tailored to their research areas and expertise and must be based on the study of an original manuscript.**ENGL 5208 (3) The English Language 1154-1776**

Call #23921 (Chase); M 2:30 - 5 p.m.

This course will deal with the linguistics and sociolinguistics of Middle English and Early Modern English. The beginning date, 1154, is the year of the last entry in the*Anglo-Saxon Chronicle*and the year Henry II, the first Angevin king, acceded to the throne. It is as good a date as any to mark the demise of Old English and the beginning of the Middle English period. 1776, the year of the American Declaration of Independence, marks another turning point, when Early Modern English began to become the English(es) of the present day. This course, which should be of special interest to students of medieval and early modern literature, will examine the ways in which the language developed from the twelfth through the eighteenth centuries. Topics will include dialects and standardization, lexicon, grammar and syntax, phonological change (The Great Vowel Shift), stress and prosody, palaeography and codicology of Middle English manuscripts, and early printing, all with an aim to better understanding and appreciating the literature of these periods.**ENGL 5264 (3) Chaucer**

Call #24265 (Yeager); R 2:30 - 5 p.m.

This course is an introduction to Geoffrey Chaucers poetry as well as to trends in medieval literary criticism. By reading Chaucers*The Canterbury Tales*, the*Troilus*, and selections from his mid-length and shorter poems, we will touch on some of the concerns that have animated Chaucer studies: Chaucers representation of the social world, religion, gender, and the self. Any analysis of Chaucers writing implicitly or explicitly raises a question about the most responsible approach to texts that are now over 600 years old. Indeed, this question has remained constant since the beginning of Chaucer studies. We will, therefore, be very interested in what it has meant and what it means now to read Chaucer historically. Discussion will also be animated by our exploration of Chaucers continued dialogue with his sources. No prior knowledge of Middle English or medieval history is assumed; however, most of the primary readings will be offered in Chaucers highly accessible dialect of Middle English. The course aims to develop close reading and recitation skills in Middle English, as it raises students awareness of Chaucers status as a poet in a triglossic society. Because Chaucer is so commonly associated with a medievalists teaching expectations on the job market, we will also explore aspects of syllabus and undergraduate teaching design. It is recommended that those who are unfamiliar with this period look at Maurice Keens*English Society in the Later Middle Ages*or May McKisacks*The Fourteenth Century*before the class begins.**HIST 6153 (4) Medieval Society and Economy**

Call #24653 (Kowaleksi); T 4 - 6:30 p.m.

This course explores major themes in the social and economic history of medieval Europe, including the impact of the barbarian migrations, technology and social change, agriculture and rural life, the commercial revolution, the Black Death, social revolts, craft guilds and the textile industry, and changing notions of poverty and charity, among other topics. The different methodological approaches to these issues will also be highlighted in examining not only schools of history (such as the Annales school, neo-Marxism, and prosopography) but also the contributions of other disciplinary approaches, including archaeology, demography, environmental science, historical geography, and numismatics.**HIST 7070 (4) PSM: Med Intellectual Cultures**

Call #24925 (Novikoff); W 5 - 7:30 p.m.

This pro-seminar takes a broad approach to medieval intellectual history, focusing not just on the texts and ideas that were central to medieval intellectual life but also on the cultural conditions that enabled scholarship and creativity to flourish. Beginning with the late antique absorption of classical learning and the formation of a monastic tradition, the course will deal successively with the deep impact of the Augustinian tradition, the Carolingian renewal, the conflicts between Church and State that erupted during the investiture controversy, the classicizing tendencies and innovative ideas of the twelfth-century renaissance, the golden age of scholasticism and the medieval university, and the various crises of authority that reshaped Europe on the eve of the Reformation and before the invention of print. A particular concern of the class will be with the history of the liberal arts and the evolution of teaching practices.**PHIL 7076 (3) Metaphysical Themes in Duns Scotus**

Call #23845 (Pini); M 5:30 - 7:30 p.m.

John Duns Scotus (1308) is commonly recognized as having made a major contribution to Western metaphysics, but because his works are quite technical, they are read only rarely by a limited number of specialists. In this course, students will study and discuss some key texts concerning topics such as being, substance, essence, and individuation. The course will devote much attention to historical context but the ultimate goal will be to assess Scotus's positions and arguments from a philosophical point of view.**THEO 6360 (3) Alexandrian Theology**

Call #23854 (Lienhard); M 5:15 - 7:45 p.m.

This course will focus on reading and interpretation of selected writings of Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Athanasius, Didymus the Blind, and Cyril of Alexandria, against the background of the pagan and Jewish traditions of Alexandria.**THEO 6196 (3) Early Christian Ritual (3)**

Call #23852 (Peppard); M 9:30 - 11:30 a.m.

This graduate seminar surveys the evidence for ritual practices in the first few centuries of Christianity. Through engagement with theoretical literature on ritual and identity formation, we will explore what can be known about early Christian practices and interrogate our means of knowing it. Much of the course will focus on the rituals of initiation and their diverse interpretations in ancient sources, but other topics will be covered as time allows. Prior study of early Christian history is recommended.**THEO 6367 (3) Byzantine Christianity: History and Theology**

Call #23858 (Demacopoulos); W 11:45 a.m. - 2:15 p.m.

This graduate-level survey course introduces students to the theological ideas and historical transitions that captivated the minds of Eastern Christians from the 8th to the 15th centuries. Through a careful reading of primary sources (in English translation) and the scholarly debates about those sources, we will explore the Iconoclastic controversies, the expansion of Christianity to the Slavs, the experience of Christians living under Islamic authority, and a host of issues related to rupture between Eastern and Western Christianity. In most circumstances, successful completion of this course authorizes doctoral students in Theology to teach the undergraduate cognate course.**FREN 5090 (0) French for Reading**

**MVST 5078 (4) Medieval Books and Materials**

Call #22183 (Gyug); W 5 - 7:30 p.m.

The handwritten sources of the medieval period, whether records, chronicles, treatises, Bibles, or many other genres and types, are fundamental materials for medieval studies. Using examples from a range of documentary and literary sources, the course will consider the purposes, preparation, transmission, and preservation of written sources from the period. The emphasis will be on how such materials can be used for medieval studies and the tools important for their study.**ENGL 6216 (3) Late Medieval Autobiography: T. Hoccleve, O. Bokenham, M. Kempe**

Call #22514 (Erler); M 2:30 - 5 p.m.

Margery Kempe's*Book*is often called the first female autobiography in English but the writing of her fifteenth-century contemporaries Thomas Hoccleve, a London scribe and bureaucrat, and Osbern Bokenham, an East Anglian friar, also offer a personal voice. We will explore the social and theological context of each author as we read their work in Middle English.**ENGL 6250 (3) Postcolonial Middle Ages**

Call #22515 (Yeager); R 2:30 - 5 p.m.

Postcolonial study has been a productive scholarly approach for decades. But the accuracy of the term, postcolonial, with reference to pre-modern literature, has been on ongoing subject of debate. According to accepted, critical definitions, postcolonial literatures are products of colonizing communities and previously colonized cultures, rising in the wake of periods of colonization; moreover, postcolonial study has been linked to modern European communities which formed global empires. These expectations and others have made the postcolonial Middle Ages appear controversial. In spite of these controversies, productive understanding of pre-modern culture has emerged from research under the postcolonial lens, encouraging the study of displaced cultures, and of minority and subjugated voices within the medieval period, the production and performance of identity, and the ways in which communities define, remember, and perpetuate themselves. This course will focus on medieval texts produced in England, France, and the Levant under changing pre-modern regimes, and will explore the varied literary responses to colonization, diaspora, and displacement that occurred long before the Age of Empire. Texts to be read in Middle English include the Croxton*Play of the Sacrament*, Geoffrey Chaucers*Man of Laws Tale*and*Prioress's Tale*, along with pre-modern work in translation, such as*The Letter of Prester John*, the Beauvais*Play of Daniel*, the*Chanson de Roland*, and Fulcher of Chartres history. These works offer complex views of alterity, conquest, place, space, and performance which are foundational in discussing how the Middle Ages can be viewed as postcolonial.**HIST 5201 (4) Twelfth Century Renaissance**

Call #22485 (Novikoff); R 5:30 - 8 p.m.

This seminar examines the renaissance of the twelfth century from multiple historiographical angles: as a medieval "renaissance" in the sense famously popularized by Charles Homer Haskins in 1927, as a "reformation" or "European revolution" formulated by historians of religion in the later twentieth century, and as a "long twelfth century" preferred by cultural historians today. Readings of secondary and select primary sources will cover a wide range of ideas, institutions, and personalities associated with intellectual life (broadly conceived) from Anselm of Canterbury to the first universities. Participants will be invited in writing assignments and discussions to challenge older paradigms, introduce new ones, and consider alternate and cross-disciplinary approaches to studying this enduringly fascinating epoch in medieval civilization**HIST 8150 (4) Seminar: Medieval England**

Call #22491 (Kowaleski); T 4 - 6:30 p.m.

Students continue to work on the research project they defined in the Proseminar to this course. They also learn to design and use a computer database that includes data gathered in the course of research on the final paper, participate in seminars to improve their academic writing and public speaking skills, and familiarize themselves with professional standards for writing a scholarly article, giving a talk at an academic conference, and writing an academic*curriculum vitae*. They complete the seminar by giving a 20-minute conference paper on their research project and writing a thesis-length original research paper that could be published as a scholarly article.**LATN 6521 (3) Latin Palaeography**

Call #23011 (Clark); F 4 - 6 p.m.

From Script to Print: A study of the development of Latin handwriting from Antiquity to the Renaissance. Includes a study of the manuscript as book (codicology) and as cultural artifact. Some consideration of textual transmission and critical editing. There will be hands-on practice in reading the various scripts. Weekly transcriptions, some outside reading, a final examination, and a final palaeographical project are course requirements. The final project will involve transcribing and identifying an original manuscript leaf from the Fordham collection, although advanced students, with specific needs, may, with permission, develop their own final palaeographical projects.**PHIL 5010 (3) Introduction to St. Thomas Aquinas Call # 18395 (Davies) M 7 - 9 p.m.**

**MVST 5050 (4) World of Late Antiquity: History, Art, Culture**

Call #20959 (McFadden and Sogno) W 5 - 7:30 p.m.

The legacy of Gibbons masterpiece "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" has exercised a great and lasting influence on the way in which the world of Late Antiquity is perceived and presented, but the work of Peter Brown and other scholars has offered a powerful alternative to the Gibbonian narrative of inevitable decline. The two opposing concepts of "crisis" and "transformation" now co-exist as interpretive frameworks in the flourishing field of Late Antiquity and continue to inspire thought-provoking studies about this fascinating and enigmatic period, which defies easy explanation. This course offers an introduction to the Late Antique world by surveying the History, Art, and Culture of the Roman Empire from the third to the sixth century. We shall analyze both primary sources and monuments and examine critically the secondary literature that studies them.**ENGL 6215 (3) Medieval British Historical Writing**

Call # 21970 (O'Donnell) M 2:30 - 5 p.m.

History-writing was fundamental to medieval and early-modern literary sensibilities, but in its relation to truth, genre, and identity, medieval history differs dramatically from contemporary understandings of the discipline of history. This course will introduce you to the major historiographical thinkers and practitioners of the English Middle Ages and include selections from Gildas, Bede, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Dudo of Saint-Quentin, Geoffrey of Monmouth, Matthew Paris, and the Middle English*Brut*.**ENGL 5216 (3) Three Medieval Embodiments**

Call # 21963 (Albin) M 5:30 - 7 p.m.

In this course, we will explore three models of human embodiment (theological, medical and musical) available to the high and late English Middle Ages; we will examine how writers, doctors, artists, and musicians gave expression to those models, we will locate and interrogate the places they overlap, interweave, and fall apart; and we will challenge ourselves to imagine how they constituted alternative modes of embodied experience in the world. To reach these goals, we will cast a wide net and study diverse primary sources drawn from philosophy, medicine, theology, drama, poetry, music, and visual art alongside secondary sources in historical phenomenology, cultural studies, and performance theory. Major authors/texts include: Bernardus Silvestris (*Cosmographia*), Chaucer, Second Shepherds Play, Aristotle (*De anima*), the*Trotula*, Boethius (*Consolatio philosophiae*and*De institutione musica*). All readings in English or Middle English.**HIST 6078 (4) The Crusader States: The Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem 1099-1291**

In addition, we will engage with the major historiographical debates concerning the constitutional organization of the Latin kingdom, the relationship between the Frankish crusaders and the Muslim and eastern Christian populations over whom they ruled, and the colonial character of the Latin settlements.**HIST 7150 (4) Proseminar: Medieval England**

Call #21564 (Kowaleski) T 4 - 6:30 p.m.

This is the first half of a year-long course that focuses on the social, economic, and administrative history of England from the eleventh through fifteenth centuries. Special emphasis is placed upon 1) how to identify and exploit a wide variety of primary sources (such as wills, cartularies, court rolls, account rolls, chronicles, among others); 2) how to use major historical collections (such as Rolls Series, VCH, Record Commissioners, Royal Historical Manuscripts Commission, the Ordnance Survey, Selden Society, and others); and 3) gaining an awareness of the regions and landscape of medieval England, as well as the contributions of historical geography. Besides treating thematic issues such as the church and society, law and legal system, the growth of government and administration, maritime trade and industry in town and country, the weekly discussions will also consider the society and economy of the peasantry, townspeople, and the landowning elite.**PHIL 7071 (3) Aquinas: Questions on God in Summa Theologiae**

Ancient Christians in North Africa developed more sophisticated theologies than their contemporaries in Rome. Terms for the Trinity and the sacramental character imprinted on the soul come from Africa, as does the saying "Outside the Church there is no salvation." This course introduces students to the physical and cultural environment of early Christian communities in North Africa and to the theologies Africans produced between the origins of African Christianity in the second century and the Middle Ages. Subjects include Tertullian, Cyprian, stories of martyrs and literature of the Donatist controversy (with Augustine).

**MVST 5035 (4) Writing East: Outremer and Identity in the Middle Ages****Call # 20401 (Paul and Yeager) FMH 416 R 2:30 - 5 p.m.**

As the stage for the central events of the Gospel narrative, the lands of the eastern shore of the Mediterranean long occupied a central place in the collective imagination of Latin western Europe. Over the course of the Middle Ages, however, increasingly frequent encounters resulting from trade, pilgrimage, and crusade not only enriched the European image of the East, but vastly enhanced the significance to how medieval Christians approached the Other. This course will trace the rise of a discourse of difference centered in what was called, in England and France, Outremer, the land beyond the sea. Together with medieval literary productions, histories, letters, and travel narratives, we will read works from the growing body of scholarship on this important topic.**ENGL 6239 (3) French of England III**

Among the debates to be explored are the effect on medieval society of the Christian Church's teachings on virginity, sex, and marriage, and the influence of geography (northern vs Mediterranean Europe), environment (village, town, and convent), and status (noble, bourgeois, or peasant) on the work, family role, and authority of women. Chronologically the course will range from the early Christian period to the Renaissance. Recent scholarly work on nuns, mystics, and beguines will be examined, and readings will also cover different approaches to the study of women and family, including the methodologies of literary scholars, demographers, feminists, and legal historians.**HIST 8025 (4) SEM: Medieval Religious Cultures**

Call # 20579 (Moore) TBD T 4 - 6:30 p.m.

In twentieth-century Europe, the study of pre-modern and early modern Christianity energized an astonishing range of intellectuals, across the ideological and disciplinary spectrums. For theologians, historians, philosophers, and literary figures, Christian medieval and patristic sources were galvanizing forces of transformation, and harbingers of ethical, theological, and political renewal. This course investigates the various appropriations of medieval and ancient Christianity from*la**nouvelle theologie*movement (Henri de Lubac, M.D. Chenu, and Jean Danilou in particular), the Catholic literary revival (Charles Peguy, Georges Bernanos), philosophy, (Hannah Arendt, Michel Foucault, and Julia Kristeva), and historiography (Michel de Certeau), along with secondary works by Amy Hollywood and others.**THEO 6464 (3) From Lollards to Luther**
