# Graduate Essay Prize Recipients

### Since 2000, the Center has awarded two annual essay prizes to graduate students who produce a paper in a course in one of the Center's participating departments. Two judges, often drawn from the visiting medieval fellows or affiliated faculty, assess the essays, which are nominated by graduate faculty instructors. The First-Year Essay Prize is awarded to a paper, no longer than 25 pages, that is written on a medieval topic by a graduate student in their first year of study. The Joseph O'Callaghan Essay Prize goes to an essay of any length written by a graduate student on a medieval topic.
