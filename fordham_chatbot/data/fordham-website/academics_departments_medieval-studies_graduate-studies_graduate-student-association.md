# Medieval Studies Graduate Student Association

A resource available to all graduate students at Fordham is the[ Graduate Student Association](https://fordhamgsa.blogspot.com/) (GSA). The GSA is a student-run organization dedicated to promoting academic excellence and student solidarity among the departments of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Your GSA representative is responsible for helping students obtain funding for conferences or other projects, orienting incoming students, and organizing social events. Please feel free to contact your GSA representative if you have any questions about the Medieval Studies program or the GSA.
