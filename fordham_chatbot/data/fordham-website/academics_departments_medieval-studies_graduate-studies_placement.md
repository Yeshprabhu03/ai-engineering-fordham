We recently tracked 100 of our [MA graduates in Medieval Studies:](/academics/departments/medieval-studies/graduate-studies/alumni/)

*45% of the MA graduates went on to PhD work, a much higher percentage than for most MA programs. About half went into doctoral programs at Fordham, but others went to such universities as Berkeley, Cambridge (UK), Columbia, CUNY, Kentucky, Michigan, Northwestern, Notre Dame, Ohio State, Pennsylvania, Tennessee-Knoxville, Texas-Austin, Toronto, and Yale, and the University of New Mexico, among others.

*17% of the MA graduates pursued other post-graduate degrees in another field, such as Business, Divinity, Education, Law, and, especially Library Science.

In 2014, these 100 graduates were pursuing these career options:

- 22% were still in Ph.D. programs
- 15% were in some sort of business field (half of these were in IT)
- 14% were high-school teachers (including two administrators)
- 13% had their Ph.D.s and were teaching or working in university administration
- 12% were writers, rare book dealers, or in publishing
- 10% had their Ph.D.s and were teaching at the college level
- 9% were working librarians
- 6% were in legal careers
- 5% were in non-profit administration
- 4% were artists or in arts/museum administration

To help our student medievalists understand the options open to them, the Center runs a [Compatible Careers Workshop](/academics/departments/medieval-studies/graduate-studies/medieval-studies-careers/) each April, when we bring back alumni to discuss how the skills they acquired as medievalist graduate students can be transferred to non-academic careers.
