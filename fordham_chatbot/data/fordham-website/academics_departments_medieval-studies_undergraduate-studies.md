The Medieval Studies major explores the legacy of the Middle Ages, a period central to our understanding of both the past and the present. Through interdisciplinary study of medieval art, history, language, literature, music and ways of thought and religion, students develop an integrated understanding of medieval civilization.

Medieval Studies majors and minors have the opportunity to pursue independent [research](/academics/departments/medieval-studies/undergraduate-studies/research/) in a variety of ways, including an Honors thesis, a tutorial, or helping a faculty member with his or her research. There are also opportunities to work on one of the Center's digital projects.

### Senior Thesis Option

The program offers a senior thesis option in Medieval Studies for senior Medieval Studies majors with a 3.0 GPA or higher in Medieval Studies who wish to complete an ambitious project under the direction of a faculty member.

If you are interested, you should discuss this option with the undergraduate chair of Medieval Studies, as well as with a potential faculty adviser, and then submit an application to be evaluated by the undergraduate chair and potential advisor prior to the semester in which the thesis will be completed. To write a thesis in the spring semester, you must submit the application by October 15 of the previous semester; to write a thesis in the fall semester, you must submit the application by March 1 of the previous semester. If your application is approved, the undergraduate chair will authorize you to register for MVST 4997: Medieval Studies Senior Thesis Tutorial, which counts as an elective toward the major (but will not replace any major requirements). You will write your thesis over the course of one semester, at the end of which there will be a defense of the thesis with the adviser and one program reader.
