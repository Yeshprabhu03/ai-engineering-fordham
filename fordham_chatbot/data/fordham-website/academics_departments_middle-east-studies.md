Few parts of our world are more in the news or more vital to the international interests of the United States. Business, mass media, law firms, governmental and non-governmental bodies, philanthropic organizations, relief and aid agencies, human rights groups, graduate and professional schools are all eager to recruit individuals well-versed in the complexities and intricacies of Middle Eastern/North African culture, history, religion, civilization, economics and politics.

Fordham University is one of the few institutions of higher learning in the United States that offers an interdisciplinary, intercampus, undergraduate major in Middle Eastern studies. This program trains and equips students to step into challenging positions related to Middle East affairs.

### The Program

Includes the geographic areas of the Middle East and North Africa from ancient to modern times, from Morocco in the west to Afghanistan in the east, as well as from Turkey in the north to Somalia in the south. We offer courses in history, anthropology, political science, art history, economics, religion, philosophy, and literature. All of these disciplinary areas are necessary to make the Middle East and North Africa come alive with meaning.
