# Middle East Studies Goals and Assessment

Majors and Minors in Middle East Studies will demonstrate:

- an appreciation of the value of interdisciplinary work in Middle East Studies;
- an ability to contextualize attitudes towards the cultural, religious, historical, and political dynamics of Middle Eastern regions;
- the necessary linguistic and critical skills to work in professions connected with the Middle East, or Middle Eastern Studies.

These skills will be assessed in the [capstone senior seminar: MEST 4001](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/search/?P=MEST%204001).
