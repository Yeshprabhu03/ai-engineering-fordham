## Associate Professor Michael Peppard Interview with Public Radio International (PRI)

Associate Professor Michael Peppard was interviewed for PRI “The World” on Friday, January 22, for the story “[ISIS wants to erase the Middle East’s Christian history — and make a few bucks along the way](http://www.pri.org/stories/2016-01-22/isis-wants-erase-middle-east-s-christian-history-and-make-few-bucks-along-way).” Text and audio for the interview can be found below. Professor Peppard also had his article,”Is this the Oldest Image of the Virgin Mary?” published in yesterday’s *New York Times* Sunday Review Section. It’s a version of one of the arguments from his new book, *The World’s Oldest Church* (Yale 2016).
