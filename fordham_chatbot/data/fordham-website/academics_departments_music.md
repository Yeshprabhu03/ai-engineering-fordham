We acknowledge that Fordham University occupies the unceded land of the Lenni-Lenape and the Wappinger Peoples. As a community dedicated to the ideals of Jesuit education, Fordham aspires to show appreciation, respect, and concern for all Peoples of this land. We acknowledge the long and complex history that has brought us to reside on this land, and we seek to evaluate the ongoing effects of settler colonialism and our participation in that process. We remember the Indigenous Peoples’ connection to this region and appreciate the opportunity to live, learn, and pray in their traditional homeland. We honor the Lenape Elders and other Indigenous Caretakers of these lands and waters before us, the Indigenous Peoples today, and the generations to come.
