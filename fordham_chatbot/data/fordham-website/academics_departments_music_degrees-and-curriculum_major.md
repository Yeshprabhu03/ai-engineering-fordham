# Music Major

## Our music major is a liberal arts degree

- It is available both at Fordham College at Rose Hill and Fordham College at Lincoln Center
- Covers a range of courses that include music theory, performance, and history
- Leads to a BA in music
- Is an academically oriented program, focusing on the study of the history of music as a humanistic discipline

**Students who pursue the major can go on to:**

- Graduate studies in musicology, ethnomusicology, and composition, music education, music therapy, performance degrees
- Jobs in music or careers that combine music with other disciplines

*No Auditions Required*

### Double Majors

The music major can be combined with other courses of study. Approximately 50% of our music majors have a double major. A music major can go on to a career in the music industry or in arts management, for example, and might consider taking economics or business courses related to the arts. Fordham's Gabelli School of Business offers a minor in business that can be combined with the music major. Some of the most common majors combined with music are:

- Computer Science
- Biological Science
- Psychology
- English
- History
- American Studies
- Math
- Philosphy
- Natural Science

### Music Internships

Music majors can receive credit for a music internship with a recording company or concert agency in New York City during their junior or seniors years. With the approval and supervision of the department, majors may receive elective credit for one internship (MUSC 4951-MUSC 4954) graded on a pass/fail basis.
