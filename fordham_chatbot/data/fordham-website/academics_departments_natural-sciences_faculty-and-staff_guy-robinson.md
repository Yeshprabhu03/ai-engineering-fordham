Paleoecology is the science of learning about ecosystems and environments of the distant past. Much of the paleoecological work at Fordham examines the proposition that our Paleolithic ancestors caused the extinction of the largest land animals late in the last Ice Age. To explore this controversial question, students and I take cores out of lakes and bogs, which we then divide up as a time sequence to extract fossil pollen, spores and microscopic charcoal. Whenever our coring equipment drives into the muck and mud of a wetland, we are on our way back to the Ice Age. With radiocarbon dates we piece together narratives of environmental change, landscape fire, large animal density, and human arrival on the prehistoric landscapes of New York and elsewhere. Mastodons and other extinct animals are occasionally uncovered by local farmers. These “lucky accidents” make for great opportunities to go out and get sediment samples from actual fossil sites. All of this helps us better understand the circumstances of the last mass extinction on earth. So far, we have found that populations of charismatic animals began to crash more than 1000 years before the rapid climate shifts marking the end of the last ice age. Our pollen and microfossil records also indicate that humans had entered the New York area by 14,000 years ago, several centuries before the archaeological record begins.

The other side of our work is to measure current atmospheric pollen; what’s in the air from day to day is a matter of public health. Fordham operates the only certified aeroallergen monitoring station in New York City and another in Armonk, in the northern suburbs. I manage both these stations, and am currently collaborating with a doctoral student at Mailman School of Public Health. With help from the NYC Dept of Health, we have been able to show that allergy medication sales at New York City pharmacies will increase sharply just after a peak in our pollen counts of certain tree species. In a related project to discover the geographic variability in airborne pollen distribution across the City throughout the year, we have built and deployed 55 passive pollen traps attached to street poles throughout the five boroughs.

Fordham students working on fossil and modern pollen projects usually do this during the summer months, when they will often be joined by high school and graduate students from other institutions.
