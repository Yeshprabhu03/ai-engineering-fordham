My primary research is in the Learning Sciences and Educational Philosophy. In particular, my research focuses on understanding what competent scientific reasoning looks like in both professional and civic settings. Methodologically, I study people and communities and have done so in a variety of contexts including professional workplaces, academic communities, civic communities, and science classrooms. The overall goal of this research is to inform science curriculum targets, learning environment design, and collaborative artificial intelligence tools.

Current projects include:

- Unpacking interactions between mechanistic, epistemic, and intuitive reasoning.
- Scaffolding students’ problematizing of science knowledge.
- Developing learning progressions around ecosystems and socioscientific reasoning.
- Developing an integrative model of experiential and service learning.
- Characterizing needed scaffolds in experiential learning.
- Build upon AI models to better scaffold engagement with science.
