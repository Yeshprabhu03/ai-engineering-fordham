I received my undergraduate degree in Biology from Stony Brook University, my Masters in Biology from CUNY Brooklyn College, and my Ph.D. in Zoology from Rutgers University.

My principal areas of research involve the behavior, ecology and conservation biology of horseshoe crabs. These animals are remarkable as “living fossils,” having a successful body plan and life-history strategy that predates dinosaurs. Part of their success is related to their ecological plasticity and ability to withstand a range of environmental conditions such as temperature, salinity, and water pollution. I have used a range of field and laboratory investigations to gain a better understanding of these phenomena. My current research addresses questions of habitat quality for horseshoe crabs, particularly in urban estuaries. I am active in the worldwide effort to conserve horseshoe crabs and their habitats in my role as Co-Chairman of the
