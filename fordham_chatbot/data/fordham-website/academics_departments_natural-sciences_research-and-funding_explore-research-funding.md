# Explore Research Funding

Undertaking a research project is a great way to develop critical thinking and develop practical scientific skills. The Natural Sciences Department offers a range of research opportunities during the school year as well as during the summer. Students, in consultation with a supervisor, contribute to the design, execution and presentation of a research project. Projects can be ‘stand-alone’ or part of a larger project. To find a research project that aligns with your personal interests, you should browse our [ Natural Sciences research page](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/departments/natural-sciences/research-and-funding/), our faculty webpages and consult our faculty in person.

If you are interested in doing research during the semester, you can either volunteer in a lab or have the opportunity to do research for credit in the form of an[ NSCI 4999](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/courses/nsci/) tutorial. If you would like to do research during the summer, there is a range of funding opportunities available. For the different types of funding, please refer to the list below. Before you apply for any type of funding or sign up for a research tutorial it is imperative you approach a potential supervisor and discuss possible projects.
