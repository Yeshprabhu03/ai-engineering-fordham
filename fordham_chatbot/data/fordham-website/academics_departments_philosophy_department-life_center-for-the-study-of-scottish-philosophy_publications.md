## The Journal of Scottish Philosophy

The [Journal of Scottish Philosophy](http://www.euppublishing.com/journal/jsp) publishes innovative scholarship on all aspects and every period of the Scottish philosophical tradition – philosophical psychology, metaphysics, philosophy of science, ethics and moral philosophy, political and social theory, aesthetics, theology and philosophy of religion – from the late scholastics of the 15th century through the 18th century Enlightenment philosophers to the Scottish Idealists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Since its foundation in 2003, the JSP has established itself as an internationally acknowledged source of new philosophical work of the highest intellectual standard.

The journal is available both in print and on-line, and there is always a free-to-access sample issue (which is updated annually) and featured article from the latest issue. Since Volume 5 (2007), some issues feature a guest editor and focus on a special theme. From Volume 13 the JSP increased to three issues a year in order to include many more book reviews, critical studies and review articles.

The current Reviews Editor is Dr. Getty Lustila (Northeastern University). Books for review and offers to review should be addressed to him, at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#badd94d6cfc9ced3d6dbfad4d5c8ced2dfdbc9cedfc8d494dfdecf). Further information about submissions, subscriptions, and individual issues can be found at the [JSP website](https://www.euppublishing.com/loi/jsp).

## Book series

Under the direction of Gordon Graham, the CSSP also developed several book series:

### Library of Scottish Philosophy

The [Library of Scottish Philosophy](http://books.imprint.co.uk/collection/?collection_id=2), now complete, is a series of specially commissioned books intended to provide teachers, students and the general reader with easy and inexpensive access to both well known and less well known writers in the Scottish philosophical tradition. Selections are organized around a particular author, or a more general theme. Published by Imprint Academic in the UK and distributed by Ingram in the USA, these paperback selections are edited and introduced by experts from Europe, Asia and America. They can be purchased [directly from the publisher](http://books.imprint.co.uk/collection/?collection_id=2), or from your bookstore of choice.

### Edinburgh Studies in Scottish Philosophy

The aim of this series, published by Edinburgh University Press, is to advance scholarly knowledge and understanding in directions and at a level that is somewhat underserved at present. The series includes innovative studies on major figures and themes as well as relatively neglected authors and periods. Volumes will cover the full range of Scottish philosophy over five centuries – from the medieval period through the Reformation and Enlightenment, to the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries – and include new studies of acclaimed philosophers such David Hume, Adam Smith and Thomas Reid, as well as other figures on whom comparatively less work has been done.

The current series editor is James A. Harris (St. Andrews).

### OUP History of Scottish Philosophy

In 2007, the Princeton Center for the Study of Scottish Philosophy initiated a comprehensive multi-volume, multi-authored history of Scottish philosophy, published by Oxford University Press. This series is now complete and comprises four volumes; further information may be found at [OUP](https://global.oup.com/academic/content/series/h/a-history-of-scottish-philosophy-hsp/?lang=en&cc=us):
