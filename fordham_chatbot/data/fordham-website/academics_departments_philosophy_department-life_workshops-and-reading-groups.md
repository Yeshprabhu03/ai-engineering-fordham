The Latin Reading Group is mostly aimed at students whose primary interest is medieval philosophy, but anybody curious to read philosophical texts from the Middle Ages largely construed is welcome—whether from the philosophy department or elsewhere. Some knowledge of Latin is required, but the atmosphere is very informal and participants with all levels of knowledge, from elementary to advanced, are welcome. We usually meet once a week for an hour or so and take turns translating texts that are somehow connected to the research interests of some of the participants and that usually are not available in English translation. The group's aim is both linguistic and philosophical: it allows the participant to get some practice of medieval Latin but also offers the opportunity to reflect on issues and perhaps lesser known arguments in medieval philosophy.

Fordham’s MAP Chapter (Minorities and Philosophy) is open to graduate students, faculty, and undergraduate students in Fordham’s Philosophy department. Fordham’s MAP Chapter advances the same aims as MAP International. These aims include:

- addressing (a) minority issues in the profession, (b) theoretical issues regarding philosophy of gender, race, sexual orientation, class, disability, native language, etc, and (c) philosophy done from minority perspectives. Meeting formats include: external or internal speakers, reading groups, film screenings, mentorship events for undergraduates or graduates, panel discussions, practical workshops (e.g., on communication techniques, navigating stereotype threat or implicit bias).

Specifically, the Fordham MAP Chapter aims at establishing an inclusive and supportive philosophical community for all students of philosophy and all graduate and faculty members of the Fordham Philosophy Department. The Fordham MAP Chapter seeks to organize events that especially cater to the needs of philosophy students and educators, and does so with the intention of helping establish professional connections between all members of the community in a way that facilitates the personal and academic success of all community members.

The Fordham MAP Chapter aims to provide opportunities in terms of space and time for having open discussions (in the form of conference talks, panels, informal gatherings, workshops, etc.) regarding practical and theoretical issues that pertain to diversity in philosophy, as a matter to be addressed within professional philosophy (and from the perspective of teachers and anyone involved in the profession) and in the broader social community. Further, the Fordham MAP Chapter seeks to help establish a bridge between undergraduate level philosophy students and those who are working at the graduate level, as a way of offering support to undergraduates who are looking to pursue philosophy at the graduate level. MAP encourages undergraduate involvement in its activities and aims to offer help to undergraduate students who have an interest in learning about and preparing for the process of applying and working through graduate school. Additionally MAP hosts a reading group each semester aimed at sustaining the broader goals of the organization. Anyone interested in joining MAP can contact the current president August Yu (
