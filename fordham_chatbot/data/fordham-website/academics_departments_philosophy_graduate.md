**Tradition and history**. For more than 150 years, Fordham’s philosophy department has trained students and teachers in the Jesuit tradition. As part of that tradition, our program is grounded in a strong understanding of the history of philosophy from the ancient world to the contemporary.

**Pluralism**. Fordham highly values philosophical pluralism. Our faculty represent diverse schools and perspectives, and students enjoy an uncommonly well-rounded philosophical education. All graduate students take courses spanning the history of philosophy, including contemporary philosophy.

**Strengths**. Fordham’s philosophy department is renowned for its strengths in:

- Continental Philosophy
- Epistemology
- Ethics
- Kant and German Idealism
- Medieval Philosophy
- Philosophy of Religion
- Social and Political Philosophy

**Writing and publication**. The Jesuit tradition emphasizes eloquentia perfecta, effective and clear writing and speaking. Fordham’s philosophy graduate students are therefore strongly encouraged to publish and present their original research. Our coursework emphasizes papers over examinations, and we conduct yearly seminars on professional writing.

**New York’s philosophy community**. As a Fordham graduate student, you are at the heart of one of the most vibrant philosophical communities in the world. Through the New York City Graduate School Consortium, our students can take classes for Fordham credit at NYU, Rutgers, Columbia, Princeton, and the CUNY Graduate Center, and attend the numerous symposia, conferences, and lectures that take place in the New York area.

**Emphasis on teaching**. At Fordham, you will gain a wealth of experience in teaching philosophy. Our doctoral students regularly begin teaching introductory philosophy courses in their second or third year, and we provide training through pedagogy seminars and faculty mentorship.

**Commitment to research**. Our faculty are active researchers and scholars who edit and contribute to a wide range of publications:
