# Ph.D. in Philosophy Financial Aid

The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Fordham University offers approximately **six financial aid awards** per year to students entering the doctoral program in philosophy. Each award is guaranteed for six years (five years for students entering with an master's) contingent upon satisfactory academic performance and progress toward the degree. Students are typically awarded graduate assistantships for the first two years assigned to a faculty member assisting with his or her teaching or research, to the Writing Center tutoring undergraduates, or in an academic administrative office supporting the department. A graduate assistant is expected to spend up to 18 hours a week on assistantship duties.

After completing their qualifying papers and the Seminar in Philosophical Education, graduate assistants become teaching fellows for the next four years. As such, they have responsibility for their own courses. Stipend rates increase when an assistantship changes to a fellowship.

Fellowships and assistantships include a tuition scholarship and a stipend. A doctoral student with a graduate assistantship or a teaching fellowship award typically receives a full tuition scholarship. The number of credits can vary from year to year.

N.B. Only applicants for the doctoral program are eligible to apply for financial aid. To find out more about the procedures and deadlines for applying for financial aid, visit the [Fordham University's financial aid page](/student-financial-services/graduate-financial-aid/).
