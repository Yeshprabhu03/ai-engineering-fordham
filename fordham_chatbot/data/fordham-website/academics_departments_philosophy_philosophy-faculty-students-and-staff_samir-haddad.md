My research focuses on 20th Century and Contemporary Continental Philosophy, particularly in the French tradition, with a focus on questions in Social and Political Philosophy and the Philosophy of Education. I am currently working on two research projects, one on Derrida’s work on education, and the other on the roles that translation and multilingualism can play in philosophical pedagogy.
