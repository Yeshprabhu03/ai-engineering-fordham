# Undergraduate Activities

## Minorities and Philosophy Group

Fordham's MAP Chapter (Minorities and Philosophy) is open to graduate students, faculty, and undergraduate students in Fordham's Philosophy Department. Fordham's MAP Chapter advances the same aims as [MAP](https://www.mapforthegap.com/about.html) international. These aims include addressing:

- minority issues in the profession;
- theoretical issues regarding philosophy of gender, race, sexual orientation, class, disability, native language, etc.; and
- philosophy done from minority perspectives.

Meeting formats include: external or internal speakers, reading groups, film screenings, mentorship events for undergraduates or graduates, panel discussions, practical workshops (for example, on communication techniques, navigating stereotype threat or implicit bias).

Specifically, the Fordham MAP Chapter aims at establishing an inclusive and supportive philosophical community for all students of philosophy and all graduate and faculty members of the Fordham Philosophy Department. The Fordham MAP Chapter seeks to organize events that especially cater to the needs of philosophy students and educators, and does so with the intention of helping establish professional connections between all members of the community in a way that facilitates the personal and academic success of all community members.

The Fordham MAP Chapter seeks to provide opportunities in terms of space and time for having open discussions (in the form of conference talks, panels, informal gatherings, workshops, etc.) regarding practical and theoretical issues that pertain to diversity in philosophy, as a matter to be addressed within professional philosophy (and from the perspective of teachers and anyone involved in the profession) and in the broader social community. Further, the Fordham MAP Chapter aims to help establish a bridge between undergraduate-level philosophy students and those who are working at the graduate level as a way of offering support to undergraduates who are looking to pursue philosophy at the graduate level. MAP encourages undergraduate involvement in its activities and aims to offer help to undergraduate students who have an interest in learning about and preparing for the process of applying and working through graduate school. Additionally, MAP hosts a reading group each semester aimed at sustaining the broader goals of the organization. Anyone interested in joining MAP can contact the current president Diyanshu Emandi ([[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)) to be added to the email list.

## Phi Sigma Tau

[Phi Sigma Tau](https://phisigmatau.org/) is the National Honor Society in Philosophy. Students are invited to join Fordham's New York Nu Chapter of Phi Sigma Tau when they have completed at least four courses in philosophy and have maintained a 3.6 GPA in those courses. Invitations to the Fordham chapter are usually sent out in early April; inductions take place near the end of the spring semester. Students receive an official certificate from the national society and an honor cord to wear at graduation. Phi Sigma Tau membership implies an active interest in philosophy and commitment to furthering it, including participation in Phi Sigma Tau activities. Each year, officers are elected from the current membership, although all members are encouraged to join in organizing and participating in events. In the past, such events have included an alumni panel (for example, on "What to Do with a Philosophy Major or Minor"), opportunities to publish in the undergraduate philosophy journal, philosophy lunch discussions, and end-of-term "Study Halls."
