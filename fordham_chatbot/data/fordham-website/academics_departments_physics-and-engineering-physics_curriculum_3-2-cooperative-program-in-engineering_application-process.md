# Application Process

## How to Apply

During their junior year at Fordham, students in the 3-2 program will apply for admission to one of our partner schools. The application is for a transfer to the other university, much like the application for admission to Fordham.

For Columbia applicants, the admission process can be found at [this link](https://undergrad.admissions.columbia.edu/apply/combined-plan). Note the application does not open until December, but students may look at the timeline of the previous year's applications to have an idea of when items are due.

For those interested in Case Western Reserve, the deadlines for the application can be found [here](https://case.edu/admission/apply/dates-deadlines) (scroll down for the 3-2 application deadlines, as they are different from those for ordinary applications), as well as other relevant information.
