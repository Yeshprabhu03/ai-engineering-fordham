# Physics and Engineering Physics Honors Program

We currently have three of our majors in the Fordham Honors Program, which only accepts 16 students per year. The Honors Program curriculum replaces the core curriculum with a program of active and often independent learning in intensive, seminar-style classes. Physics majors in the program are required to carry out research and complete a thesis based on their work. For more information, visit
