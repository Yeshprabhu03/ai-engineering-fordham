Dr. Lawrence's interests are political behavior, specifically political participation, public opinion, voting behavior, and elections. He comes at all of these from the perspective of democratic theory. His research has focused on the United States, but his interests extend to political behavior more generally. His current interests have to do with the continuing evolution of American electoral politics.
