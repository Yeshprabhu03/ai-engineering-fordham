With more than 125 programs, 52 countries, and 6 continents for you to explore, we highly encourage you to take advantage of the impressive range of study abroad opportunities offered by Fordham and its partners.

Whether you choose to spend a semester at Fordham’s London, U.K. or Pretoria, South Africa campuses or decide to travel further afield to partner programs in Amman, Geneva, Shanghai, or Sydney, you will gain new insights into how the rest of the world understands and practices politics and policymaking.

Because we consider study abroad to be a complement to a Political Science curriculum, we work closely with you to help identify the program and courses that are the best match to ensure your continued, successful progress toward completing the major/minor.

Many Political Science majors also study abroad to enhance their mastery of a foreign language.

You can apply for financial support for these initiatives through the National Security Education Program’s [Boren Scholarship Program](https://www.borenawards.org/boren_scholarship/basics.html) and the U.S. State Department’s [Critical Language Scholarship Program](http://www.clscholarship.org/).
