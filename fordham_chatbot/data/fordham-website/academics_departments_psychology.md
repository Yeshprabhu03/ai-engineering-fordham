We approach our subject matter with rigorous science, practicality, compassion, and ethical sense. In order to do justice to the complexity and diversity of human beings, we utilize a broad spectrum of approaches to theory, research and practice.

The department is responsible for the undergraduate psychology major in Fordham's three undergraduate colleges, as well as five graduate programs: M.S. in Applied Psychological Methods, M.S. in Clinical Research Methods, Ph.D. in Applied Developmental Psychology, Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology, and Ph.D. in Psychometrics and Quantitative Psychology.

Principles of equity, inclusion, and opportunity are central to [our mission as a Jesuit institution](/about/living-the-mission/diversity-and-inclusion/) and connect us to a long Catholic tradition of advocating for the dignity and worth of every person.

## Mission Statement

We, the Psychology Department at Fordham University, acknowledge that our field of Psychology, and settings of higher education more broadly, have been shaped by a long history of systemic oppression and inequality. In light of this, we are committed to an ongoing process of learning and changing in the service of ensuring that our classrooms, research labs, and other departmental spaces incorporate and empower historically marginalized voices. Our goal is to work to dismantle, rather than perpetuate, systems of injustice. We strive to create inclusive spaces that acknowledge–and celebrate–the diverse needs and backgrounds of the members in our Department and our communities. We aim to develop a community that offers everyone in the department a platform to listen and to be heard, regardless of position or identity. Moreover, we seek to support work within the field of Psychology–whether it involves learning (inside and outside the classroom), research, or service to the broader campus or New York, national, and international communities–that actively combats existing social, educational, and health inequities. This work involves a continual process of self-reflection and genuine dialogue within our own Department and with others, and we acknowledge this as an ongoing commitment.
