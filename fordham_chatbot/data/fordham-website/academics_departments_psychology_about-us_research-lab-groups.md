# Psychology Research Lab Groups

Most students who pursue study in one of our Ph.D. graduate programs belong to one of the following lab groups under the direction of a full-time faculty member:

## Applied Developmental Program

All ADP faculty are currently accepting students.

** Dr. Elissa Aminoff**Program:

[Ph.D. in Applied Developmental Psychology](/academics/departments/psychology/graduate-program/phd-in-applied-developmental-psychology/)


Vision and Memory Lab

Vision and Memory Lab

Our research aims at understanding the psychological and neural mechanisms that underlie high level visual perception and how that interacts with memory, among other cognitions like mindsets, decision making, and learning. Using a combination of behavioral, computational, and neuroscience methods we explore how humans understand the visual world, especially scenes, and how that impacts our daily perception and cognition.

** Dr. Joshua L. Brown**Program:

[Ph.D. in Applied Developmental Psychology](/academics/departments/psychology/graduate-program/phd-in-applied-developmental-psychology/)

The Brown Lab studies how schools and classrooms shape children’s social and emotional development. We examine structural, relational, and environmental factors—such as diversity, teacher well-being, and classroom climate—and design culturally sensitive programs that support teachers and promote children’s academic and social-emotional success.

** Dr. Celia B. Fisher**

Program:

[Ethics](/academics/centers-and-institutes/center-for-ethics-education/)

[Human Development and Social Justice](/academics/departments/psychology/about-us/research-lab-groups/human-development-and-social-justice/)

Program:

[Ph.D. in Applied Developmental Psychology](/academics/departments/psychology/graduate-program/phd-in-applied-developmental-psychology/)

[Critical Health + Social Ecology Lab](http://chselab.com/)

We’re psychologists, and we explore research through an interdisciplinary lens. Recently, our work has shifted to explore issues of space, place, aging and neighborhood change. In a broad sense, we care about social ecologies and the context of neighborhoods, work, health, and gender. We use surveys, epidemiological data, geospatial analytics, and community engagement to examine questions related to these themes.

[Dr. Tiffany Yip](/academics/departments/psychology/faculty-and-staff/tiffany-yip/)

Program: [Ph.D. in Applied Developmental Psychology](/academics/departments/psychology/graduate-program/phd-in-applied-developmental-psychology/)[Youth Development in Diverse Contexts](/academics/departments/psychology/about-us/research-lab-groups/youth-development-in-diverse-contexts/)
