# Culture, Migration, and Community

Culture, Migration, and Community (CMC) is a research group directed by [Dr. Andrew Rasmussen](/academics/departments/psychology/faculty-and-staff/andrew-rasmussen/) dedicated to understanding how migration experiences, cultural factors and community cohesion impact immigrants’, refugees’, and other underrepresented groups' wellbeing. We are committed to working collaboratively with community-based organizations that serve immigrants and nongovernmental organizations working with refugees.

CMC students are typically graduate students within the [Clinical Psychology Doctoral Program](/academics/departments/psychology/graduate-program/phd-in-clinical-psychology/), but have included students from [Applied Developmental Psychology](/academics/departments/psychology/graduate-program/phd-in-applied-developmental-psychology/) and undergraduate Honor’s scholars as well.

Our research portfolio includes (but is not limited to):

- identifying and measuring cultural concepts of psychological distress
- cross-cultural adaptation and testing measures of psychological distress
- pre-and post-migration adversity
- trauma and daily stressors among displaced populations
- acculturation within immigrant families
- stress and health within immigrant and refugee populations
