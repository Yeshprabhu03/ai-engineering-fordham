# Psychology-Law Research Lab

The Psychology-Law Research Lab focuses on several broad issues. The program is the lab of [Dr. Barry Rosenfeld](/academics/departments/psychology/faculty-and-staff/barry-rosenfeld/), Professor of Psychology at Fordham University. At the core of our research is the application of psychology to a range of legal issues, including violence risk assessment, cross-cultural forensic assessment, and the treatment of criminal offenders. In addition to individual supervision, lab meetings are held regularly to facilitate collaboration and support within the lab. Graduate students are encouraged to work on their own research as well as collaborate on larger lab projects completed at various institutions throughout New York City and neighboring states. Students are also encouraged to publish and present their research at national and international conferences.

The goal of our research is to provide data that informs criminal justice and public policy decision making. Areas of current focus include:

- Violence risk screening and assessment
- Cross-cultural forensic assessment
- Decision making in risk assessment
- Psychopathy and sex offenders
