The Zimmerman Clinical Neuropsychology Laboratory is based in the Department of Psychology at Fordham University. We seek to understand brain-behavior relationships using clinical neuropsychological theory and methods. The application of these tools serves to enhance our knowledge of the cognitive contributors and cognitive outcomes of a wide-range of common medical conditions that many people struggle with on a daily basis. Clinical conditions of interest include insomnia, sleep apnea, dementia, and mild traumatic brain injury. Projects are often multidisciplinary in nature and rely on key contributions from a number of collaborators in the fields of neurology, neuroradiology, chronobiology, and pulmonology.
