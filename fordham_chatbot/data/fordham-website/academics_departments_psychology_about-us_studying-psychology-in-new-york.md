Why study psychology in New York? Our city offers countless benefits, though our students and faculty frequently mention the virtues of:

Studying in a vibrant and diverse city

This cultural diversity broadens your perspective and provides for a variety of unique, firsthand learning experiences inside and outside of the classroom.

Enjoying a plethora of educational resources

We collaborate with many research, teaching, and service organizations throughout the New York metropolitan area, which offers you a variety of opportunities to advance your education and career.
