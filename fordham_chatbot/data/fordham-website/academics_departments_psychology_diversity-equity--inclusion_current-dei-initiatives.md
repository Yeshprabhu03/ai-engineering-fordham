# Current DEI Initiatives

### Peer Mentorship Working Group

The Psychology Department is committed to improving existing support for our undergraduate majors and minors, including those who come from backgrounds historically underrepresented on college campuses.

- Undergraduate psychology majors can sign up to be mentored by either a more advanced undergraduate student in Psychology, or a graduate student in one of our graduate programs.
- After a successful pilot program in Fall 2025, this program is offered every year, operated by our
*Peer Mentorship Standing Committee.*

### Departmental Syllabi Working Group

Fordham offers a set of guidelines for incorporating the principles of veritas, men and women for others, and inclusion into our research, teaching, and pedagogy. We are further advancing this work by establishing an updated rubric to evaluate Psychology department syllabi for opportunity and inclusion practices.

- In 2024-25, we worked to modify versions of established rubrics to create one for the Psychology department. We are pilot testing the rubric in spring 2025.
- In 2025-26, we plan to complete analysis of results and identify potential revisions to the rubric before operational use. Additionally, looking forward, we aim to socialize the rubric with department faculty, possible with a seminar, training videos, and/or office hours. We will also explore the potential for training AI to apply the rubric to syllabi so that faculty can have an option for self-evaluation.
