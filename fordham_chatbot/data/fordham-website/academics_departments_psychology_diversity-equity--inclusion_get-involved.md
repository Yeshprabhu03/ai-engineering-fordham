# Get Involved in DEI

Consider representing your peers as a DEI Council representative! We solicit volunteers each semester via departmental listservs.

But you don’t need to be a council representative to get involved in our work! Starting in 2025-26 we will have open meetings, so you are welcome to join the conversation on the first Wednesday of the month from 2:30-3:30PM on Zoom. Sign up for the Psychology Department’s DEI listserv by [visiting the listserv page](https://groups.google.com/a/fordham.edu/g/psychdeptdei_mailinglist_pub) or emailing psychdeptdei [at] fordham.edu to get updates and/or become involved in our DEI work. Check out our [Current DEI Initiatives page](/academics/departments/psychology/diversity-equity--inclusion/current-dei-initiatives/) to see what we’re up to right now and follow us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fcpsychdei/).
