Measurement is fundamental to good science. But progress in behavioral science theory building has not been very rapid. Nesselroade will examine selected aspects of current measurement practices, including the heavy reliance on standardized measurement in a field where important concepts often cannot be directly measured. He will sketch a possible remedy and speculate on its implications for measurement in future behavioral research.

John Nesselroade, PhD, the Hugh Scott Hamilton Professor of Psychology (emeritus) at the University of Virginia, has now contributed more than 45 years of work to his discipline, and he continues to research, teach, and innovate. He was awarded the Distinguished Career Contribution Award by the Gerontological Society of America in 2003 and the Kleemeier Award for outstanding research in the field of gerontology in 2006.
