## Intelligence, Culture, and Society


Robert J. Sternberg, Cornell University

Fordham University LC campus

Who is smarter, a Yup'ik Eskimo child failing in school who can navigate from one village to another during the winter in the frozen tundra of Alaska without any obvious landmarks, or his well-educated non-Yup'ik teacher who would die in the navigational attempt?

I will discuss how psychology has transformed a concept that is primarily invented--intelligence--into one that is treated as though it has been discovered, with largely unfortunate results. I will argue that what we, in the USA, treat as intelligence is a construct that makes some sense within the context of Western-style schools, but not the range of world cultures. Moreover, the concept better characterizes the performance of children than of adults. I will discuss research performed on five continents and its implications for our understanding of what intelligence is, what we think it is, and how they are related. I further will argue that Binet, up to a point, had the right idea about how to measure intelligence, that Wechsler did not, and that the psychometric enterprise has taught us a great deal about "g" but not so much about intelligence.
