Bayesian statistics has long been overlooked in the training of social and behavioral scientists. Bayesian statistics were considered controversial and, until recently, it was not feasible to conduct Bayesian statistical modeling because of its complexity and lack of software. Recently, there has been great interest in the application of Bayesian methods, due to the availability of powerful (and free) statistical software tools that now make it possible to estimate simple or complex models. This talk provides a conceptual introduction to Bayesian statistics with a focus on its advantages over conventional statistics, particularly with respect to characterizing uncertainty and addressing the so-called “p-value problem”.
