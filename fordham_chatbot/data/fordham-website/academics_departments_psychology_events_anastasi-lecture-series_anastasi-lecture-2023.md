**Title: Trying to Make Ourselves Useful**

**Abstract:** Part of society’s return on the investment in our science is the help that we provide in making public policy decisions. The return depends, in part, on the state of our science and our ability to translate it into useful terms. It also depends on policy makers’ interest in what we have to say. After framing the general issues, the talk will describe my experiences in two domains: climate change (beginning in the later Carter Administration) and pandemic disease (beginning with H5N1, in the mid-2000s). The talk will conclude with reflections on what these engagements have done for society and for our science.
