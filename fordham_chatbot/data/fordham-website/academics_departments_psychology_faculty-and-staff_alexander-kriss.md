My work at Fordham centers on training doctoral students in the theory and practice of psychotherapy. In my role as Director of the Fordham Community Mental Health Clinic, I serve as primary supervisor for adult psychotherapy and assessment cases and oversee various initiatives related to clinical training and providing psychological services to the Bronx community. My writing focuses on the history, theory, and treatment of borderline conditions; video game and social media use and their interactions with mental health; and contemporary psychoanalytic theory and practice.
