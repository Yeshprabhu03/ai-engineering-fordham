My Bronx Personality Lab studies the development of borderline personality disorder, anxiety, and depression. We work on a few different lines of research:

1. Momentary links between personality processes, symptoms, and self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (including suicidal behavior and non-suicidal self-injury) using experience sampling methods.

2. Distress tolerance--the ability to remain goal-oriented in the face of discomfort--as a protective factor for borderline PD and self-injurious thoughts and behaviors.

3. Short- and long-term changes in personality and psychopathology, particularly over key developmental transitions. We often investigate whether change is a function of major environmental stressors (e.g., financial strain, romantic breakup).

4. The dimensions that make up personality and clinical disorders. With the

[Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology consortium](https://renaissance.stonybrookmedicine.edu/HITOP), we examine ways to define psychopathology in terms of dimensions instead of categories, reflecting evidence that mental health vs illness is a matter of quantitative (instead of qualitative) differences. We figure out how to use these dimensions to improve inferences we can make about psychopathology's time course and relations with stress-related events/traits. -
