I am interested in the relationship between socialization and personality, in factors that shape self-determination, especially for underprivileged groups in the context of personal and cultural trauma, substance abuse, HIV infection and poverty. This includes the salience of the internalized sense of self for health-related behavior and the role of mindfulness in decreasing self-estrangement and facilitating post-traumatic integration of self-care, resilience and compassion.
