Ann Higgins-D'Alessandro's research interests are focused in two areas, the development of sense of self and morality across the lifespan and basing evaluation strategies for school change intervention programs in developmental and program theories. Current funding for research comes from two U.S. Department of Education grants and one from the Community of Caring Organization, a private educational practice institute. Current writing is supported by the Gifts of Time Foundation.

Research and writing in the development of sense of self and morality focus on understanding the role of self-evaluation and the influence of institutions and groups in their development and expression in action, particularly moral actions, altruism, and self-evaluated "wrong" actions.
