My broad research interests lie in children’s social cognition and conceptual development, with particular focus on children’s reasoning about individuals and social groups. I examine how children with diverse (and often marginalized) identities construct social categories, how children’s reasoning about social categories is reflected in their attitudes and behaviors toward members of those categories, and how we can learn about the developmental origins of early social cognition by observing these cognitive and behavioral outcomes. In my recent work, I have been investigating children’s social cognition and conceptual development in the following areas:

- Gender cognition in transgender, gender-nonconforming and cisgender children, with focus on gender essentialism, gender identity development, and gender-based prejudice
- Children’s understanding of social status hierarchies between individuals and between groups
- Cross-cultural examinations of children’s category-based inferences when reasoning about social others
