# Learning Goals

## Master of Science in Applied Psychological Methods

#### Mission and Program Overview

The Fordham University MS Program in Applied Psychological Methods (APM) is one of the Psychology Department’s two masters’ programs, and is housed within Fordham’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS). APM provides students with a strong foundation in core quantitative concepts, theories, and methods including psychometric theory, research methodology, and statistics, and in-depth qualitative research methods that are essential in evaluating organizations’ structure, processes, and outputs. In lieu of a thesis we require that students apply the psychological research and statistical methods they learn in class to real-world problems through our internship program. APM students specialize in one of two concentrations, Program Evaluation or Tests & Measures.

### Knowledge

#### Goals:

- Upon graduation, APM students will have developed general knowledge in psychological research skills, including research methods, psychological statistics, and for those who choose the Program Evaluation concentration, qualitative methods.
- Upon graduation, students will also have developed specific knowledge of either Program Evaluation or Tests & Measures.
- Upon graduation, students will have completed an internship.

#### Objectives:

- Students complete two or three courses distributed across the core content areas noted in Knowledge Goal 1.
- Students complete the courses that inform their identified concentration (Goal 2).
- Students engage in an internship in which they apply the skills learned in their core and concentration-based courses (Goal 3).

#### Assessment:

- Final course grades across all courses with a minimum level of achievement of B- or better in each course (Goal 1).
