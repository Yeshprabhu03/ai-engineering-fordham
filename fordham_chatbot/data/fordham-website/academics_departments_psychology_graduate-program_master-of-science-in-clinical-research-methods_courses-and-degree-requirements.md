# Courses and Degree Requirements for M.S. in Clinical Research Methods

**Suggested Sequence of Study**

Students will complete a total of 36 credits, including four required “core” courses (12 credits), primarily focusing on essential elements of clinical psychology research. In addition, students will take two scientific “breadth” courses (6 credits), reflecting the scientific underpinnings of psychology, and four elective courses (12 credits). The final 6 credits are comprised of the Master’s thesis research; 3 credits for a “research practicum” experience in which the student works in the lab of a faculty member or collaborator, and 3 credits for the thesis itself. Students are expected to complete the program in two years, taking four classes each semester in the first year (24 credits in total), and two courses (6 credits) in their second year (one per semester), while fulfilling the research practicum and completing the MS thesis.

**Typical Course Schedule**

**Fall – Year One**

- Research Methodology
- Psychopathology
- Elective

**Fall – Year Two**

- Research Practicum
- Elective
- Elective

**Spring – Year One**

- Introduction to Statistics
- Research Ethics
- Elective

**Spring – Year Two**

- Master’s Thesis
- Elective
- Elective

Although the “research” credits are typically taken in the second year, students are expected to begin working on research throughout their time in the program, whether with a faculty member or in an external research setting. In addition, students should plan on beginning to develop the Master’s thesis in the first year. Note that this intended curriculum is not mandatory; some students may elect to complete the program more rapidly (e.g., by taking summer courses and/or completing the thesis in the Fall of their 2nd year) and others may proceed through the program more slowly.

**Research Practicum**

As one of the primary aims of the CRM program is to provide students with rich research experience, each student is required to complete a semester-long practicum in their second year in order to collect data for their MS thesis. Therefore, although each student enrolled in the CRM program will be paired with a full-time Fordham faculty member, most students will also receive substantial mentorship from colleagues and affiliates at outside agencies, many of whom maintain collaborative relationships with Fordham faculty.

Practicum sites will be selected based on the student’s interests and goals. For example, a student interested in forensic psychology may complete his or her research practicum at the Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center, under the primary supervision of that institution’s chief psychologist (who is also an adjunct faculty member). A student interested in health psychology, on the other hand, could complete his or her research practicum at Mount Sinai Medical Center or Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.**For Additional Information**
