# About the Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology Program

The [Clinical Student Handbook](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/psychology/pdfs/Clinical-Psychology-Student-Handbook.pdf) contains important information not covered by the Psychology Graduate Student Handbook issued by the Psychology Department and the [Academic Policies and Procedures Guidebook](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/gsas/resources/handbook/) issued by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

### Clinical Psychology Major Areas of Study

Students can specialize in one of four areas through elective courses, selecting an appropriate externship, and by conducting either their master's or doctoral research in that area. The following four major areas of study are available:

### Suggested Sequence of Study

For official graduate program course and credit requirements, refer to the [Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Bulletin](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/gsas/psychology/clinical-phd/).

Students are expected to be in residence for their first four years, typically taking three to four 3-credit courses in addition to Clinical Topics Seminar and Research Colloquium per semester. Most students also take some courses over the summer, with up to two summer courses covered by their tuition scholarship. In total, students are required to complete 60 course credits. Externship (14 credits), Research Training (9 credits), and an APA-accredited internship (2 credits) brings the total to the 85 credits required for graduation. Courses taken over the summer or transferred from a prior institution may reduce the number of courses per semester or provide greater flexibility in selecting and scheduling electives.

The doctoral training program in clinical psychology is a single program that prepares students for and makes them eligible to take the New York State Licensing Examination in Psychology. The CPDP has reviewed the educational requirements for licensure in all U.S. states and territories per new Department of Education regulations. We have determined that our program does not meet licensure education requirements for three states (California, Michigan, and New Mexico). While the CPDP meets the basic educational requirements for licensure, all three states require additional pre-licensure coursework/training that are either (a) state specific (CA, MI) or (b) require completion of board specific modules (NM). Also note that licensure requires activities beyond the graduate education provided by the CPDP (i.e., supervised post-doctoral experiences) with each state mandating a different number of hours qualifying as supervised educational experiences (SPE) that varies by state. The [Consumer Information Disclosure](https://www.fordham.edu/media/review/content-assets/migrated/pdfs/jadu-single-folder-pdfs/070320_CPDP_Consumer_Information_Disclosures_State_by_State_Summary.pdf) provides relevant information including a weblink to each state’s licensure statutes/regulations.
