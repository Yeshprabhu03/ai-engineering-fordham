# Clinical Major Area of Study: Forensic

The *Forensic Psychology* major area of study at Fordham is part of an APA accredited program designed to promote education and training in legal applications of clinical psychology. This is achieved through a systematic series of coursework, research and clinical experience in a variety of forensic settings.

The forensic psychology major area of study at Fordham is consistent with the goals of [APA Division 41/the American Psychology-Law Society](http://www.apa.org/about/division/div41.aspx). These goals seek to advance the contributions of psychology to the understanding of law and legal institutions. Forensic psychologists conduct basic and applied research to inform the public and legal communities about research, provide expert consultation, and provide educational and service activities in the field of psychology and law.

Requirements of the major area of study include completion of the clinical psychology core curriculum, along with a minimum of three courses within the forensic psychology major area of study, at least two externships in a forensic setting, and predoctoral or doctoral research in a topic related to forensic psychology.

The primary goal of this program is to develop competent clinical psychologists with particular major area of study in matters of the law and legal system. Our students have the opportunity to work and train with forensic psychologists throughout NYC in a variety of settings from the forensic evaluation settings to correctional institutions and psychiatric hospitals. They participate in risk assessments and competency evaluations, as well as observe court cases and forensic consultation. Ultimately, we see our students developing careers in academia, research, and forensic clinical settings, and encourage our alumni to pursue board certification in Forensic Psychology.
