## Applying to the Doctoral Program

Students are admitted to the CPDP based on their interest in working with a particular faculty member. Students interested in working with a particular faculty member will indicate their interest in a primary mentor on their application and are strongly encouraged to expand on this interest in their admission materials. ([See FAQ page](/academics/departments/psychology/graduate-program/phd-in-clinical-psychology/cpdp-faq/) that provides additional information on the mentors and major areas of study as well as other commonly asked questions about the CPDP admission process). Students are welcome to work with other faculty members connected to a Major Area of Study or based on student interest in faculty research activities that extend beyond the research of their primary faculty mentor. We support this flexibility recognizing that student interests can change during their time in the program.

Applicants considering applying to the CPDP are encouraged to review student admission, outcomes, and other data contained here. While the number of applicants varies, the CPDP routinely receives between 600 to 700 applications annually with this number trending upward during the most recent application cycle. From these applications, faculty interview approximately 60 applicants and generally admit between 7 to 10 students each year.

In light of this large number of applicants, please understand that our faculty do not have the time to speak directly to applicants prior to the official interviews in January. Also, please check out the [CPDP FAQ page](/academics/departments/psychology/graduate-program/phd-in-clinical-psychology/cpdp-faq/) for the answers to many, if not all, of the questions that you may have.

**Please note:** Tuition costs associated with the learning of English as a second language are the responsibility of the student and will not be covered by a GSAS tuition scholarship. GSAS merit-based tuition scholarships are not applicable to the costs of additional coursework recommended by the IALC.
