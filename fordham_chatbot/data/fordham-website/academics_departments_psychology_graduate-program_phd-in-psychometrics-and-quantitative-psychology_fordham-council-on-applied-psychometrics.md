# Fordham Council on Applied Psychometrics

The Fordham Council on Applied Psychometrics (FCAP) seeks to provide a community within Fordham to foster the development of highly skilled professional psychometricians. It does so by hosting conferences, colloquia, and workshops, and visiting testing companies and potential employers.

FCAP is dedicated to continual development of the knowledge, skills, and abilities required for the steady progress of psychometric research, application of psychometric principles, and education of successive generations of psychometricians. Toward these ends, FCAP actively promotes increased communication among professionals in a variety of fields and settings related to psychometrics.

FCAP was founded in February 1996 by psychometric students at Fordham University. Until recently, the organization was known as the Applied Psychometric Society (APS). The organization was renamed so that the affiliation with Fordham University was more prominent. Members of FCAP include current students, faculty, and alumni of the psychometrics doctoral program at Fordham University.
