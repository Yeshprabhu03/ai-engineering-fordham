# Psi Chi

### Psi Chi (International Honor Society For Psychology)

Psi Chi is the [International Honor Society for Psychology](http://www.psichi.org/). Formed in September 1929 at Yale University, the society now links more than 500,000 life members at 1,100 colleges in the USA and overseas. For a one-time registration fee of $55 (no annual dues), the Society offers its life members many benefits: a quarterly magazine, student research journal, national and local conferences, web resources, and a plethora of grants and awards for students, faculty and chapters.

### Co-Curricular Fordham Psychology Activities

The Fordham psychology department cooperates with several diverse psychology student groups, which offer co-curricular activities to dovetail students’ classroom studies with valuable experiences outside of the classroom: symposia, workshops, trips, and other activities. Fordham Psi Chi arranges about 30 co-curricular activities yearly for the Fordham community—students, faculty, staff.
