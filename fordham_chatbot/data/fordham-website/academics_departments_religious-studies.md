The Religious Studies program provides students with the opportunity to examine religious texts and practices through an interdisciplinary lens. While some of our courses -- particularly those which are cross-listed with the Theology department -- examine the religious traditions themselves, Religious Studies students have a chance to look at how religious traditions have affected the arts, literature, and politics. While Religious Studies majors and minors may choose to focus on the Christian tradition, they may also decide to delve more deeply into the religious texts and traditions of Judaism, Islam and other faiths.

Students who have been part of our program have also majored or minored in fields such as dance, theater, classics, philosophy, English, modern languages, history and anthropology. Since many of our courses are cross-listed with other departments, it is possible to double major or minor in Religious Studies while majoring in another department. Our graduates have gone on to have careers in numerous exciting fields.

Because of the program's diversity and flexibility, students have the chance to work closely with our faculty and create a program that is both highly individualized and demanding. Students are required to check in with a faculty advisor regularly to make sure that they are both fulfilling the university's and the department's requirements and getting the most out of the unique opportunities which Fordham and New York City provide for young scholars. Ultimately, a Religious Studies major or minor at Fordham University will prepare you well to meet the challenges posed by the current and future complexities of our world where religion often takes center stage.
