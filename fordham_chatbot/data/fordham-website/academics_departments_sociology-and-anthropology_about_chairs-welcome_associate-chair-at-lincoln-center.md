# Associate Chair at Lincoln Center

Welcome to the website of the Fordham College Lincoln Center undergraduate program in Sociology and Anthropology!

Here at the Lincoln Center campus, we are a small but dynamic and engaged faculty who value being relevant to the world around us. Our scholarship contributes to the understanding of important contemporary social issues including the rise of the Occupy movement and reproductive justice social movements, life in postwar Beirut, the representation of Latinos and Latinas in the media, health, illness, and science studies, the putative autism epidemic, religious life, languages, and digital media, and crime and punishment.

Our classes provide opportunities to engage in research, analysis, and writing about human societies and cultures and encourage critically thinking about inequalities and the world. Since learning doesn't end at the classroom door, we also encourage investigations in the field, including collaborating with our colleagues in other departments to bring exciting speakers and events to campus and opportunities for exploring New York, from going to museums and plays ot collaborating with our neighborhood partners through internships, like the Demystifying Language Project ([https://demystifyinglanguage.fordham.edu/](https://demystifyinglanguage.fordham.edu/)).

We invite you to enroll in our courses and find us on Facebook (FCLC Sociology and Anthropology Club). Better yet, stop by our offices on Lowenstein's 9th floor and learn more about what anthropology and sociology have to offer you.

Best regards,

Dr. Ayala Fader
