# Associate Chair at Rose Hill

Welcome to the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Fordham University. We offer courses in two fields of study, and I would be happy to talk to you about what they are and what skills and career options they can provide for you. Both sociology and anthropology are social sciences that examine different aspects of human society and culture, and they will prepare you for many kinds of work.

I am the person to see for major or minor declarations, study abroad and summer session course approvals, and general questions about department courses or recommended programs based on your areas of interest.

Another dimension of your college experience is learning through research, and we encourage you to explore such opportunities within our department. With help from a faculty mentor, and often with support from your college dean, you can engage in independent research on a topic of your choosing or in coordination with ongoing research. I can help you understand what the possibilities are and how to begin planning a future project.

Our website will guide you to more information about majoring in sociology or anthropology, and I am here to answer your questions.

See you around Dealy Hall,

Anthropology

Areas of Interest: Migration, borders, urban studies, labor, race, infrastructure, social movements
