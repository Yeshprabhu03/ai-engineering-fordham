I am an ethnographer who is interested in how ideology and culture, very broadly defined, shape social institutions, identity categories, political dialogue, cultural practices, and processes of knowledge production. Before pursuing a Sociology Ph.D. at Berkeley (where I also earned a graduate certificate in Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality studies), I earned law degrees from Tel Aviv University and the Yale Law School, clerked in the Israeli Supreme Court, and worked briefly as a lawyer. The scope of my scholarship reflects this broad training. I have written about breast-feeding and the politics of motherhood in the United States, gendered and sexual regimes in Israeli Jewish Orthodoxy, women in conservative religions, feminist knowledge production, and the marriage education movement in the United States. My most recent research focused on Orthodox Jewish LGBT activism and experiences in Israel, and my book

*Queer Judaism: LGBT Activism and the Remaking of Jewish Orthodoxy in Israel*was published by NYU Press in March 2023.My new research focuses on political polarization and conceptions of religious freedom as the locus of contemporary American culture wars.

**Religious Freedom and the New Culture Wars**

This project considers what legal disputes about the role of religion in American civic life tell us about obstacles to living together in a pluralistic society. The project draws on interviews, physical and digital ethnography, analysis of legal and archival materials, and analysis of a unique religious freedom cases database to track shifting notions of religious freedom among a range of religious Americans, with emphasis on religious minorities.**Queer Judaism**

My book,*Queer Judaism: LGBT Activism and the Remaking of Jewish Orthodoxy in Israel*, tells the stories of Orthodox Jewish LGBT persons and the movement they built, revealing a rich complexity: LGBT persons who embrace their sexual identity not in spite of—but because of—their commitment to Judaism; a heteronormative and homonationalist LGBT movement; and a religious tradition polarized by the politics of gender and sexuality. The book and a series of articles engage and challenge theories about queer activism; liberal notions of tolerance and pluralism; religious identity formation; and the gender and sexual politics of belonging.**The Haredi Research Group**

I am a senior partner and founding member of The Haredi Research Group (HRG), a multi-disciplinary collaboration of more than two dozen researchers across three continents working to compile and disseminate research about Jewish Orthodoxies to the broader public through a series of reports and a dedicated[website](https://www.harediresearchgroup.org/). -
