# About the Theatre Program

Rigorous training enriched by an expansive academic curriculum, Fordham University’s Theatre Program prepares students as theater practitioners and visionaries. In a creatively fertile, experiential and artistically rigorous environment, the Theatre Program nurtures the individual, encouraging students to follow their passions and activism. As a program centered on the values of social justice and responsibility, we aim to serve our greater global community as citizen artists, using theatrical expression to create paths for empathy, understanding and dialogue.

Located on 60th and Columbus in Lincoln Center in the heart of New York City, and within walking distance of the Broadway and Off-Broadway theatre districts, the Fordham University Theatre Program is led by award-winning director and artistic leader, [May Adrales](/academics/departments/theatre/faculty/full-time-faculty/may-adrales/). Faculty members are working theatre professionals who help students find their artistic voice and develop their skills in an intimate and supportive environment. Through core curriculum, individual mentorship, a robust student-led Studio Season and Mainstage productions, Fordham provides multiple opportunities for students to thrive.
