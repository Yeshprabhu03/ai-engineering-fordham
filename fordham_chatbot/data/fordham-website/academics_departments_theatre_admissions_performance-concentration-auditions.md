## Application Fees

There is a $75 application fee for all applicants to the Fordham Theatre Program, payable through the application portal upon submission of your Theatre track selection form. Upon submitting the form, applicants will receive notification of new activity on their applicant portal with an amount due and instructions on how to remit payment.

**Fee Waivers**

The inability to pay a college application fee should **never** be a barrier to applying to Fordham Theatre. Applicants who have received a need-based Common Application fee waiver will have their audition/interview fee waived, as well. Please visit [fordham.edu/requirements](http://fordham.edu/requirements) (first-year applicants) or [fordham.edu/transfer](http://fordham.edu/transfer) (transfer applicants) to learn more.

**First-time College Students**

Fee waiver requests are available for first-time college students who demonstrate significant financial need by uploading one of the following to the application:

- An official College Board fee waiver form signed by a high school guidance counselor
- An official SAT fee waiver form signed by a high school guidance counselor
- An official NACAC fee waiver form signed by a high school guidance counselor
- A letter on school stationery from a college/guidance counselor stating that you qualify for the free lunch program
- A letter from someone other than a family member that addresses your financial situation

**Transfer Students **

Fee waiver requests are available for transfer students who demonstrate significant financial need by uploading of one of the following to the application:

- If you are independent, copies of prior year tax forms
- A letter on school stationery from your current college's Financial Aid Office stating that you have financial need of a fee waiver
- A personal letter describing your financial situation

Fee waiver requests will be evaluated after you have submitted a complete application. If you are requesting a fee waiver, please submit your application (including fee waiver documentation) but do not pay the application fee.

## Pre-screening Requirements and Guidelines

Please submit the following materials to be considered for an in-person interview and audition:

- A photo and resume
- A self-tape of a personal story
- A self-tape of one monologue (either classical or contemporary)

**Self-Tape Information**

We do not expect a professional film set up. Self-taping on a phone is fine. We ask that you tape from waist up. Please make sure that your videos are filmed in a quiet environment with little background noise; have a clear and legible picture from the waist up; and have good clear audio. If possible, film in front of a neutral background with adequate lighting.

### Your personal story should follow these guidelines:

- This is an opportunity to share an experience or story. We prefer that this story reflect your own personal experience. However, if you choose a subject outside your own particular experience, it must be an original story. Potential stories can include: a funny anecdote; overcoming a challenge; a personal memory; or your relationship to a photo or object.
- Be creative and expressive! What makes you unique?
- We are interested in getting to know you as a whole person. While stories about theatre productions are often significant to your personal growth, we would love to hear about your life outside of theatre, interests and passions.
- You can reference written notes, if that’s helpful. But remember this is a sharing. We’d like you to connect and speak authentically from a place of comfort and relaxation. We want to get to know you!
- Please keep this to no longer than 2 minutes. Due the volume of auditions, panelists will only view the first two minutes.

**Monologues should follow these guidelines:**

- Please slate your self-tape with your name, location, name of play and character at the top.
- We accept a wide range of texts, however,
**all**should be from**published**full-length plays. (No monologue books). - The adjudication panel is English-speaking; however, we will accept monologues in other languages, but ask that you provide the written English translation. The portal can accept a range of file types, including .doc and .pdf.
- Your monologue should be a maximum of 90-seconds long. Please time your monologues as you prepare for your audition.
- Monologue Advice
- Choose material that you're passionate about. The first thing we learn about you is your choice of play and character. It reveals what work draws you.
- It is acceptable to play against how you currently identify (age, gender, etc…)
- We don't recommend using a dialect. We want to get to know your natural voice.
- Embody your scenes with as much movement and physicality as possible.
- No costumes or props are needed.

## To submit materials:

You must submit an application for admission to Fordham University in order to upload your pre-screening materials. This will include a photo/resume and two self-tapes (personal story and monologue). Once you have applied, you will receive credentials to log into the Online Applicant Portal after the Office of Admission has acknowledged receipt of your admission application via email. Once you receive your credentials, please log into the Online Applicant Portal, find the section called Portfolio or Materials. This is where you will upload your pre-screening materials.

## On Audition Day

**Your callback audition will consist of TWO contrasting monologues (no longer than 90 seconds)**. One monologue must follow the same guidelines and can be identical to your pre-screening materials submission. The second should be a **CONTRASTING** monologue. (Examples of contrast are: comic/dramatic; contemporary/classic). You will not be asked to perform your personal story from your prescreen. We may work with you only on one monologue. The purpose of the work is not to build to a final result but to see how well you can listen, receive and play.

Auditions begin at 10:00AM.; auditions are scheduled every few minutes throughout the day. Please be early for your audition. We will make every attempt to stay on schedule, but please be prepared to stay later than your scheduled time should we run late. You should plan to be available for 30-45 minutes for your audition.

The day of the live audition, you will also have the opportunity to talk with our Student Ambassadors about the program while you wait for your appointment time. The Ambassadors will provide tours of the school, including the dorms, throughout the day.

Finally, you will also have the option to attend a Fordham Theatre Q&A session. The Q&A session will begin each audition day at 1:00 p.m. and will be approximately 45 minutes long. During this time, the Theatre faculty will talk with parents and prospective students about the program, our community, and life at Fordham. A representative from the Office of Undergraduate Admission will also be present to answer any questions you have regarding admission, housing, and financial aid.
