**Fee Waivers**

The inability to pay a college application fee should **never** be a barrier to applying to Fordham Theatre. Applicants who have received a need-based Common Application fee waiver will have their audition/interview fee waived, as well. Please visit [fordham.edu/requirements](http://fordham.edu/requirements) (first-year applicants) or [fordham.edu/transfer](http://fordham.edu/transfer) (transfer applicants) to learn more.

- An official College Board fee waiver form signed by a high school guidance counselor
- An official SAT fee waiver form signed by a high school guidance counselor
- An official NACAC fee waiver form signed by a high school guidance counselor
- A letter on school stationery from a college/guidance counselor stating that you qualify for the free lunch program

Once you have applied, you will receive credentials to log into the Online Applicant Portal after the Office of Admission has acknowledged receipt of your admission application via email. Once you receive your credentials, please log into the Online Applicant Portal, find the section called Portfolio or Materials. This is where you will upload your pre-screening materials.

## On Interview Day

Interviews begin at 10 a.m.; interviews are scheduled every few minutes throughout the day. Please be early for your interview. We will make every attempt to stay on schedule, but please be prepared to stay later than your scheduled time should we run late. You should plan to be available for 30-45 minutes for your interview.

The day of the interview, you will also have the opportunity to talk with our Student Ambassadors about the program while you wait for your appointment time. The Ambassadors will provide virtual tours of the school, including the dorms, throughout the day.

A representative from the Office of Undergraduate Admission will also be present to answer any questions you have regarding admission, housing, and financial aid.
