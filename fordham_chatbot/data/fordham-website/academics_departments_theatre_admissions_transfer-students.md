# Transfer Students

## General Transfer Information

All transfer students interested in the Theatre Program must apply for admission to the University, in addition to completing the audition/interview process. Here is more information on the University's [transfer admissions process](https://www.fordham.edu/undergraduate-admission/apply/how-to-apply/transfer-students/). For information on how to apply to transfer into one of the Theatre Program tracks, please see below:

Please note that Fordham University cannot guarantee on-campus housing for transfer students.

Due to the sequence of coursework, all students who transfer into the theatre program—including those who transfer in the spring—cannot begin a majority of classes until the fall semester. Please also be aware that the deadline for application to the theatre program is not necessarily the same as the general transfer application deadline.
