# Theatre Faculty

Students study acting, directing, playwriting, and design and production with a faculty of leading New York City theatre professionals. Our faculty is devoted to helping young theatre artists develop their individual skills in an intimate and personal atmosphere.

Time after time, our alumni remark that it is the dedication of the Fordham theatre faculty, and their commitment to rigorous pre-professional training, within a strong liberal arts context, that sets the program apart and gives it the reputation for being one of the top undergraduate BA training programs in the country. In addition to the award-winning full-time and adjunct professors, our students have the opportunity to work with [renowned guest artists](/academics/departments/theatre/faculty/distinguished-guest-artists/), including the [Denzel Washington Endowed Chair in Theatre](/academics/departments/theatre/faculty/denzel-washington-endowed-chairs-in-theatre/).
