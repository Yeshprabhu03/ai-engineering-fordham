Grace is a Korean-American costume designer based in New York City. She graduated from NYU Tisch School of the Arts with a Bachelor's in Drama, focused in costume design at the Production and Design studio.

Their work is inspired from a love of story-telling and bringing forward stories that may not always get a chance to be told. She has a passion for Classical Asian theatre and what it means to reach back to the roots, whether it be in theatre, folklore, or mythology. Having started from a dream of being an actor (as we all do), she follows the ideology that an actor's confidence and comfort comes first because no one can give their best if they don't feel like they can.

Other interests include costume/clothing construction, baking and food in general, and almost anything pink. [www.gaaengracejeon.com](http://www.gaaengracejeon.com)
