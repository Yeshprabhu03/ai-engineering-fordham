# Directing

The Directing track prepares students to be accomplished storytellers and collaborators through a curriculum that emphasizes multidisciplinary training and experiential learning.

In addition to taking a full-year foundational Collaboration course in which students explore collaborative processes and hone critical thinking and communication skills, directors study acting, design, theatre history, text analysis, devised theatre-making, and various approaches to directing play scripts.

Every directing course focuses on making work. Introduction to Directing is a project-based class that introduces key theatrical storytelling tools and encourages students to explore their passions, preoccupations, sources of inspiration, and aesthetic tastes– the foundation of directorial voice and vision. As a capstone project, each student conceives and stages an original 5-10 minute story that is shared with an invited audience at the end of the semester. Page to Stage enables students to develop and bring to life a production approach. This class culminates in an evening of staged scenes for an invited audience. In the upper-level Directing Production Workshop classes, students stage full productions for public performance as part of the studio season. Directing majors are guaranteed two productions, one workshop production leading to a fully-realized thesis production. Additionally, this program allows the option of a semester abroad; internships are also available and encouraged.

Directing students have many opportunities to collaborate with theatre professionals, both within and outside the classroom. Our faculty is comprised of working artists who bring a wide range of experience and a depth of vision to their coursework. Guest directors serve as mentors on all student-directed projects, meeting one-on-one with the mentee, attending rehearsal and giving feedback, seeing a performance, and participating in critique of the work. Outside of the classroom, directing students assist guest directors on mainstage and studio productions. Over the years we have had some of the country’s most exciting up-and-coming as well as established directors work with our students, often forging strong relationships that help bridge their transition from school to career. See the Visiting Artists page for a list of some of these names.

Our directing students pursue a wide variety of career paths. Many of our graduates go on to be directors, writers, or producers of theatre, film, television, and web series. Several create their own theatre and film companies. Some migrate to careers in design, education, publicity, and arts management. We train our students to be well-rounded, articulate, creative thinkers whose strong collaborative, entrepreneurial, and leadership skills open doors wide to a world of professional opportunities. Go to the Alumni page to see what some of our recent grads are doing.

**Curiosity, Critical Thinking and Continuous Learning**:Directing students deepen and expand their imagination and intellectual exploration of visual and physical storytelling through classwork and experiential learning. Through an exposure to a wide-range of globally and stylistically diverse plays, styles of teaching and pedagogies, directing students learn how to ask questions about process and the craft that contributes to lifelong learning.

**Artist Citizen and Social Justice**:Directing students develop an understanding and empathy for diverse human experiences through rigorous research and intensive character study across a variety of texts. By engaging deeply with stories that span cultures, socioeconomic backgrounds, and varied life circumstances, directors learn to create holistic, collaborative environments in rehearsal. This immersive approach enables them to build imaginative, dynamic worlds on stage—spaces that not only captivate audiences but also examine, challenge, and highlight contemporary social and political issues.

**Collaboration and Process**:Collaboration is a fundamental skill that directing students hone and develop through classes, workshops, and productions. Directors cultivate effective communication skills through ensemble work, practical exercises, and hands-on learning, mastering the art of giving constructive feedback that both challenges and inspires their collaborators. They learn to approach ideas with a sense of playful detachment, embracing radical revisions when necessary, and gain a foundational understanding of all theatrical disciplines. With an emphasis on experimentation, directors learn that the process of creating artistic work is as important as the final product.

**Risk and Artistic Freedom**:In all classwork and experiential learning, students are encouraged to take risks in form, style, and content. Students are exposed to a wide variety of theatrical pedagogies styles, and encouraged to expand their horizons, trying new approaches and ideas. Students are encouraged to make bold choices, “fail” radically in order to learn and expand.

**Technical Skills:**Through classwork, labs, rehearsals and productions, directors put into practice these foundational skills: ability to articulate visual and theatrical ideas; communicate to a wide range of stakeholders and collaborators; administrative skills such as organization, scheduling and management of resources; dramaturgical analysis; leadership and decision-making skills that value respect and care for each collaborator; professional etiquette in a rehearsal and production environment.
