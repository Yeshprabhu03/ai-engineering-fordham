# Playwriting

Unlike fiction or poetry or other forms of writing, playwriting is an inherently collaborative practice: you can’t do it alone. Whether developing a new play in a workshop with other writers or mounting a production, there are always other artists there to guide and help you explore your craft and voice.

At Fordham, playwriting students will take our Playwriting Workshop for five semesters, each tailored around a different topic and theme. In that academic environment, playwrights will learn to give and receive feedback and think critically about their own storytelling and point of view as a burgeoning artist. Students will also be required to take one semester of New Play Dramaturgy, where craft skills will be even more refined.

Playwriting students have an opportunity to participate in hands-on experiential learning through staged readings, workshops and productions. In staged readings, students actively work on a new play very much in rough draft and focus on the development of text, leading to a shared presentation of the work. Students may develop their work further through a workshop production, where playwrights see their text come alive with a fully staged non-designed production. Playwrights may also develop their work in a fully designed production. Students work with guest directors and currently enrolled and alumni Directing concentration students. Students also have the option to direct their own work, based on directing criteria met prior to.

The playwriting track typically accepts one to three new students each year, including transfer applicants.

Playwriting students begin the writing sequence in the second semester of their freshmen year. After three semesters, playwrights begin developing their full-length plays. Playwrights take five semesters of writing workshop. We address four major areas: character, story, structure, and poetic voice throughout our training. This workshop deliberately engages diverse aesthetic perspectives. It exposes writers to a range of approaches to craft while emphasizing discipline and rigor. Ours is a community of writers from various levels of experience in one dynamic space, each developing their craft and exploring their individual voice. We actively cultivate a range of voices and styles, and resist any cookie-cutter approach.

The current Interim Head of Playwriting is Tony Meneses.

**Curiosity, Critical Thinking and Continuous Learning:**Students are encouraged through classes, workshops and practical hands-on learning to develop their writer’s voice and point of view. We encourage curiosity in experimentation and expanding one’s artistry, and not strictly adhering to one style or genre of work, continually challenging writers to try new methods and approaches to their work.

**Activism and Social Justice**:All art is discourse with society, and as such, playwrights must reckon with their own power in reflecting a more inclusive and ultimately authentic world narrative and challenging inequities and the status quo and reimagining a world that better addresses societal ills and celebrates what all communities have to offer. With each class assignment and project, Fordham Theatre invites students to confidently claim their place as agents of change.

**Collaboration and Process**:Through courses, such as Collaboration I and II, Playwriting Classes and experiential learning opportunities in productions and workshops, students refine and hone their collaboration skills to work with directors, designers, stage managers, actors, dramaturgs, and production staff. Constructive communication, problem-solving, conflict resolution, and feedback are all constantly put into practice.

**Risk and Artistic Freedom**:Students are encouraged to take risks in form, style, and content. Writers are challenged through classwork to expand their horizons away from the norm and status quo, and embrace that they are the authors of pushing the form forward into the future. Playwrights are introduced to non-traditional and non-Western practices and plays to expand their own skill set in the kind of work they might create.

**Technical Skills:**Students develop administrative and leadership skills as they organize and assume producing responsibilities for staged readings and productions. They build the artistic and research skills needed to lead their own play development process, hone the rigor needed to ask questions, interpret notes and observations to revise and rework their plays.
