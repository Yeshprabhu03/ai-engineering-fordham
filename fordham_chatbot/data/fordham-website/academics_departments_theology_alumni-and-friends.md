# Alumni and Friends of Theology

The Department of Theology has been involved in educating Fordham undergraduates since the University’s founding. It has offered master’s degrees since 1955 and doctoral degrees since 1965. We take pride in the thousands of students who have pursued a Theology major, minor, master's, or doctorate at Fordham and are in awe at the range of places Theology has taken them after graduation.
