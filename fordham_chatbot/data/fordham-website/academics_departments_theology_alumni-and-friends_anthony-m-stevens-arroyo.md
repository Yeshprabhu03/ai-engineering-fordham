###### “When I enrolled for the doctorate, Fordham was the only Catholic university that coupled theology with the comparative study of religions. This openness to interdisciplinary research enabled me to introduce insights from social science and history into my understanding of the Church and its theologies. Without the benefit of my years as a student at Rose Hill, I would not have achieved the intellectual vision of religion as a creative exploration of faith in the social process.”* *
