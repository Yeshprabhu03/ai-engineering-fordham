###### "Fordham was a wonderfully collegial and intellectually challenging place to earn my PhD. I look back with fondness at the friendships and mentorships that helped me grow in so many ways. More than that, I have deep gratitude for the high expectations, academic rigor, and breadth of material that shaped who I am as a scholar. Fordham will always be home to me."
