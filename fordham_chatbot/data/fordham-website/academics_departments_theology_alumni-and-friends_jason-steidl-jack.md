###### "I smile every time I reflect on my time at Fordham. Friendships with faculty and fellow students were the foundation of my community in New York City and introduced me to a global network of theological reflection. Coursework shaped me into the scholar I am today, with a heart for justice and attention to the lived realities of Christian faith. At Fordham, I learned that theology is historical, contextual, and political, a truth that has opened countless possibilities for my work as a gay Catholic theologian and advocate for LGBTQ people. Working with mentors to create my own syllabi and teach multiple courses put me at ease in front of a classroom, and the program's focus on pedagogy put me far ahead of colleagues at other institutions. Being part of Fordham’s theology department was a great gift, and I’m so thankful for the ways it prepared me to be a public theologian."
