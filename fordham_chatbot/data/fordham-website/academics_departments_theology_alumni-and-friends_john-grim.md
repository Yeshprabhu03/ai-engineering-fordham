###### "I came to Fordham’s Graduate Theology Department to study in the remarkable History of Religions program developed by Thomas Berry, CP from 1967. I had completed double majors in History and Religious Studies with the Benedictine at St. John’s University in Minnesota, and the monks there recommended Fordham’s graduate program. From my earlier years in North Dakota I had developed an increasing interest in world cultures and their religious underpinnings. Studying with Benedictines opened Medieval Monastic and Scholastic thought for me; whereas my years of Jesuit-influenced studies at Fordham expanded my interests in global cultural interactions. There were exceptional professors at Fordham then, such as Norris Clark SJ, Ewert Cousins, John Heaney, Christopher Mooney SJ, and Byron Schaeffer who added their insights to help develop the History of Religions program. The camaraderie of the 1968 graduate class was remarkable with gatherings in the first snows to sled down the Spanish Steps in the Bronx, friendships that have lasted into the present, and study sessions in students’ apartment that often ended in moving Vatican II inspired liturgies. I met my wife, Mary Evelyn Tucker, at Fordham when she was studying Sanskrit. Under Thomas Berry’s thoughtful direction we all pursued a broad understanding of religion, as well as learning the language, cultural context, and history of a specific religious tradition. It was Berry’s guidance of my PhD dissertation on Anishinabe/Ojibway shamanism that brought me into serious thinking about religion and ecology. Moreover, along with Berry, several Jesuits at Fordham made me aware of the thought of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin SJ. These influences are all formative of the contributions I have made with Professor Tucker and others to the series of conferences and edited books on 'Religions of the World and Ecology,' as well as the award-winning film, Journey of the Universe."
