Bradford E Hinze is the Karl Rahner S. J. Professor of Theology. He received a BA in philosophy from St. Thomas University in St. Paul, MN, an MA in theology from Catholic University of America in Washington, DC, and his PhD is from the University of Chicago where he studied modern Continental philosophy, hermeneutics, critical theory, and the history of theology.

At the University of Chicago, he studied with Benard McGinn and Paul Ricœur philosophies and theologies of history, historical critical studies, and the use of rhetoric in historical narratives. These motivated his research on disputed doctrinal issues, theories of doctrinal development, and the nature of ecclesial reform in his dissertation,

*Narrating History, Developing Doctrine: Friedrich Schleiermacher and Johann Sebastian Drey*(1993) mentored by Brian Gerrish.During the beginning of his career at Marquette University, Hinze concentrated on contentious theological issues in hermeneutics, critical theory, and the role of praxis as these contributed to the function of dialogue in various synodal, conciliar, ecumenical, and interreligious practices developed after Vatican II, which oriented his research on his second book,

*Practices of Dialogue in the Roman Catholic Church: Aims and Obstacles, Lessons and Laments*(2006).His third book,

*Prophetic Obedience: Ecclesiology for a Dialogical Church*(2016), was researched and written at Fordham University, and explored the prophetic character of the church by delineatingbasic biblical and theological features of Christian discipleship and the mission of the church, especially in the Archdiocese of New York and specifically the Bronx. He devoted special attention to the role of lamentations in prophetic discourse and the summons to prophetic obedience in terms of heeding, receiving, and responding to the voice of the Spirit of God in human aspirations and laments in the local churches and community organizing.Hinze’s fourth book investigated clergy sex abuse, its emergence and evolution, in the U.S. Catholic Church in terms of

I currently have three main avenues of research: (1) the nature and evolution of synodality as a practice of dialogue in the Catholic Church, with other Christian churches, other religious traditions, and with people who are religious seekers or have no explicit religious orientation. (2) Ongoing work on the role of conflict and lamentations in personal, ecclesial, and civic life as addressed during the synod, e.g., the ordination of woman as deacons, LGBTQ people, and the victims of racial, cultural, and gender injustice; and (3) advancing the decolonial mission of the synodal church.
