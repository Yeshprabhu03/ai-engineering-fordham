Brenna Moore is the current chair of the Theology Department and is a specialist in the area of modern Christianity, with a focus on Catholic intellectual and cultural history in Europe. She is particularly interested in questions concerning women, gender and religion; mysticism and spirituality; a movement in theology known as ressourcement; and the various Catholic responses to the social and political challenges of modernity (especially secularism, the rise of fascism, religious and cultural difference, with interests in Islam and Judaism).

She is the author of

[Kindred Spirits: Friendship and Resistance at the Edges of Modern Catholicism](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/K/bo90478851.html)(University of Chicago Press, 2021), winner of the 2022 The John Gilmary Shea Prize from the American Catholic Historical Association. This project explores a remarkable network of Catholic historians, theologians, poets, and activists for whom “spiritual friendship” was both a pathway to God, and also a worldview they sensed was uniquely capable of engaging the social and political crises of the mid-century. Brenna also serves on the Board of Directors of[LSA Family Health Service](https://littlesistersfamily.org/), community-based organization founded by the Little Sisters of the Assumption in 1958, that aims to empower families and children in East Harlem. She recently finished a co-authored book with Dr. Carey Kasten detailing the remarkable stories of this community in[Mutuality in El Barrio: Stories of Little Sisters of the Assumption Family Health Service](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiw2b3BxJmPAxViMlkFHcIeILUQFnoECBcQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMutuality-El-Barrio-Stories-Assumption%2Fdp%2F1531506437&usg=AOvVaw19h1Y-LEsjDTuoTHQPHhxv&opi=89978449). Brenna is also the author[Sacred Dread: Raïssa Maritain, the Allure of Suffering, and the French Catholic Revival, 1905-1945](https://undpress.nd.edu/9780268035297/sacred-dread/)(University of Notre Dame Press, 2013) and is co-editor, with Mary Dunn, of the volume[Religious Intimacies: Intersubectivity in the Modern Christian West](https://iupress.org/9780253049865/religious-intimacies/)(Indiana University Press, 2020). In all of her work, Brenna prioritizes archival research to create new knowledge about women and other figures who are rarely included in mainstream Catholic intellectual history.She has also presented research on the resistance to Nazism in France, and has published short pieces on the religious imagination of artists like

[Sinéad O'Connor](https://theconversation.com/sinead-oconnor-was-once-seen-as-a-sacrilegious-rebel-but-her-music-and-life-were-deeply-infused-with-spiritual-seeking-210540)and[Beyoncé](https://tif.ssrc.org/2017/11/08/keep-your-money-i-got-my-own/), and on exhibits at the[MET](https://tif.ssrc.org/2018/09/21/the-soulful-comic-defiance-of-heavenly-bodies/). Brenna also occasionally contributes to contemporary conversations about religion and modernity in forums such as the Immanent Frame and Contending Modernities (some examples are[here](https://contendingmodernities.nd.edu/global-currents/httpsites-nd-educontendingmodernities20161219taking-back-global-catholic-right-reclaiming-underworld-religious-imagination/)and[here](https://contendingmodernities.nd.edu/theorizing-modernities/not-me-not-that-thinking-race-and-catholic-modernity/)).In 2022, Brenna served as President of the

[American Catholic Historical Association](https://achahistory.org/). She loves helping students think about what it means to[study the humanities](https://now.fordham.edu/colleges-and-schools/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/why-study-the-humanities-fordham-alumni-faculty-and-students-can-answer-that/), is interested in Ignatian and Jesuit pedagogy, and is the 2014 recipient of the Fordham University faculty award for mentoring undergraduate research. A Midwesterner at heart, Brenna now lives in Hastings-on-Hudson and loves gardening, serving her community, and taking adventures with her family. -
