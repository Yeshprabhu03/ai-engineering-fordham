Dr. Demacopoulos’ research and teaching interests are in the fields of Early Christian and


Medieval/Byzantine Church History. He specializes in the relationship between Orthodox and

Roman Catholics during the Middle Ages. His monographs have examined different topics,

including pastoral care, the early papacy, the Fourth Crusade, and themes of violence in

Byzantine hymnography. His current book project traces the fault-lines in the modern Orthodox

Church to unresolved disputes from the Byzantine period. -
