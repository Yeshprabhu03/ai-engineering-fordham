Prof. Schapiro studied comparative religion as an undergraduate at Columbia University before pursuing a degree in Buddhist Studies at Harvard University, where he earned a PhD in 2012. His scholarship has primarily focused on Tibetan Buddhist ideas about teachers and teaching, as well as on Tibetan forms of advice writing.
