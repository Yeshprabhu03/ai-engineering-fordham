Dr. Ki-Eun Jang specializes in Hebrew Bible and Ancient Middle Eastern Studies. With an interest in advancing socially engaged humanities in the study of the Hebrew Bible, her research engages both the social world of ancient West Asia that produced the Hebrew Bible and our intellectual legacies of modernity that shape the ways in which communities of readers conceive of the past and envision the future. Her forthcoming book,

*Contesting Labeled Identities: The Sociology of ‘Gentilics’ in Biblical and**Northwest Semitic Literature*, draws on the history of ideas of race and ethnicity, comparative philology, and the literary-historical study of the Hebrew Bible and cognate literature in seeking to answer the question of how modern assumptions about classification and identification collide with ancient assumptions and how the former informs the interpretation of the latter.Dr. Jang is currently developing a book project that focuses on historical, legal, religio-political, and literary-poetic constructions of Canaanite identities, discourses, and their legacies from the Hebrew Bible to modern reconfigurations.

Prior to joining the Theology Department at Fordham University in 2022, Dr. Jang was a visiting assistant professor of Hebrew Bible and Near Eastern Studies at Union Theological Seminary in New York (2021–2022) and a postdoctoral lecturer in the Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies at New York University (2021).

At Fordham, she has taught undergraduate and graduate courses such as Introduction to the Hebrew Bible, The Bible as Migration Literature, Otherness in the Hebrew Bible, and Hebrew Bible/Old Testament Interpretation.
