Pauline epistles, especially the Corinthian correspondence; Apostolic Fathers, especially First Clement

My publications have explored Paul’s letters and First Clement in four contexts of Greco-Roman culture: politics, the theater, friendship, and the emotions. A secondary area of research interest is the reception history of Paul’s Epistle to the Romans.
