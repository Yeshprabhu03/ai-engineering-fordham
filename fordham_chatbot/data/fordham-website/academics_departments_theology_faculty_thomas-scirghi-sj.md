In the 2010s, Fr. Scirghi's interests turned toward practical theology, i.e. an understanding of theology through both practice and theory. His book

, released in 2012, attempts to explore the sacrament of baptism for an audience of non-theologians who desire a deeper understanding of the faith they regularly practice.*Everything is Sacred*Fr. Scirghi's interest in theology was initially launched through preaching in a broad sense, that is, telling the story of the Christian tradition in a way that is accessible and inspiring for the current generation. While all areas of theology contribute to this story, for him the sacraments loom large with their symbolic presentation of this tradition. The interest in practical theology was honed during eight years at the Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley, where Fr. Scirghi served as Professor of Liturgical Theology. Much of his work centered upon preparing seminarians for ordination and lay women and men for Ecclesial Lay Ministry. For Fr. Scirghi, the study of the rites of the Church reveals the foundation of our theology.
