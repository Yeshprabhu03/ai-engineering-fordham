### Biography

Alex is a third-year doctoral student specializing in modern historical theology at Fordham University. His research focuses on U.S. Catholic and Indigenous histories, specifically the history of Catholic and Indigenous communities in the Upper Midwest and northeastern Wisconsin. Menominee, Oneida, and Ojibwe Indigenous communities; Walloon settlers in Door County; and the Norbertine or Premonstratensian Order all play roles in his research. Other areas of fascination and investigation for Alex include the stories of Catholicism and mysticism in Latin America and Spain, colonialism, and charism in religious orders and Catholic higher ed.

Having been born and raised in Wisconsin, Alex remains deeply invested in, engaged with, and enamored by quality ice cream, gelato, custard, and other frozen desserts. With his undergraduate, graduate, and professional experience in residential life and undergraduate service, he also has a passion for establishing lasting, fruitful relationships between individuals and their surrounding communities, especially those communities most on the margins. You can find him on the researcher and research platform [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0009-0006-9475-1949).
