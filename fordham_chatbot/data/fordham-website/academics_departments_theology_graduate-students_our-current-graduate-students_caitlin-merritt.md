**Biography**

Caitlin is a first-year MTS student with a concentration in modern/contemporary theology. Her interests include theologies of self/personhood and hospitality, as well as critically engaging the anthropocentric lens many forms of theology take. Caitlin’s work at Boston College focused on metaphysics. She previously held a position at the Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport in charge of academic affairs for minor seminarians at St. John Fisher Seminary. This position led to her work in higher education instruction at institutions including Sacred Heart University and Fairfield University. Through her education at Holy Cross and Boston College, and her teaching at Fairfield University, Caitlin has been able to cultivate her interest in Ignatian spirituality.

Her engagement with the narratives surrounding the relationship of the person and the natural world has led her to engage in the fields of landscape design and ethnobotany. Caitlin teaches the History of Landscape Design at New York Botanical Garden and was also one of the three founding content developers for NYBG’s Plant Studio initiative “Landscape Design History for Beginners”. Caitlin enjoys spending time outdoors, visiting gardens, and eating good food. She is an avid tennis player and ballroom dancer.

Caitlin’s projects include the following.
