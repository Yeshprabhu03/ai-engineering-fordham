**Biography**

Curtis’ primary research interest is ecclesiology, focusing on synodality. Prior to graduate studies, Curtis earned a Bachelor of Commerce and professional designation as a C.P.A. This led to a career of eighteen years in corporate finance, private equity, mergers & acquisitions, and various executive roles in the banking, aviation, and energy sectors. Following a brief sabbatical in Italy, Curtis worked at the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace at the Holy See (Vatican). After returning to Canada, Curtis began studies in philosophy, psychology, and theology at the University of Toronto. There he earned a Master of Theological Studies and a Master of Divinity through Regis College, including several courses in Eastern Christianity at the Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky Institute.

Curtis’ interest in synodality reaches back to his time in Rome, noticing Pope Francis’ commitment to resolving the problems identified in his apostolic exhortation *Evangelii Gaudium*. To this end, Curtis hopes to identify a contemporary understanding of synodality through comparative analysis and mutual recognition. Equally, Curtis is interested in the user experience of synodality, particularly as a pathway to restoring ecclesial relationships.

In addition to his research, Curtis has a passion for spirituality and mysticism. He enjoys discovering the many paths and traditions that guide us towards transcendental meaning. When not engaged with research, Curtis loves reading, adventuresome walks, Byzantine chant, and trying to perfect the perfect cappuccino. He also hopes to someday have a dog!
