### Biography

Faustino is a doctoral candidate in Systematics in the Department of Theology at Fordham University. He is a Franciscan friar of the Order of Friars Minor, a Catholic priest, and has a master's degree in practical-systematic theology. His education includes degrees in Philosophy, Theology and Secretarial Technology. His professional activity combines ministerial, pastoral, educational and administrative practices.

His research interests include Christian theology of religions, with a focus on how the Christian faith should be respectful and open to other faith traditions, avoiding any kind of prejudice or claim to superiority over them. Recently, he has opened up to exploring black theology and its implications and developments in the Brazilian context, especially in the Catholic Church. Other personal interests that intersect with his research have to do with the rescue and affirmation of black identity, especially in places and spaces of repression and coloniality, which is why themes related to processes of liberation and decoloniality appeal to him. Some of his publications include the following.
