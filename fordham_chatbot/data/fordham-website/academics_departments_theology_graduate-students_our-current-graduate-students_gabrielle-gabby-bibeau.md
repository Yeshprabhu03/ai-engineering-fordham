### Biography

Gabby's primary research interest is French Catholic women’s spirituality and religious experience in the Nineteenth Century. Gabby's other research interests are Marian piety, devotions, and religious movements; the intersection between art, spirituality, and popular culture; women’s religious life; and mystical theology. Gabby was fortunate to be in formation as a Marianist Sister for several years after graduating college, and she is currently a committed Lay Marianist. Gabby's relationship with the Marianists and experience as a Catholic sister is where much of her interest in Mary, France, and Nineteenth Century Catholicism originated, particularly in her prior work as a Research and Program Assistant at the North American Center for Marianist Studies in Dayton, OH. Gabby loves hiking, going to art museums, listening to podcasts, and a good cup of coffee.
