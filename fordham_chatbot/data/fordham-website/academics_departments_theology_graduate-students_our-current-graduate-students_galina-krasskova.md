### Biography

Galina Krasskova is a doctoral candidate in the department of Theology program at Fordham University. A professional ballet dancer before moving into academia, she specializes in late antique and early medieval Christianity. Her research explores the intersection of pain, devotion, masculinity, and the early Christian body. Her MA thesis, titled “Less is More: Eunuchism, Self-Castration, Spiritual Castration, and Mystical Marriage from Tertullian to Cassian,” offers a history of the cultural poetics of the eunuch in the early Church. It examines the response of early Church fathers to the idea of castration for spiritual purposes and the ways in which sexual renunciation was privileged within early Christian cultures.
