### Biography

Makayla is a second-year doctoral student in Judaism and Christianity in Antiquity. She holds a Bachelor of Arts in Ancient Near Eastern Studies from Brigham Young University, where she worked as an assistant on BYU’s Egypt Excavation Project. She was also awarded the Global Opportunity Scholarship in 2018, allowing her to work abroad on Dr. Jodi Magness’ (UNC-Chapel Hill) excavation in Huqoq, Israel. After her bachelor’s, she attended Yale Divinity School, earning a Master of Arts in Religion in New Testament. Here, she also attained funding from ARCHAIA (Yale) to travel through Turkey and Greece through archaeological sites and museums of antiquity researching ancient latrines.

Her research interests focus on how ancient texts and material culture inform readings of women/gender, identity markers, social structures, and interactions in antiquity. She is also broadly interested in Greco-Roman contexts of New Testament and early Christian texts, New Testament reception history, ritual studies, physical and sensory experience in antiquity, and archaeology.
