## Biography

Megan Gooley is a PhD candidate in theological and social ethics at Fordham University. She holds a B.A. in physics from the University of St. Thomas and an M.T.S. from the University of Notre Dame in moral theology. Her dissertation, entitled “Integral Human Development: Vocation and Vision of Human Flourishing in the Catholic Social Tradition and International Development Praxis” explores the underlying substantive visions of the human person and human flourishing in international development paradigms, including CST’s integral human development. This project examines the developing theology of integral human development and the praxis of CST through an exploration of the mission and work of Catholic Relief Services. Her research interests also include fundamental moral theology, economic ethics, global bioethics, and peace studies.


Megan has taught several undergraduate theology courses at Fordham, including Faith and Critical Reason, Scripture and the Struggle for Racial Justice, and Catholic Social Teaching. To enhance her pedagogy, Megan participated in Fordham’s Ignatian Pedagogy Seminar and the Wabash Center’s Teaching Religious Studies seminar. She also completed Fordham’s Preparing Future Faculty program in 2022. In addition, Megan has collaborated with Fordham’s Center for Community Engaged Learning in several of her courses.


Megan has presented several papers at the Notre Dame Catholic Social Tradition conference and the International Vincentian Business Ethics Conference.

Megan has served for two years on the Theology Graduate Student Association (TGSA) in several different positions.


Before coming to New York, Megan served as a Peace Corps volunteer in a rural village in Tanzania for two and a half years. This formative experience prompted her to pursue further studies in theology and ethics. A native Minnesotan, Megan loves to cross country ski, explore local parks, and bake cookies.
