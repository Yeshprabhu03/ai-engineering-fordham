### Biography

Shela Chan is a doctoral student in Theological and Social Ethics. Her scholastic focus

resides at the nexus between an Augustinian metaphysics of love/delight, the embodied dimensions of social relationships and the unity of self. Putting these elements in dialogue with the liberation and ecclesial belonging of queer people, she is researching the counter social construction of minoritized LGBTQ subjectivities, currents, and structures of inferiorization in modern American Protestant Christian history. With this backdrop, she builds her constructive sexual ethical project exploring evolutionary biology’s role in sexual differentiation, attachment theory, and collective trauma healing for a positive queer ethics of sacramental flourishing and generative channeling of eros. She holds these scientific developments and concepts in view to explore what holiness in Christian practice means for the current milieu.

Shela completed her undergraduate work at the University of Washington in Seattle.

After ministry work abroad in Afro-Eurasia, she returned to the States to attend

seminary in the Boston area. She currently resides in Upper Manhattan. For leisure, she enjoys running, cycling, quality coffee and long walks with friends.
