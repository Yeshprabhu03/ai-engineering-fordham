### Biography

As an undergraduate student, I studied Philosophy and Religious studies, and

completed a Minor in Classics. I then spent a year as a Public Ally of New York (an

Americorps program), teaching the college-bound curriculum at Legal Outreach, a

nonprofit organization in Queens, NY. After, I joined the NYC Teaching Fellows, a

program through which I became a licensed Special Education Teacher, taught for four years in a NYC high school, and earned my M. S. in Education at City College in

Harlem. In 2018, I became an MDiv student at Princeton Theological Seminary, and I

completed the program in 2021. Since arriving to Fordham University and joining the Theology department’s JCIA track, I have become fascinated by Philo of Alexandria and the ways he navigated multiple cultural worlds at once. Currently, my dissertation is developing into a study of Philo’s sense of Judaism and culture. Did Philo’s allegorizations constitute a conscious attempt to reduce the ethnic elements of his received traditions? How are we to understand his claims that Moses and Abraham are “living laws”? What does he think of non-Jewish

cultures? And what continuities and differences can we identify between Philo’s earlier Allegorical Commentary and his later Exposition of the Law?

When I am not buried in research, I am roughhousing with my daughters, catching up on the NBA, or enjoying some reggae with my wife.
