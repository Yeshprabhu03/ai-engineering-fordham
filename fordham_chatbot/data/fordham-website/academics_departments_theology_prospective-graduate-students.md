Fordham’s theology department is a national leader in theological education, rooted in the Jesuit vision of social justice and committed to forming teacher-scholars for the 21st century. As a graduate student in theology at Fordham, you’ll work alongside distinguished faculty who are dedicated to student mentoring, original research, and professional development. Our programs provide experiential opportunities and partnerships with institutions in the greater New York City metropolitan area.

In addition to robust undergraduate major and minor programs, the Department of Theology offers three graduate degrees, including the first-ever Master of Theological Studies (M.T.S.) degree to be offered in the State of New York:

**MTS/MACT applications paused (2025–2026):** Fordham Theology is not accepting applications for the MTS and MCT this cycle as we recalibrate our offerings. Applications will reopen for 2026–2027. PhD applications are open this year.

Whether pursuing undergraduate or graduate education, Fordham students work alongside distinguished scholar-teachers committed to student mentoring and development.

### The degrees

The [M.A.](/academics/departments/theology/prospective-graduate-students/master-of-arts-in-catholic-theology/) program provides a general, two-year, graduate-level introduction to theological study with an emphasis on biblical, historical, and systematic approaches. Degree requirements include a six-course core sequence, four electives, and a final project. Typically pursued as a terminal degree, Fordham’s M.A. in Catholic Theology may be completed on a part-time basis.

The [M.T.S.](/academics/departments/theology/prospective-graduate-students/master-of-theological-studies/) degree offers students the opportunity to engage in critical and constructive theological research. Aimed primarily at students aspiring to doctoral education at the highest level, the program provides students both comprehensive grounding in the theological disciplines and rigorous preparation for advanced studies in a concentration of the student’s choice. Students will immerse themselves in one of two areas of concentration: ancient and medieval theology/religion or modern and contemporary theology/religion. Working with a faculty mentor, students will select courses that best suit their interests and prepare them for further studies or other careers.

The [Ph.D.](/academics/departments/theology/prospective-graduate-students/phd-in-theology/) is designed for the preparation of scholars: not simply competent teachers of theology but ones who can also communicate with and contribute to the academic community more broadly. Upon entry, students in Fordham’s Ph.D. program select one of five fields of study:

- Bible
- Judaism and Christianity in Antiquity
- History of Christianity
- Systematic Theology
- Theological and Social Ethics

All doctoral students receive five years of full funding (tuition remission and living stipends) to support their work, and all students are eligible to compete for internal and external fellowships for additional support. Fordham doctoral students are active scholars, presenting at major conferences and publishing their work on a regular basis. During their third year of study (and with the supervision of a faculty mentor), they begin teaching their own undergraduate courses.

### Preparing for ministry?

As part of the [Graduate School of Arts and Sciences](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/), Fordham's graduate programs in the [Department of Theology](/academics/departments/theology/) prepare students for academia and related careers, with an emphasis on original academic research and critical engagement with the scholarly tradition. A separate school within the university, Fordham's Graduate School of Religion and Religious Education, also pursues academic theological inquiry, but with an emphasis on practical preparation for careers in ministry, counseling, and other related fields.
