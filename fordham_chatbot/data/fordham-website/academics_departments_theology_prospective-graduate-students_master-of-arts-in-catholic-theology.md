**The M.A. in Catholic Theology program is not accepting applications for 2026.**

Fordham’s M.A. in Catholic Theology (MACT) is a broad-based academic degree meant to introduce you to the study of theology and religion at the graduate level. A program that can be pursued either part-time or full-time, the MACT is designed to prepare you for further graduate work or to enhance your theological knowledge for a variety of vocations including education, campus ministry, counseling, psychology, law, medicine, and social work.

Our program provides both a foundational core curriculum, and the opportunity to concentrate in one of these fields of study:

- Bible
- Historical Theology
- Contemporary Systematic Theology or Theological Ethics

### Program Basics

- Study with others who share your passion for the study of theology and religion, guided by professors from our internationally-recognized faculty
