# Systematic Theology

Systematic theology engages Roman Catholic theology in historical and contemporary eras, while also facilitating the study of Orthodoxy, Protestantism, and other religious traditions and worldviews. In addition to classical topics (such as theologies of God and Christ), the Systematic theology program enables students to focus on ethics, ecclesiology, ecological theology, feminist theology, liberation theology, liturgical theology, Orthodox theology, philosophical theology, and Catholic social thought.

### Language Requirements

Students in Systematic Theology may substitute Spanish for French or German.

### Comprehensive Exams

In an effort to bring more precision and, indeed, comprehensiveness to the comprehensive exams in systematic theology, each student in the field of study will adhere to the following principles concerning the two major exams:

- The first topic that all students in systematic theology will propose is an overview of 20th and 21st century theology. A bibliography of “Paradigmatic Works” is available as the basis for this question.
- The second topic that each student will propose is one of the areas of the “grid” in systematic theology. At the current time, these areas are identified as follows: fundamental theology, theology of God, Christology, theological anthropology, ecclesiology, sacramental theology, and moral theology.
- A student in another field of study who chooses to take a minor exam in systematic theology will select one of the areas from the grid.
