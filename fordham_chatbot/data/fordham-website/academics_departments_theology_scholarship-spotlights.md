# Theology Scholarship Spotlights

Within the gifted and lively community of inquiry that is Fordham Theology, we are proud to include faculty with a rich diversity of academic interests and expertises. This page introduces some of the scholarship of our faculty members, and highlights the questions that they are most excited about today.

## Scholarship Spotlight -- Dr. Rufus Burnett

Professor Burnett's research interests include Liberation Theologies, Decolonial Theologies, the theory of coloniality, Sound Studies, the Blues, and African American Studies. His current research projects explore the sonic and spatial dimensions of theological reflection. Burnett is particularly interested in how the Blues, hip-hop, spirituals, gospel, and jazz reimagine, God's self-disclosure in history, and the implications that these reimagined perspectives have for life and living in ecclesial, political, and social spaces.

## Scholarship Spotlight -- Dr. Leo Guardado

Prof. Leo Guardado research is focused on providing a theological and an embodied ecclesial response to the transnational mechanisms of violence that continue to displace persons from Latin America to the US, and which persecute such persons within this country's boundaries. Informed by Liberation Theology, the lived experience of Latina/o communities, and Gandhian nonviolence, he is interested in continuing to reconcile the socially-transformative wisdom of these traditions.
