#### Current Fellow Insights

*Isaac Forson*

“My name is Isaac Forson and I am a senior at FCRH studying Urban Studies and Political Science. I am from Brooklyn, New York. In my senior thesis, I will explore the role in which political endorsements from musical artists play a role in their followers' political perspectives, with a specific focus around local and federal election cycles.”


*Kyle Zingler*

“For my senior thesis, I am examining mental illness among the unhoused in New York City through a mixed methods approach that involves qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis. For qualitative research, I’ll be interviewing social service providers, formerly unhoused individuals, clinicians and city employees in key agencies that influence policy and/or manage programs that support the unhoused. In regard to quantitative research, I’ll be running multivariate analyses utilizing the computer programming language R, to identify associations between variables such as socioeconomic status, race (among others) on housing status and mental health.”

### New York Universities, It’s Time to Tear Down That Wall

By Brian Martindale, Fordham Urban Studies

**from Gotham Gazette:**

“New York universities are walling people out. Major private institutions across the city are surrounded by gates, but not because they are in the most dangerous neighborhoods. Rather, it appears that largely white student bodies are being walled off from their surrounding communities because of unfounded fear of racial others.

Columbia University, in a neighborhood adjacent to Central Harlem, is blockaded on every side with a security force keeping watch on all who enter its narrow gates. St. John’s University, in Queens’ Hillcrest neighborhood, is peppered with turnstiles, gated parking lots, and signs marking it as “Private Property.” Fordham University’s Rose Hill campus in the Bronx is similarly locked-down, separated from the surrounding community by wrought iron and chain link fences, at places with barbed wire and stone walls. The only way in, with few exceptions, is by scanning a school ID past a staffed security booth or full-height turnstiles.

Standing in contrast is New York University, located in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village. NYU is a decidedly urban campus, built into the fabric of the city, with the public Washington Square Park serving as its primary quad.

What makes NYU different? Gut instinct might suggest NYU is in a safer neighborhood so it doesn’t need a gate. But it turns out the universities that believe they need to wall out crime are actually in safer communities.”

*City Politics, Eleventh Edition*

**9781032006352**

Routledge

July 12, 2022

**from the publisher:**

** City Politics** has received praise for the clarity of its writing, careful research, and distinctive theme – that urban politics in the United States has evolved as a dynamic interaction between governmental power, private actors, and a politics of identity.

The book’s enduring appeal lies in its persuasive explanation, careful attention to historical detail, and accessible and elegant way of teaching the complexity and breadth of urban and regional politics which unfold at the intersection of spatial, cultural, economic, and policy dynamics. This 11th edition has been thoroughly updated while retaining the popular structure of past editions.

### Four Dream Conversations in Urban History

**from globalurbanhistory.org**:

The [Covid-19 pandemic](https://en.unesco.org/covid19) has changed academic conversation, likely forever. This last June, several dozen GUHP members from across the world gathered to envision new ways to fulfill the [Project's mission](https://globalurbanhistory.org/content.aspx?page_id=22&club_id=803980&module_id=256970) as we go forward. Instead of thinking about location or formats of new events, we decided that online some form of hybrid events were actually to GUHP's advantage, since they allowed relatively simple and chap ways to bring the membership together over long distances.

What are our "Dream Conversations"? Read more at [globalurbanhistory.org](https://globalurbanhistory.org/content.aspx?page_id=22&club_id=803980&module_id=487361).

### The Promise and Peril of Artificial Intelligence

![AI graphic](https://news.fordham.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AI-1078.jpg)


**from fordham news:**

The concept of artificial intelligence has been with us since 1955, when a group of researchers first proposed a study of “the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines.” At the same time, it seems like not a day goes by without news about some development, making it feel very futuristic.

It’s also the purview of professors from a variety of fields at Fordham, such as [Damian Lyons](https://www.fordham.edu/info/25112/cis_faculty_and_administration/7487/damian_lyons), Ph.D., a professor of computer science, [R.P. Raghupathi](https://www.fordham.edu/gabelli-school-of-business/faculty/full-time-faculty/w-rp-raghupathi/) Ph.D., a professor of information, technology and operations at Gabelli School of Business, and [Lauri Goldkind](https://www.fordham.edu/info/24281/gss_full-time_faculty_profiles/11298/lauri_goldkind), Ph.D., a professor at the Graduate School of Social Service.

[STATEMENT OF SOLIDARITY AND COMMITMENT TO JUSTICE]

Fordham’s Urban Studies Program stands in solidarity with the [Black Lives Matter](https://blacklivesmatter.com/what-we-believe) movement and [all the protesters](https://usprotests.liveuamap.com/) demanding racial justice and an end to police brutality towards minorities across the country. We firmly believe that in a society, in which all are not free from oppression and injustice, no one is truly free. Therefore, we must all recognize our responsibility to work towards pointing out systemic inequality and racism throughout our country, and our institutions, as a first step toward ending and overcoming it.

“[” (Ella’s Song, Bernice Johnson Reagon)]Until the killing of black men, black mothers’ sons, becomes as important to the rest of the country as the killing of a white mother’s son, we who believe in freedom cannot rest.

We strongly believe in the importance of confronting the past (and the present) for building a better and more equitable future, and [we are committed to confronting existing racial injustice in our teaching and research](https://news.fordham.edu/university-news/a-message-from-father-mcshane-statement-on-the-death-of-george-floyd).

## Built Heritage special issue on Shanghai

![Built Heritage Shanghai cover](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/Built_Heritage_Shanghai.jpg)

A new special issue of [Built Heritage](https://www.built-heritage.net/issue-11-content), “Shanghai: Heritage at the Crossroads of Culture,” is edited by

**Fordham Professor of History**

[Rosemary Wakeman](https://www.fordham.edu/info/20762/faculty/6435/rosemary_wakeman). The journal is published by the

[College of Architecture and Urban Planning](https://caup.tongji.edu.cn/caupen/main.htm)at Tongji University in Shanghai.

**from wakeman's introduction:**

Shanghai is among the most dynamic global cities of both the 20th and 21st centuries. The city is China’s gateway to the world and its aspirations for the future. With more than 24 million people, 40 percent of whom are migrants, it is a global crossroads and one of the most multicultural cities in the world. It has more skyscrapers than New York and a public transport system that overtakes most global cities. Shanghai is a trading city, an entrepot of commodities. It exports electronic information products, automobiles, petrochemicals, fine steel, equipment, and biomedicine. It has the highest GDP of any city in China’s mainland and has become one of the leading financial sectors in East Asia, with major Western banks flocking to its new financial centre. With well over 500 multinational companies, the city attracts more foreign investment flows than most developing countries. Along with them has come a highly-skilled workforce from all over the world. Shanghai’s urban middle-class has fuelled China’s consumer revolution and a property boom. Sleek skyscrapers and glamorous malls, its brilliant skyline, dominate the global image of Shanghai and beckon tourists to its shores.

## Mapping Conference Tackles Justice Issues from a Geographic Perspective

![Mapping Injustice](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/Mapping_Injustice.jpg)


**from fordham news:**

In a three-day symposium titled “[Mapping (In)Justice](https://mappinginjustice.org/),” dozens of scholars came to Fordham’s Lincoln Center campus from Nov. 7 to Nov. 9 to examine how **digital mapping** is being used by academics as a methodology to study justice and injustice, particularly when researching underserved communities.

[Gregory Donovan](/academics/departments/communication-and-media-studies/about-us/faculty-and-staff/gregory-t-donovan/), Ph.D., assistant professor in the Department of Communication and Media Studies and co-founder of the Fordham Digital Scholarship Consortium, organized the conference with department chair Jacqueline Reich, Ph.D.

“Spatial media have politics, these are not neutral things,” said Donovan, who teaches a course of the same name as the conference for the Masters in Public Media. “We need to look at how our subjects are using digital mapping in their own lives and not just use this technology to study them from afar, like a scientist with a clipboard.”

## Congratulations NYS Sen. Zellnor Myrie, District 20

![Zellnor Myrie inauguration](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/Zellnor_Myrie_inauguration.jpg)

**from bklyner:**

Urban Studies alumnus [ Zellnor Myrie](https://www.nysenate.gov/senators/zellnor-myrie) celebrated his inauguration in East Flatbush on Monday, February 11, 2019, before a host of electeds and constituents where everyone spoke to a new senatorial district 20.

After graduating from Brooklyn Technical High School, the 32-year-old attended **Fordham University** and then Cornell Law School. He was joined on stage by his mother, Marcelina Cummings, who was a staunch supporter of the lawmaker’s senatorial bid. Cummings came to the states from Costa Rica and worked as a factory worker initially.

“We must follow the command to be courageous,” said Myrie. “The problems that are facing our communities cannot be solved with the same solutions of yesterday. They require us to be courageous in our aspirations.”


“We will be bold in our actions and we will be bold on how we attack them,” said Myrie on how he’s looking to tackle the issues plaguing the community, including housing and homelessness.”

“Think about what he’s already accomplished,” said NYC Comptroller [Scott Stringer](https://comptroller.nyc.gov/) who was also in attendance. “Early voting, early voting—the consolidation of state and local primaries — I’ll give you a fact as comptroller— that’s a savings of $50 million that can go to education and healthcare and housing. That’s what he did”.

**In Defense of Street Photography in an iPhone Age**.“Oddly, as filming in one medium (the cellphone) has become ubiquitous, people seem to fear the semi-professional more and more. A professional film shoot ascribes to standards — releases are signed, tacit agreements are made, those filmed understand the scope of the project. As someone who works alone (without a crew that creates a kind of picture a passerby might be able to understand) I often find myself at pains to explain myself.”
