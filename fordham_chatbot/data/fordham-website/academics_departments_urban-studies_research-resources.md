# Urban Studies Research Resources


Research is an important aspect of Urban Studies, particularly within the rapidly altering landscape of the 21st Century urban setting. Growing cities are examining urban renewal while still focusing on sustainability, population flux, and aesthetic longevity. We encourage you to explore a diverse amount of organizations, student groups, and periodicals that will give insight to the many challenging topics that you may encounter while exploring or conducting your research.

![Nisa Khurram Hafeez at Commencement with umbrella in the rain](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/urban-studies/Nisa-Khurram-Hafeez.jpg)

**Nisa Khurram Hafeez** is a graduate student in the Urban Studies program at Fordham University. Originally from Karachi, Pakistan, Nisa has spent a significant portion of her professional life working on policy change for gender-based violence. Her current research interests lie at the intersection of planning and policy implementation on issues of inequality and urban resource accessibility aimed toward gender, minority groups, and other marginalized populations. She interned with the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency during her second year in the Transit Performance and Analysis team where she worked to solve problems emerging within field operations in public transit. She also worked on in-house advocacy on a new harassment reporting campaign launched under the agency last year. Her final year thesis titled “Gendered City: Women’s Experiences in Urban Public Transportation” focuses on women’s experiences in New York’s subway system through aspects of safety and inclusion. Read below to learn more about Nisa’s work and plans after graduation:

**Q. How did your own life experiences impact your thesis?**

My experiences working at the Legal Aid Society in my hometown and navigating a new city like New York had a significant impact on my thesis. I spent most of my time there working with government stakeholders on policy change and continuous advocacy on provincial laws surrounding sexual violence. When I moved to New York, I began navigating the city's public transit system for the first time, and it was then that I started wondering about women's overall safety and usability in urban spaces. My initial focus was too broad, but as I became more familiar with the city, I realized that I could narrow my scope to New York's subway system, which led to my thesis topic.

**Q. How did you experience doing field research in New York City?**

Doing field research in New York City was a challenging yet exciting experience for me. To be honest, it was definitely outside of my comfort zone. I found myself navigating the subway at odd times of the night, which is something I have never done before. But despite feeling nervous, I was also exhilarated by the opportunity to conduct research independently and to shape my fieldwork based on my research questions. At first, I felt completely lost and overwhelmed by the city's size and complexity. However, as I spent more time in the field, I became well acquainted with the patterns I observed, and I started to enjoy every bit of it. The experience taught me a lot about urban research methods, but it also taught me a lot about myself and my ability to adapt to new situations.

**Q. Did you find any part of the work particularly challenging?**

I would say that one of the most challenging aspects was being a participant in my own research. It was important for me to approach my field work with a clean slate and try to avoid any inherent biases that could cloud my findings. Essentially, I had to constantly remind myself to look for new patterns and avoid getting stuck on what I had already discovered. I think this was necessary to prevent things from becoming too repetitive and mundane. It was a difficult task, but it helped me to stay focused and motivated throughout the research process.

**Q. What is next for you?**

I've enjoyed my time as a graduate student, but I'm now excited to start my professional career. My research interests and passion are focused on transportation, and I'm eager to take the next step by working with transportation agencies across the country on projects related to transit mobility and accessibility. I'm looking forward to contributing to the field and making a difference in people's lives by improving their access to transportation.

**Q. Do you have any words of wisdom for new cohorts?**

My advice to new cohorts would be to keep an open mind and take advantage of every opportunity to learn and grow. The Urban Studies program at Fordham is a multidisciplinary one that focuses on a range of subjects, such as sociology, political science, anthropology. You will encounter diverse perspectives from professors and colleagues that may challenge any preconceived ideas. Embrace the challenge and use those perspectives to build your own understanding of urban studies.
