# Visual Arts: Life After Fordham

Jobs, jobs, jobs! Today's arts and culture industries contribute more than $700 billion annually to the U.S. economy, outpacing many other sectors. What’s more, many fields outside of the creative economy now recognize the importance of visual literacy and actively seek employees with an arts education.

We believe that creative problem solving, critical thinking, and keen observation skills are keys to your success in the job market, whatever field you enter. Our location in New York City means you have direct access to hundreds of institutions, organizations, and businesses that put a premium on visual savvy.

Our visual arts graduates have found homes at many prominent - companies and organizations, including *The New York Times, Art in America, Tiffany & Co, the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, Apple, HBO, and Anthology Film Archives.*

Our alumni also study in top graduate programs, including those at Cal Arts, Cornell University, Maryland Institute College of Art, Royal College of Art, Oxford University, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and many more.
