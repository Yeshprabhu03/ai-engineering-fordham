# Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Curriculum

The Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies program offers a flexible program to reflect student interests, and each semester students can choose from 15 to 20 elective courses across the two campuses in addition to the required courses.

Students may take courses at either campus to fulfill requirements; many of our electives also fulfill Fordham’s Core Curriculum. Each required course is offered at least once a year on one of the campuses, though we strive to offer required courses on each campus every year.

Our courses reflect the breadth and interdisciplinary nature of the field and the interests of our faculty, and in a typical semester students will be able to take courses in disciplines such as English, theology, sociology and anthropology, history, and African American studies.
