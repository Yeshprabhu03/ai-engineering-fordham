# Meet Our Faculty

## Scholars and Mentors

Think of our faculty as your guides. This journey of experience, reflection, and action is a key aspect of Jesuit teaching. But these teachers are also active scholars. Through research, they pose questions; through teaching, they mold the students who continue the road of discovery.

You’ll [get to know these faculty members](/academics/faculty/faculty-by-department/) over time. For starters, there’s our 13-to-1 student-to-faculty ratio, which practically guarantees close contact in classes. But there are also ample opportunities to collaborate in other ways. And there are the connections you’ll make—our faculty have deep ties to city institutions that often help pave the way to internships.
