Louis Caruana is a Jesuit priest, Professor of Philosophy at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, and Adjunct Scholar at the Vatican Observatory.

He obtained his Ph.D. at the Department of History and Philosophy of Science, University of Cambridge, England. His pervious service includes a six-year term of office as Faculty Dean and a seven-year period of teaching and research at Heythrop College, University of London, where he was appointed Reader in 2003. He spent time as a non-stipendiary research scholar at the University of Notre Dame in 2009 and at the Australian National University in 2015.

His research deals with the interaction between philosophy of science, metaphysics, and philosophy of religion, and his publications include three monographs: *Holism and the Understanding of Science* (2000), *Science and Virtue* (2006), and *Nature: its conceptual architecture* (2015). He is also the contributing editor of two interdisciplinary volumes: *Darwin and Catholicism* (2009) and *The beginning and end of the universe* (2016, in Italian).
