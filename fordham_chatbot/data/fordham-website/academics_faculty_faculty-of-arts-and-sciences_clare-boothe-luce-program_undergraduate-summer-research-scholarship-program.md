# Clare Boothe Undergraduate Luce Summer Research Scholarship Program

## Undergraduate Summer Funding

The Clare Boothe Luce (CBL) Program was established to encourage women to pursue graduate education and careers in teaching and research in disciplines having the lowest participation of women, namely physics, math, computer science, and chemistry. It is the single largest private source of funding for women in science and engineering. In its first 25 years, the CBL program has awarded grants totaling over $150 million.

Under this program, Fordham is able to provide summer research scholarships to outstanding female undergraduates in the sciences to encourage and facilitate graduate education and further their research. Scholars are required to have a faculty mentor.

Those students applying for the [Summer Undergraduate Research Scholarship](/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/undergraduate-research-and-internships/summer-research-program/) should use the FCRH Summer Undergraduate Research Application process.

**Eligibility Requirements**

Applications are open to highly qualified full-time female U.S. citizens or permanent residents who are not intending to pursue further education in the medical sciences, and will graduate with one of the following majors:

- Biological Sciences
- Chemistry or Biochemistry
- Computer Science
- Environmental Science
- Integrative Neuroscience
- Mathematics
- Natural Science
- Physics or Engineering Physics

**Award Information**

Scholarships are 3-month summer awards that include:

- A stipend equivalent to the undergraduate research program
- up to a $1,000 professional development fund to be used by the following June for supplies, some travel, research, etc. This fund is handled by reimbursement of expenses and requires pre-approval and proof of payment; the funds cannot be used for local travel or travel outside the United States

In accepting the award, the student agrees to:

- continue in her major
- maintain a 3.0 GPA
- continue research in her field
- write a progress report by September 1st on summer's activity and progress

In addition to basic personal information, the application should include a brief explanation of your plans after you graduate from Fordham, a project description, a budget for your project, and a letter of recommendation from one Fordham faculty member.

Application submission deadline will be the same as the summer FCRH Undergraduate Research Program.
