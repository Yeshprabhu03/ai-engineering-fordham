**In April Ralph Vacca, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Communication and Media Studies, received a major grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to fund the project, "Critical Data Stories: Co-Designing Remixing Tools with Teachers to Support Critical Data Literacy with Middle School Youth." The 3-year design-based research investigation is a collaboration with NYU and the Education Development Center (EDC), and focuses on co-designing technology and curricular units with Math and ELA teachers, to examine how to support youth in creating nuanced, data-based arguments around personally relevant topics that attend to the sociopolitical systems that impact them. The project builds on prior NSF-funded work connecting data literacy to art-making with youth in public schools across the U.S. Professor Vacca shared, “we’re seeing all this scholarship on the importance of engaging youth with topics of data and artificial intelligence, and we hope to develop some publicly available digital tools and curriculum together with teachers as partners, and reimagine another data literacy learning approach with media - one that centers youth culture, creativity, and social justice.”** -
VDFAS improved support for faculty research and teaching by providing $126,577 through the Challenge Grant program in 2022-23. Primarily funded by restricted gifts, Challenge Grants are a vital resource to support faculty research and teaching. Activities funded by Challenge Grants included, for example, workshops to disseminate research to revise the traditional understanding of the Renaissance, a conference on traffic in the global eighteenth century, a conference on cultural exchanges between Italy and the world, and a composers’ workshop.

In November 2021,

**Stephen Grimm, Ph.D., Professor of Philosophy,**received a three-year, $300,000 grant to launch the program, “Visions of the Good in the Bronx,” that aims to work with students from the borough, particularly those who are underserved or might not have access to the same resources as their peers. Students in the seminar tackle questions about what it means to live a good and fulfilling human life, and the program kicked off last summer with sixteen Bronx high school students who lived in the dorms of the Rose Hill campus (see photo below). With much excitement and enthusiasm, the program will be continuing this summer under the leadership of**Lauren Kopajtic, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Philosophy, and Nicholas Smyth, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Philosophy**. The three-week seminar will run from July 5-25 on the Rose Hill campus, and the summer program will be followed by a year-long mentoring program where students reinforce essential life and college-readiness skills, and successful students will receive letters of recommendation from their summer professors to accompany their college applications. Professor Grimm notes that "It was a pure pleasure to be part of the seminar last year. The discussions were great, everyone worked hard and had fun, and we all learned a lot from one another."![](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/Teaching-Scholar.jpg)
