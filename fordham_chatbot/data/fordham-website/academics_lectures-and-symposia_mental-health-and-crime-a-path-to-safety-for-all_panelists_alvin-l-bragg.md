**Alvin L. Bragg Jr**. is the 37th district attorney elected in Manhattan. A son of Harlem who has served as both a state and federal prosecutor, Bragg has spent more than two decades fighting to make New York’s communities safer and criminal justice system fairer.

As district attorney, Bragg restructured the Manhattan DA’s office to focus more resources on prosecuting serious violent crimes. Under his leadership, a new division, Pathways to Public Safety, was created to address recidivism and enhance public safety by elevating the office’s use of programming and diversion, including mental health treatment. Specially trained Pathways Assistant DAs are embedded in each of the office’s trial bureaus to screen and assess every case as early as possible.

Prior to becoming the district attorney, Bragg served as an assistant attorney general at the New York State Attorney General’s Office and as an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. In these roles, Bragg handled a wide array of criminal cases, including armed robbery, witness tampering, narcotics and gun trafficking, wage and hour violations, public corruption, and money laundering. He ended his service in the New York AG’s office as the chief deputy attorney general, overseeing the office’s criminal and civil investigations and litigation.

Bragg earned his A.B. from Harvard University, a J.D. from Harvard Law School, and clerked for Hon. Robert P. Patterson Jr. in the Southern District of New York. Bragg is a former member of the boards of directors of the New York Urban League and the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. He is a Sunday School teacher at his church.
