[The New York Botanical Garden](https://www.nybg.org/) and Fordham's Biology Department and Louis Calder Center jointly train PhD students in Biology. Students benefit from the strengths of both institutions and work on research projects that combine plant systematics, conservation biology, and ecology.

Graduate students in this joint program have full access to the staff expertise and resources of both institutions, including NYBG’s Pfizer plant research laboratory, Steere Herbarium, and Mertz Library, and Fordham’s Calder Center and the Biology Department’s broad range of courses in biology.
