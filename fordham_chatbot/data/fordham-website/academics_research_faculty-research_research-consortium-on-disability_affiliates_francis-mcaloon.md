Professor

**Bio:**

[Francis X. McAloon](/graduate-school-of-education/faculty/francis-x-mcaloon/), S.J., (STL; PhD) is Associate Professor of Christian Spirituality and Ignatian Studies at Fordham's Graduate School of Religion. Currently, he serves as director of the Doctor of Ministry (DMin) program and coordinator of the Christian Spirituality academic and pastoral programs (MA and advanced certificates). He serves on the board of directors for the Society for the Study of Christian Spirituality and currently serves as a liaison between the SSCS board and the editorial board for *Spiritus: a Journal of Christian Spirituality*. His current research builds upon earlier books and articles focusing upon the poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins and their potential as texts for prayer, employing the interdisciplinary tools of the academic study of Christian spirituality, Paul Ricoeurs hermeneutics, and new-historicist literary criticism. Recently, he has added a concentration in the methods and critiques of disability studies, focusing upon (1) the cultural, medical, theological, and spiritual constructs concerning chronic illness, (2) how to critique and reimagine said constructs, and (3) proposing possibilities for spiritual affiliation -- through prayer, poetry, and the arts.
