**Bio:**

Gage Krause is a Ph.D. candidate in Philosophy specializing in phenomenology, philosophy of disability, and philosophy of psychiatry. His dissertation research integrates phenomenological psychopathology with critical disability studies to examine how ableist norms and practices affect the lived experience of psychiatric disabilities. He aims to develop a sounder philosophical account of psychiatric disability that addresses how these conditions can become part of one’s social identity and, thus, are shaped by history and power.
