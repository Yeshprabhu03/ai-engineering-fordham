Professor

**Bio:**

Sophie Mitra is professor of economics, founding director of the Research Consortium on Disability at Fordham University in New York City and principal investigator of the [Disability Data Initiative](https://disabilitydata.ace.fordham.edu/). Her research agenda has documented economic insecurity and identified policies that reduce it. A line of work consists in evaluating the impact of social protection policies on wellbeing and health with a particular focus currently on long-term care insurance. Another line of work has produced evidence to document disability inequalities and to understand the factors that drive them, such as discrimination or extra costs of living for families (e.g. medical or transportation costs). She is the author of [Disability, Health and Human Development](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781137536372) (Palgrave MacMillan, 2018), in which she proposed the human development model disability, health and wellbeing based on the capability approach. She received her doctorate in economics from Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne.
