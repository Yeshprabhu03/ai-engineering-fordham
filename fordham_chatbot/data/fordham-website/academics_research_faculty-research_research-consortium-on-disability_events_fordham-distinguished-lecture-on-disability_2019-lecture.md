# 2019 Fordham Distinguished Lecture on Disability

**Speaker: Eli Clare “Notes on Cure, Disability and Natural Worlds”**

Wednesday, April 10, 2019

*Description:* Through storytelling and critical analysis, Eli Clare explores the meanings of cure, the connections between disability and environmental injustice, and the violence done by the ideas of abnormal and unnatural.

*Bio:* White, disabled, and genderqueer, Eli Clare lives near Lake Champlain in occupied Abenaki territory (currently known as Vermont) where he writes and proudly claims a penchant for rabble-rousing. He has written two books of creative non-fiction, *Brilliant Imperfection: Grappling with Cure* and *Exile and Pride: Disability, Queerness, and Liberation*, and a collection of poetry, *The Marrow's Telling: Words in Motion*, and has been published in many periodicals and anthologies. Eli speaks, teaches, and facilitates all over the United States and Canada at conferences, community events, and colleges about disability, queer and trans identities, and social justice. Among other pursuits, he has walked across the United States for peace, coordinated a rape prevention program, and helped organize the first ever Queerness and Disability Conference.

The speaker was introduced by Prof. Crystal and the lecture was moderated by Prof. Tyler.
