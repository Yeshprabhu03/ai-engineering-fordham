# Research Conducted by Researchers Not Affiliated with Fordham University

The Fordham University Institutional Review Board (IRB) reviews all human subject research conducted by faculty, staff, and students, regardless of the location of the research activity, source of funding, and whether the research is exempt under the Code of Federal Regulations for Protection of Human Subjects (45 CFR 46). The IRB is also required to review research that is conducted by researchers who are not affiliated with the University when their research proposes to make use of University facilities or recruit University students, staff or faculty as research participants.

The following procedure applies to researchers not affiliated with Fordham University:

- Researchers should first receive IRB approval from their own institution. The researcher should then provide the Fordham IRB with a copy of the IRB application materials (protocol, recruitment, data collection) and approval letter.
- It will then be determined if Fordham University is engaged in the research.
- If it is determined that Fordham University is engaged, the research study will go through a formal review by the Fordham IRB. If it is determined that Fordham is not engaged in the research, the research study will only require an administrative review by the Research Compliance Director.
