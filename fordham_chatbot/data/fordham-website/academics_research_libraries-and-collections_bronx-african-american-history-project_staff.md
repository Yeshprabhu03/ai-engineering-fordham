Lucy Blanco’s career as a jazz vocalist happened almost by chance. Now, years later, she is co-founder and lead singer of the Afri-Garifuna Jazz Ensemble in New York City, simultaneously recording her own debut album with international pianist Warren Byrd. Lucy grew up in the Bronx, daughter to two Garifuna immigrants. She moved to Los Angeles for college and to start her career. After getting married and having a baby, she stepped away from her career, but this gave her time to explore her singing abilities. She joined performance groups and honed her talents. After an Artist in Residence program in Amsterdam, she was Inspired by the way music transcends culture and language and she longed to explore the musical heritage of the Garifuna people. Lucy sought ways to combine traditional Garifuna rhythms with jazz. This culminated in her first recorded piece.

Shortly after moving back to New York City, she met Garifuna musician- composer James Lovell, with whom she founded the Afri-Garifuna Jazz Ensemble. The Afri-Garifuna Jazz Ensemble is the first project of its kind; an innovative genre-bending project that blends Garifuna language, instruments and traditional rhythms such as Punta, Paranda and Hungu Hungu, with jazz arrangements. In their words, it is “jazz interpreted from a Garifuna perspective.” As one of the few female Garifuna artists and only Garifuna jazz vocalist, Lucy is grateful for the opportunities to continue this work.
