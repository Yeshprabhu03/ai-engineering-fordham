# Support the BIAHI

With your tax deductible gift, we will be able to reach even more members of the community, train student workers, purchase equipment for running interviews and create and maintain an online, open-access digital archive.

## Funding Uses

We have a small annual operating budget that allows us to host interviews, pay student workers, make smaller equipment purchases as needed, pursue community collaborations, involve Fordham students in Bronx community heritage and outreach. The goals of our project dictate that we straddle the demands of a community with those of academic research, so a small portion of our budget also supports our academic work, which includes travel to conferences in the U.S. and Italy mostly and facilitates our ability to bring our project visibility in North America and in Italy.

## Our Supporters

Thank you to each and every donor who has made and who continues to make our project possible!

Our camera and microphone were purchased with a generous gift from the [Calandra Italian American Institute](https://calandrainstitute.org/).

In 2017 we ran a successful crowdfunding campaign and we raised over $6,000. [View the complete result of the crowdfunding campaign](http://www.givecampus.com/schools/FordhamUniversity/bronx-italian-american-history).

In 2018 we received an Interdisciplinary grant from Fordham's Office of Research.
