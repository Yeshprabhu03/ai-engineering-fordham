*Studies in Ancient and Medieval History, Thought, and Religion*

Founded at Fordham University in 1943, *Traditio* is an international journal published annually in the fall by Cambridge University Press and dedicated to the study of late ancient and medieval history, thought, and religion.

*Traditio* publishes monographic essays, critical editions of Latin texts, and research tools such as catalogues of unpublished manuscripts. Submissions in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish are accepted. Articles have treated history, literature, patristics, philosophy, theology, and art history. The periods covered are early Christianity, late antiquity, and the Middle Ages, up to 1500 CE.

*Traditio* publishes 8-12 articles per volume with an acceptance rate of 40%. There is no word limit for submissions, but the editorial board applies extra scrutiny to submissions over 12,000 words in length. Shorter submissions (fewer than 6,000 words) are welcome, but they will appear at the end of the volume under the heading “Miscellany”.
