# Traditio Style Sheet

## Notes for Contributors

Manuscripts submitted to TRADITIO should be error-free and stylistically consistent. Authors are responsible for the accuracy of the text, including dates and citations, which should be verified before the final manuscript is submitted.

During June and July, the staff at TRADITIO copyedit the articles. One or more copyedited versions are sent to authors, until final approval is received. At this stage changes can be made easily; hence, careful attention should be paid to the correction of this version. In the fall, contributors will receive PDFs of their typeset articles; at that stage, only typos may be corrected. Upon publication, authors will receive PDFs of their articles and one copy of the volume.

Authors should follow, first, these Notes for Contributors and then the Chicago Manual of Style, 18th edition (2024). Because of the demands of technical subjects, some slight variations may be expected.


**PRESENTATION OF THE MANUSCRIPT**

*Text and Program. * All contributions should be submitted in Microsoft Word.

*Formatting.* Authors should avoid using display type such as boldface or larger fonts, except for italics to indicate words to be italicized in the printed version. Underlining should not be used for emphasis. Use 12-point font both for text and for endnotes. Automatic hyphenation should be turned off and only the left margin justified.

*Subheadings.* Subheadings and sub-subheadings within an article may (and often should) be employed. TRADITIO prints subheadings in caps and small caps, centered, and sub-subheadings in italics, flush left. Subheadings are not numbered. Subheadings are not allowed at the beginning of an article.

*English Spelling and Style.* For articles in English, TRADITIO uses U.S. spelling and conventions of punctuation. The dictionary used for reference at TRADITIO is the *American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language*, 5th edition. Manuscripts submitted with British spelling and punctuation will be changed accordingly. TRADITIO uses a comma before the conjunction in a series: Tom, Dick, and Harry; not Tom, Dick and Harry. TRADITIO prints m-dashes — which should be used sparingly — with a space before and after. An m-dash may be indicated by two consecutive hyphens.

*Notes.* Notes should be formatted as endnotes and numbered consecutively. Note numbers in the text should follow punctuation marks and be superscripted, without parentheses.

**ABSTRACT, KEYWORDS, EMAIL ADDRESS**

The author should include an abstract of the article, 200 to 250 words long, placed after the title and the author’s name and before the text of the article. At the end of the article, the author’s academic affiliation or the phrase “Independent Scholar” will be printed, along with the author’s email address and a list of five to seven keywords (which the author should supply). TRADITIO does not print bibliographies at the end of articles.

**TEXT**

*Possessives.* Following the Chicago Manual, TRADITIO uses an "s" after sibilants: Burns’s poems, Marx’s theories, Dickens’s novels, Jesus’s name, Socrates’s death.

*Quotations.* Quotations in a language written in Latin letters should be enclosed within double quotation marks and not italicized. If texts are cited in the article in translation, the original should be provided in a note.

*The Bible.* Books of the Bible are referred to by arabic numerals; chapter and verse are separated by a colon. Names of books, or books of which only a chapter number is given, are spelled out: Ephesians; Matthew 28; Acts 3–5. If chapter and verse are given, the name of the book is spelled out in the text (Genesis 3:15) but abbreviated, with a period, in parenthetical citations and in notes: Gen. 3:15; 1 Cor. 3:23–24. Use the abbreviations found in the Chicago Manual 10.44–48 and reproduced here in the Appendix.

*Foreign Words and Phrases.* Words and short phrases in languages other than English should be italicized, except for familiar foreign words and phrases (found without italics in standard dictionaries) like fait accompli, mea culpa, or Weltanschauung. Avoid the use of academic terms and abbreviations like ca., cf., e.g., et al., etc., idem and eadem, i.e., and provide their modern language equivalent instead (around, compare, for example, and so on). The exception to this rule is the use of *passim*, which is allowed. Use anglicized versions of foreign place names: Munich, Vienna, Prague, not München, Wien, Praha.

*Capitalization.* In general, capitalize less rather than more. For example: bishop of Paris, king of France, master of arts; the church (as an institution); heaven, hell; the East, the West (as cultural, political entities); Roman Empire, the empire, the eastern empire; the Fall, the Flood, the Annunciation, the Assumption; God, Christ (but lowercase personal pronouns with these antecedents); Bible, but biblical; scripture, scriptural; Mass (the eucharistic sacrament), but mass (individual celebrations). Lowercase references to constituent parts of a book (introduction, appendix).

*Numbers.* Spell out whole numbers from one through ninety-nine and any numbers that begin a sentence. Use a comma after the thousands place for a precise number but not for a rounded one: 3,429; 3400. Note also: 20 percent; 1200s; 26 January 987, not January 26; 325 BCE and325 CE. Chapters should be designated by arabic numerals.

*Inclusive Numbers. * In references to consecutive pages, paragraphs, and the like use the form 18–27 (with an n-dash), never 18ff. or 18sqq. If 18–19 is meant, use that form and not 18f.

*Abbreviating Inclusive Numbers. * See Chicago Manual 9.61, but with some exceptions. If the first number is less than 100, use all digits: 1–10, 71–75, 96–115. For 100 or multiples of 100, use all digits: 100–104, 600–618. From 101 through 109 and multiples, use all digits 106–107, 503–17, 1002–1007. From 110 through 199 and multiples, use two digits, or more if needed: 321–25, 415–532, 1536–38. Inclusive dates follow the same system. Examples: the war of 1914–18; 300–325 CE; the fiscal year 1975–76 or 1975/76 (otherwise, avoid the solidus [slash, virgule]). But the dates of the birth and death of a person should be written out in full: Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865).

**NOTES**

Do not use more than one note per sentence and always place the note at the end of the sentence after the punctuation. Do not place a note on a Subheading or Subheading. Discursive footnotes are allowed and encouraged, but only so long as they are clear for the reader to follow.

*Acknowledgments and Expressions of Gratitude.* Acknowledgments and expressions of gratitude are printed in one unnumbered note before the first footnote. Authors are asked to exercise restraint in naming and thanking their benefactors.

*Reference Notes.* Bibliographical references belong in the notes, not in the text. When a bibliographical item is cited for the first time, the reference should contain the complete data. The author’s name should be written as it appears in the original, either with first name or initials. If the title page of the book cited lists two or more cities with the publisher’s name, the city listed first should be used. If a place of publication in the U.S. is not well known, the abbreviation of the state name should follow it. Use the two-letter codes prescribed by the United States Postal Service (NY, MA, DE, now preferred by the Chicago Manual [10.27]). Cambridge in Massachusetts always includes MA. Shortened, second references consist of the author’s last name, the shortened title of the book, and the page number.. Ibid., op. cit., and loc. cit. should not be used. TRADITIO departs from Chicago style in omitting the publisher’s name. Otherwise, Chicago Manual, chapter 14, “Notes and Bibliography” should be followed. The following are examples of acceptable citations and abridgments.

6 Henri Peltier, *Pascase Radbert* (Amiens, 1938), 54.

10 Peltier, *Pascase Radbert*, 57–58.


*Books in Series and Multivolume Works.* Books in series are a sequence of publications related in subject matter and developed under the supervision of an editor or a group of editors. A series is open, and new volumes may be added. Multivolume works are closed, by their subject matter or their purpose. They may contain, for example, all of some illustrious person’s letters, or a history of some country by several authors, or one author’s history of a period under several different titles. The citation should provide only information that is useful to the reader and not be filled with learned clutter.

*Books in Series.* If the author wishes to include the title of a series (which is not always necessary), the series title is capitalized like a book title, put in roman type, and not enclosed in quotation marks or parentheses. The number of the volume in the series should be given (without a comma) in arabic numerals, even if the original has a roman number. Examples:

1 C. Bremond, J. Le Goff, and J. C. Schmitt, *L’Exemplum*, Typologie des sources du Moyen Âge occidental 40 (Turnhout, 1982).

2 Hans von Campenhausen, *Die Entstehung der christlichen Bibel*, Beiträge zur historischen Theologie 39 (Tübingen, 1968).

3 C. M. Kauffmann, *Romanesque Manuscripts, 1066–1190*, Survey of Manuscripts Illuminated in the British Isles 3 (London, 1975).


*Multivolume Works. * The treatment of multivolume works in notes can be complicated; authors are asked to strive for clarity and simplicity and to give only information that is helpful. The number of the volume in the series should be given in arabic, even if the original has a roman number. Examples:

1 *The Lisle Letters*, ed. Muriel St. Clare Byrne, 6 vols. (Chicago, 1981), 5:246.

2 Jaroslav Pelikan, *The Christian Tradition: A History of the Development of Doctrine*, The Growth of Medieval Theology (600–1300), 5 vols. (Chicago, 1971–1979), 3:76.

Second reference: 3 Pelikan, *The Christian Tradition*, 3:77–79.


*Articles.* Articles are cited by author’s name followed by a comma, title followed by a comma, title of journal in italics, volume number (without the number of a part within a volume, such as 4, 1, or month or season of publication), year of publication in parentheses, colon, and inclusive pages. Examples:

1 A. E. R. Boak, “Some Early Byzantine Tax Records from Egypt,” *Harvard Studies in Classical Philology* 51 (1940): 56–110, at 100–103.

2 James F. Powers, “Frontier Municipal Baths and Social Interaction in Thirteenth-Century Spain,” *American Historical Review* 84 (1979): 655–57.

Second reference: 3 Powers, “Frontier Municipal Baths”, 656.


*Standard Abbreviations for TRADITIO.* TRADITIO has a list of abbreviations that are to be used without further explanation; see appendix to these Notes. Abbreviations are not italicized.

*List of Abbreviations Supplied by Author.* If several works are referred to frequently, or if the author intends to use an abbreviation throughout, this detail should be noted and the works cited in alphabetical order by author or abbreviation before the first footnote but after the author’s acknowledgments. Examples:

The following abbreviations will be employed: AHDL = *Archives d’histoire doctrinale et littéraire du Moyen Âge*; and HTCP = *A History of Twelfth-Century Philosophy*, ed. P. Dronke (Cambridge, MA, 1988).

Citations from the works of Chaucer are from *The Riverside Chaucer*, ed. L. D. Benson (Boston, 1987) and will be identified hereafter by an abbreviated title and line number.

*Abbreviations for Parts of Books.* Use the following abbreviations: n., nn. [note(s)]; line, lines [no abbreviation]; col., cols. [column(s)]; bk., bks. [book(s)]; n.s. [new series]; esp. [especially]; vol., vols. [volume(s)]; MS, MSS [manuscript(s) — no period]; no. [number]. Avoid the following abbreviations unless they are required for clarity: vol. [volume], p., pp. [page(s)], v. [verse]. The abbreviations l. and ll. for line(s) or liber (libri) should not be used, as they are easily misread as numerals.

*Classical and Patristic Works.* For standard abbreviations of classical authors’ names and works, see the comprehensive listing in the *Oxford Classical Dictionary*. For Greek patristic works, see the abbreviations in G. W. H. Lampe, *Patristic Greek Lexicon*. For writings of ancient and medieval authors, the title of the work is followed by the indication of the book and chapter, or whatever subdivisions there may be. Arabic numerals designating these subdivisions should be separated by periods (without insertion of space); the comma (or, if appropriate, the semicolon) followed by a space separates two consecutive references (for example, Cicero, *De officiis* 2.7.24; *De oratore* 1.44.196, 46.201; 2.30.132; Pliny, *Ep.* 2.4, 7, 14). The edition used should be specified in the first citation; if several editions of the same work are cited, the editor’s surname should be given in each citation. If a work is cited in translation, the translator should be named in the first reference.

*Unpublished Manuscripts. * Titles of dissertations should be cited as follows: Priscilla Ann Miner, “Eleventh and Twelfth Century Latin Epigram” (Ph.D. diss., University of California, Berkeley, 1970), 119–20. A simple description of a manuscript should not be put within quotation marks or capitalized as a title: cartulary of Saint-Jean-des-Vignes, notarial accounts, collected letters.

*Citing Manuscripts.* On first use, manuscript citations should give the city or town first, the name of the depository, the collection, the reference number, and, where necessary, a folio reference: Rouen, Bibliothèque municipale 1382 (U. 109). The British Library (BL), Bibliothèque Nationale de France (BnF), Bibliothèque nationale, Biblioteca nacional, and Biblioteca nazionale (BN) are abbreviated thus. If the citation includes references for recto and verso, these should be put in roman type and on the line, not superscripted: fols. 45r–47v. Column designations should be superscripted: fol. 45ra–b.

After the first reference, the manuscript reference should be shortened. If the abbreviation is less than obvious, it should be explained at the first citation. Examples of full and shortened references: BL Cotton Nero A. i (Nero A. i); BL Add. MS 26789 (Add. MS 26789); BnF MS Lat. 16112, fol. 45 (Lat. 16112, fol. 45); Madrid, BN MS 34568 (BN 34568); Oxford, Bodleian Rawl. B. 27 (Rawl. B. 27); Rouen, Bibliothèque municipale 1382 (U. 109) (Rouen 1382); Cambridge, Corpus Christi College 990 (CCCC 990); and York Minster MS XVI D2 (York XVI D2).

**THE APPARATUS CRITICUS**

*Printing the Critical Edition of a Text.* When an article includes a critical edition, textual variants are best set as numbered footnotes to words in the text rather than as references to lines in the text. Since line-length changes when a text is typeset, the critical apparatus would require extensive renumbering at the proof stage if references are made to line numbers.

Variant manuscripts should be denoted in the apparatus criticus by single, upper case, bold letters. Abbreviations should be listed alphabetically or in some convenient way as a preface to the text. Manuscripts are listed in descending order, from the most complete to the least complete copy:

**P** = Paris, BnF Lat. 314

**L** = BL Add. MS 18382

**Z** = Zaragoza, Biblioteca universitaria, MS 41 (olim 225)

The word or phrase in the text for which a variant is supplied is set off by a right bracket. Variants are given in roman type followed (with no comma between) with the manuscript abbreviation in bold. If more than one variant is given, these are separated by a space, not a comma: 5 teneatis] affigatis **LZT** commendetis **B**. Long phrases should be denoted by giving the first and last words separated by ellipsis points: 102 quicquid . . . ideo] *om.* **T**

Authors who wish to prepare a critical edition using Classical Text Editor (CTE) should consult directly with the editor-in-chief before submitting their article for submission.

**IMAGES**

Authors are responsible for securing the required licenses to images prior to publication. In general, images should be at least 300 dpi. Consult the following: [https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/authors/journals/journals-artwork-guide](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/authors/journals/journals-artwork-guide).

**CAPTIONS**

Captions should give full identification of the image, location, and date, and include a photo credit.

**OPEN ACCESS**

If you are interested in publishing your article Open Access (OA), consult the following: [https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/authors/publishing-open-access](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/authors/publishing-open-access)
