*George Hong*,* PhD*

Chief Research Officer and Associate Provost for Research

Welcome to the Office of Research at Fordham University. Our mission is to foster and advance research discovery, development, and delivery across the University. We support faculty, students, and staff through a wide range of incentive, service, and recognition programs.

The Office of Research is organized into four core units and services such as Sponsored Programs, Research Initiatives, Research Compliance, and Technology Transfer. They are all dedicated to strengthening sponsored research, interdisciplinary scholarship, global collaborations, faculty–student partnerships, and individual faculty research.

We oversee a broad research infrastructure that includes the Office of Sponsored Programs, the University Research Council, the Research Deans’ Council, the University Research Compliance Council, the Institutional Review Board, and Fordham’s research consortia, institutes, centers, and compliance committees.

Our office also promotes internal and external opportunities such as [Faculty Fellowships](/academics/research/faculty-research/faculty-fellowships/); [Fordham’s partnerships with Columbia, NYU, Georgetown, and IBM](/academics/research/office-of-research/initiatives-and-infrastructure/internal-funding-opportunities/fellow-and-intern-programs/); [the Faculty Research Abroad Program](/academics/research/office-of-research/initiatives-and-infrastructure/faculty-research-abroad-program/); and other funding initiatives. Most recently, Fordham co-founded the Global Research Alliance of Jesuit Universities (GRAJU) and joined the AI Alliance to host [the Symposium on Responsible AI](/academics/research/office-of-research/events/symposium-on-responsible-ai/).
