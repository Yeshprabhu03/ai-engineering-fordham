# Export Controls

Export Controls refer to a variety of U.S. federal laws and regulations controlling what commodities, technologies, software, and services may be sent to foreign locations or disclosed to foreign persons. The purpose of these is to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests from malign foreign actors who may wish to access our most advanced and useful technologies.

“Export” can refer not just to physically carrying, for example, encrypted software to an embargoed country, but also allowing a postdoc from an embargoed country to view sensitive materials here on the Fordham campus.

While these laws do provide exclusions for “fundamental research”, the criteria under which the exclusions apply are narrowly defined and it can be unclear in some cases whether an activity or item falls under these laws and therefore requires an export license. The Department of State has provided [an overview](https://2009-2017.state.gov/strategictrade/overview/index.htm) as well as a compilation of [red flags and watch lists](https://2009-2017.state.gov/strategictrade/redflags/index.htm).
