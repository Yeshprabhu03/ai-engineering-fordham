## Purpose and Significance

The ongoing AI revolution presents unprecedented opportunities and complex challenges for higher education, industry, and society at large. Unlike traditional software systems, AI systems powered by machine learning exhibit two key characteristics:

- Dependence on vast datasets, which raises critical concerns around privacy, data rights, provenance, and bias.
- Non-deterministic outputs, which introduce new risks related to trust, safety, reliability, and security.

Given the growing application of AI across nearly every sector of society, it is essential that we deepen our understanding of both the use and governance of these technologies.

At its core, Responsible AI seeks to foster the development of trustworthy AI systems that promote discovery and informed decision-making for the common good across both cyber and physical domains. Achieving this vision requires interdisciplinary collaboration that spans the sciences, social sciences, humanities, public health, law, business, and education, as well as meaningful partnerships with industry, government, and civil society.

** The Symposium on Responsible AI** brings together scholars, practitioners, and professionals from across the greater New York City area and beyond to advance this collaborative mission. The event is designed to strengthen cross-institutional networks and foster dialogue around the ethical, legal, and sustainable dimensions of AI. Open to the public and held in person, the symposium will feature keynote speeches, selected paper sessions, interactive workshops, and networking opportunities aimed at building a more responsible AI ecosystem.

We have confirmed the following four keynote speakers: 1) Ben Brooks, Harvard University; 2) Julia Stoyanovich, NYU; 3) Anthony Annunziata, IBM; and 4) Doni Bloomfield, Fordham University

## Symposium Focus Areas and Topics

**A) AI Regulation & Frameworks**

This track explores the evolving legal and regulatory landscape surrounding AI, with an emphasis on accountability, compliance, and ethical oversight.

- Legal implications of AI applications across sectors
- AI in legal services: Opportunities, challenges, risks, and ethical considerations
- The role of AI in the courts: Evidence, reliability, case law, and due process
- Global AI governance: The EU AI Act, U.S. Executive Orders, NIST AI Risk Management Framework, and other emerging policies
- Accountability in AI systems: Legal liability, regulatory compliance, and social responsibility across the public and private sectors (higher education, industry, government, tech company, and NGO)
- Human-centered design and environmental considerations
- System integration and deployment challenges

**B) Trustworthy AI**

This track focuses on the ethical, technical, and social foundations for building AI systems that are transparent, fair, secure, and aligned with human values.

- Transparency and explainability: Addressing the "black box" nature of AI
- Embedding human values: Promoting reliable information, non-discrimination, and the common good
- Mitigating bias and advancing fairness in algorithmic decision-making and scientific discovery
- Quality management in AI development: Testing, evaluation, implementation, and supply chain integrity
- Ethics and accountability: Navigating ethical dilemmas and responsibility in cases of AI failure
- Data infrastructure and governance: Ensuring data privacy, quality, rights, and provenance
- Security and sustainability: Designing AI systems to be robust, secure, and environmentally sustainable
- Social justice in AI: Advancing equity, inclusion, and responsibility in autonomous and agentic AI systems
- Leveraging open-source tools: Creating, evaluating, and deploying AI using open and collaborative technologies
