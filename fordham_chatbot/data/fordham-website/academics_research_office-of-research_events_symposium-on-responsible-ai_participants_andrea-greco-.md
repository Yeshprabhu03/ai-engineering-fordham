In particular, the session will examine and, where possible, address the following questions:

(a) What are the current achievements and challenges in the design and implementation of RAI systems and infrastructure?

(b) What actions can and should we take to advance RAI in the future?

(c) How can we enhance RAI by responsibly integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with human intelligence (HI) and natural intelligence (NI)?
