**Abstract:**

Market failures associated with prices that do not represent the social benefits and costs of economic actions lead to an inefficient allocation of resources. Climate change is a result of such a market failure, and the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) into the economy faces several related challenges. To control the extent to which the growth of AI contributes to the climate crisis and places disproportionate burdens on certain members of society, two such potential market failures must be overcome to avoid potential harm to society: 1) a failure to charge AI consumers the true price of using AI tools and 2) a failure of electricity markets to charge technology companies the true cost of increased electricity production.
