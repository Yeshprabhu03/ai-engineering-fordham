**Abstract:**

Workshop Title: From Assistant to Research Partner: A Hands-On Introduction to Agentic AI Tools and Workflows

Description: AI agents are rapidly evolving from experimental tools to essential research collaborators. This 60-minute hands-on workshop introduces scholars to agentic AI through an equity-focused lens, emphasizing practical applications in social and health research. Participants will explore leading frameworks—LangGraph, Smolagents, OpenAI’s Agent SDK, AutoGen, CrewAI, and Dify—highlighting their strengths, limitations, and ethical considerations.

The session features real-world case studies, including:

● AI role-play agents for training social-work students

● Automated qualitative coding of interview data

● Multi-agent pipelines for rapid literature reviews

● Scalable fact-checking of health misinformation

Participants will observe the live construction of two mini-agents—one with Dify’s no-code interface, and another using Smolagents to showcase core API and prompt engineering. No coding experience is required; all templates and notebooks are provided.

Takeaways:

● Understand agentic AI’s research potential and statistical impact

● Choose the right tool for specific research goals

● Leave with a prototype agent ready for adaptation

● Learn ethical best practices for socially responsible deployment

By the end, attendees will be equipped to integrate agentic AI into their research workflows as powerful, principled partners.
