# Fordham Research Fellow and Research Intern Programs

## Fordham-Columbia, Fordham-NYU, Fordham-IBM, and Fordham-Georgetown Research Fellow and Research Intern Program Guidelines, 2026

**I. Purpose**

The Fordham-Columbia, Fordham-NYU, Fordham-IBM and Fordham-Georgetown Research Fellow and Research Intern Program is designed to promote and expand research collaborations among the four institutions. The review committee will select Fordham faculty members (Research Fellows) and Fordham students (Research Interns) to work collaboratively with Columbia, NYU, IBM and Georgetown scholars, scientists, and students on a research project in the summer of 2026. Selected Fellows and Interns will be allowed to conduct their research remotely, if applicable.

**II. Process**

A. All Fordham tenured and tenure-track faculty members are invited to submit their applications to the Office of Research by ** March 1, 2026**.

B. The Fordham Chief Research Officer (CRO) will work with the University Research Council (URC) and Research Deans’ Council to review these applications. After consulting with the Provost and the four institutional partners, the CRO will select Fordham faculty members as Research Fellows.

C. Each selected Research Fellow is encouraged to recommend up to one Fordham undergraduate or graduate student to serve as the project Research Intern during the summer of 2026.

D. The Research Intern must be a current full time and degree seeking Fordham student through August 2025 with a GPA of 3.0 or above. CRO will consult with the students’ deans to make the final decision.

E. Each Fellow applicant should submit a brief statement of how the student will participate in the project and the student’s resume to CRO ([[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)) by ** March 15, 2026**.

F. The summer program will be held from ** May 15 to August 15, 2026** but the term can be extended or adjusted if all stakeholders agree.

G. This program does not affect the Research Fellow’s Fordham Faculty Fellowship or other Fordham internal awards/grants; however, applicants must select only ** one of the four **institutional partners—Columbia, NYU, IBM or Georgetown.

H. Selected Fordham-Columbia Fellows and Interns must follow the Columbia Faculty Handbook’s Guidelines for Visiting Scholars/Scientists and Seminar Associates ([http://www.columbia.edu/cu/vpaa/handbook/visiting.html](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/vpaa/handbook/visiting.html)).

I. Individuals collaborating with New York University may be required to obtain the appropriate institutional designation—specifically, Visiting Scholar status for faculty members and Volunteer status for students—and must adhere to all applicable University policies and procedures. Selected Fordham-NYU Fellows may also be required to sign a NYU standard research intellectual property agreement.
