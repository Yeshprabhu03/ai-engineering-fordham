# Fordham AI Research Grant (FAIR)

**Objectives**

The FAIR initiative will provide pilot funds to stimulate interdisciplinary AI research projects. The larger objective is to increase the visibility of Fordham in interdisciplinary AI research and to allow faculty to leverage preliminary results obtained with this funding to acquire larger external awards. Thematic areas can include interdisciplinary sponsored research and collaboration in areas studied at Fordham, with emphasis on supported areas not limited to AI and ethics, AI and law, AI and community engagement, AI and security, AI and systems, AI and mathematics, and AI and humanities.

The proposal should clearly indicate how the funding would achieve both of the objectives, i.e. aligning AI research with Fordham's strategic priorities and securing external funding for interdisciplinary AI research at Fordham. While all interdisciplinary research proposals will be given full consideration, priority for funding this year will be given to interdisciplinary AI research collaborations across departments, and/or across colleges and schools.

**Details:**

- Applicants may apply for up to a maximum of $10,000 over a maximum of one year.
- Applicants are required to identify externally funded opportunities through RFPs from specific agencies, ensuring that selected opportunities generate Indirect Cost (IDC).
- Applicants are eligible to receive the award up to three times in five years.
- A two-step payment process will be implemented as follows:

1. 50% of the awarded funds will be available upon approval of the application.

2. The remaining 50% will be accessible when the Principal Investigator (PI) successfully submits the external grant proposal.

Funding will be available for projects beginning October** **1, 2025 concluding by June 15, 2026. Proposals for shorter periods and lesser amounts are also encouraged.

**Budget**

The Office of Research (OR) will provide professional development funds supporting:

- supplies, materials, software licenses;
- salary (or fees) for external consultants, technicians, or contractors, research assistants, and graduate students;
- research related travel, but not for travel to scientific, academic or professional meetings/conferences (except in exceptional cases, e.g., where interdisciplinary conference participation is crucial to research objectives); recipients must adhere to the
[University Travel Policy](https://www.fordham.edu/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/office-of-finance/about-us/finance-groups/treasury-and-risk/travel-and-expense-reporting/travel-and-expense-policy/?utm_source=SilverpopMailing&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Updates%20to%20the%20Travel%20and%20Expense%20Policy%20(1)&utm_content=)and may need to submit an international travel request form to Fordham’s International Travel Risk Assessment Committee (ITRAC) that will forward its recommendation to faculty member's dean or vice president to determine whether the proposed travel is pre-approved; - equipment; recipients must adhere to the Laptop First
[one device per person policy](https://www.fordham.edu/information-technology/it-services/laptop-first/); - costs of convening research team meetings; and,
- other justifiable research expenses.

Faculty salaries and indirect costs are not allowable expenses. Faculty members who will have received three months' summer salary supported by external grants are not eligible to apply for the program if their research efforts take place during the summer.
