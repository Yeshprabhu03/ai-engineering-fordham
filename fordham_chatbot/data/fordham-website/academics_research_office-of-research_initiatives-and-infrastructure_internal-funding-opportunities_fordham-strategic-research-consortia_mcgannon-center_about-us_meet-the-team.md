# Meet the Team

**Jessica Baldwin-Philippi - Director**

Jesse is an Associate Professor in the Communication and Media Studies department at Fordham, and affiliated with the New Media and Digital Design Program. She researches digital politics--both digital political campaigning and municipal innovation initiatives. Her first book, Using Technology, Building Democracy, chronicles the rise of social media campaigning from 2010-2014, and investigates its implications for how everday citizens are expected and encouraged to take political action. She is currently writing a book about data campaigning as well. In the realm of municipal governance, she has researched cities' development and deployment of efficiency apps (think 311 reporting apps), public internet access hubs and networks (think LinkNYC and hotspots), and games and interactive designs for community planning.

At Fordham, Jesse teaches courses in internet studies, digital advocacy and strategy, civic media, and digital media, race, and gender to both undergrads and MA students in the MA in Public Media. She also leads, along with Lauri Goldkind, Fordham's Public Interest Technology initiative.
