Please join us on November 20th at 4:30pm as we welcome Julie E. Cohen for a panel discussion on her latest book, *Between Trut**h and Power: The Legal Constructions of Informational Capitalism, *published by Oxford University Press on Oct. 1, 2019.

Cohen is a Professor of Law and Technology at the Georgetown University Law Center. She teaches and writes about surveillance, privacy and data protection, intellectual property, information platforms, and the ways that networked information and communication technologies are reshaping legal institutions. In this talk, she will discuss her newly released book project which provides an account of how our current legal system, adapted to provide accountability for industrial-age harms, is becoming more attuned to providing accountability for information-age harms amid struggles over ownership of information-age resources.

This book event will be co-sponsored by the McGannon Center and the Digital Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Colloquium.
