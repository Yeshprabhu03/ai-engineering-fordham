**Synopsis**: Philanthrocapitalism has been conceptualized as a new way of doing philanthropy, a strategy that takes business-thinking from the for-profit capitalist world and applies it to social projects and programs, spurring innovation and scaling-up solutions to global challenges along the way. This talk explores the intersections between philanthrocapitalism and media, using the work of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and other major power-players in the humanitarian world as examples, with a particular focus on food and agricultural policy. From the use of celebrity partnerships to the funding of specific filmmaking and journalistic endeavors, philanthrocapitalists have worked hard to set the media and policy agendas in a way that matches their social concerns and aligns with their metrics-oriented and technologically-savvy styles.
