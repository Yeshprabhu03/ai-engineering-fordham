Join the McGannon Center staff for lunch and a discussion with Ralph Vacca on participatory and inclusive design processes on Friday, April 6, 2018. We’ll be in room 3-08 at Fordham’s Law School, located at 150 West 62nd St., New York, NY 10023. Lunch will be served at 12:30 p.m. with discussion to follow.

Ralph Vacca’s teaching and research focuses on participatory design and culture. His current work focuses on how participatory design processes can empower marginalized groups and restructure ideas about the importance of diversity and cultural inclusivity in design. He employs a mixed-methods, critical-empirical approach that combines the theories and methodologies of media studies, cultural studies, and human-computer interaction.
