### July 9, 2020, 12:30 - 2:30 p.m. Via Zoom Webinar

*Wealth of Networks*, Daniel Solove's

*The Future of Reputation*, James Boyle's

*The Public Domain*, Tim Wu's

*The Master Switch*, Siva Vaidhyanathan's

*The Googlization of Everything*, Christina Dunbar-Hester's

*Low Power to the People*, and Simone Browne's

*Dark Matters*.

Last year, we awarded the book prize to Virginia Eubanks for writing *Automating Inequality*, an elegant and incisive account of the toll that automated decisionmaking systems have on the most vulnerable recipients of government services. This year, with this award to *Ghost Work*, we turn our attention to the unsung human laborers that make the newest technologies work as marketed. *Ghost Work* is the latest in a recent line of research, including [ Anatomy of an AI System by Kate Crawford & Vladan Joler](https://anatomyof.ai/) and

[, that chronicles the political economy underlying today's most popular networked services. The McGannon Center promotes research that uncovers the lived social impacts of communications technologies. We are honored to associate ourselves with](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300235883/behind-screen)

*Behind the Screen*by Sarah Roberts*Ghost Work*through this year's award. And we are grateful to Gray and Suri for writing it.

### About the Program

Last January, the McGannon Center announced that[ Ghost Work: How to Stop Silicon Valley from Building a New Global Underclass](https://t.e2ma.net/click/2zmdkf/uh37ho/ikt0f3) (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt) by

[Mary L. Gray](https://t.e2ma.net/click/2zmdkf/uh37ho/ycu0f3)and

[Siddharth Suri](https://t.e2ma.net/click/2zmdkf/uh37ho/e5u0f3)had won our book prize for a manuscript published in 2019. As we explained then,

*Ghost Work*offers an important nuance to common perceptions about the ways in which the most celebrated AI-driven consumer applications and products today (think Uber, Amazon's Echo, or Facebook's News Feed) significantly depend on underserved on-demand workers from around the world. Gray and Suri draw on extensive interviews and data analytics to show that this large, invisible, and mostly unsupported workforce is essential to such things as geolocation, online payment systems, and content moderation. This human labor, they illustrate, is essential to fixing glitches and gaps, but remains obscured by claims from Silicon Valley and their boosters about full automation and the power of AI.

The July 9 event will have three parts. First, Gary and Suri will talk about the key findings of the book, as well as more contemporary questions concerning, for example, Facebook employees' recent pushback against CEO Mark Zuckerberg's statements about the company's laissez-faire approach to misinformation and work stoppage efforts at Amazon across the country in light of concerns about COVID-19. In the second part,

[Sarah Roberts](https://t.e2ma.net/click/2zmdkf/uh37ho/uxv0f3)(UCLA) and

[Lilly Irani](https://t.e2ma.net/click/2zmdkf/uh37ho/aqw0f3)(UC San Diego), leading scholars of tech work, will set out their reactions to

*Ghost Work's*main findings. In the third part of the July 9 event, we will pull away from

*Ghost Work's*specific focus on tech work and turn to

[Kimani Paul-Emile](https://t.e2ma.net/click/2zmdkf/uh37ho/qix0f3)(Fordham) and

[Sam Roberts](https://t.e2ma.net/click/2zmdkf/uh37ho/6ay0f3)(Columbia) who will draw on their research to discuss healthcare workers, another underserved workforce, and the problems they endure. They will focus especially on the ways in which people of color are, on the one hand, disproportionately represented among this workforce and, on the other hand, the likeliest in the general population to suffer from COVID-19.
