# Everett C. Parker Book Series

The Donald McGannon Communication Research Center’s [ Everett C. Parker Book Series](https://www.fordhampress.com/series/donald-mcgannon-communication-research-centers-everett-c-parker-book-series/) is devoted to the publication of research that addresses social and ethical issues in communications policy. Published by

[Fordham University Press,](http://www.fordhampress.com/)this series seeks to publish research that can inform the work of policy makers, scholars, and students as they grapple with today’s rapidly changing communications environment and the variety of policy issues arising within it. This series employs a broadly defined notion of communications policy, in that it considers not only scholarship addressing specific policy issues, but also more broadly focused communications scholarship that has implications for policymaking.

This series is particularly focused on publishing inter-disciplinary work that integrates research and advocacy in support of communications policies that serve the public interest. The series commemorates the work of Everett C. Parker, a founding figure in public interest communications policy activism, founder of the McGannon Center, and a pioneer in the linking of communications research with policy advocacy.

**Specific topics of interest for this book series include:**

*The adaptation and formulation of communications policy principles for the new media environment.*- Policy issues emerging from new media technologies.
- The changing dynamics of the relationship between media institutions and their audiences, and the policy implications of these changes.
- International and comparative communications policy research.
- The past, present, and future of communications policy advocacy.
- The relationship between policy research, policy advocacy, and policy making.
- The performance and evolution of policy making and governance institutions.
