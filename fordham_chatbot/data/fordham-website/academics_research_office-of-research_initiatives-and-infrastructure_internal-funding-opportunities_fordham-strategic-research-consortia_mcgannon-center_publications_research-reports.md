**Marc Cooper: Digital Society Project**

The Digital Society Project is an ongoing research initiative led by McGannon Center Affiliated Scholar Dr. Mark Cooper. The principle of ubiquitous access to an open communications network has been at the center of U.S. communications policy throughout its history. Reflecting this principle, preserving the basic institutional and and economic relations that have contributed to the immense success of the Internet are the primary objectives of the Digital Society Project. This project seeks to extend Dr. Cooper’s history of analysis and involvement to preserve these core values as the Public Switched Telephone Network transforms into the public digital communications network. Research produced through the Digital Society Project thus far:

**Margot Hardenbergh: The TV Oral History Project**

With the support of grants from the Markle Foundation and the Ford Foundation, the McGannon Center has been developing an archive of in-depth interviews with important figures in the history and development of the television industry in the United States, with a particular emphasis on regulation and policy issues and events.

These interviews are being archived at Fordham University’s Walsh Library, and ultimately will be available on-line for research and teaching purposes. It is hoped that the TV Oral History Project will prove a useful resource for students, scholars, industry professionals, and others interested in developing a greater understanding of the history and evolution of the U.S. television industry. The lead interviewer for the TV Oral History Project is Margot Hardenbergh, faculty member in the Department of Communication and Media Studies. The interviews are now accessible [online.](http://digital.library.fordham.edu/cdm4/browse.php?CISOROOT=%2FORALHIS)
