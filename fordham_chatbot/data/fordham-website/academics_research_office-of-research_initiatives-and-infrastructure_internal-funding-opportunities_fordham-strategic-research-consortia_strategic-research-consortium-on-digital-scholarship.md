**About the consortium:**

In 2017, Fordham University has established the Strategic Research Consortium on Digital Scholarship (aka the Digital Scholarship Consortium) based on the unanimous recommendation of the University Research Council. This effort is inspired by the Continuous University Strategic Planning (CUSP) goal that the University should “Identify and invest in selected areas of current and future strength in research and scholarship” (II.A.1).

Broadly speaking, digital scholarship encompasses the use of new technologies to advance methods of inquiry and scholarly communication, as well as research on digital technology and media. The initial focus of Fordham’s Digital Scholarship Consortium are the intersections of digital technology and media with central components of the university’s mission — cultivating knowledge and wisdom and advancing social justice.
