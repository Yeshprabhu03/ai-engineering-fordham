Areas of Research:

International and comparative politics; global migration; interstate cooperation; political economy; civil conflict; and post-conflict reconstruction.

Dr. [Sarah P. Lockhart](/academics/departments/international-studies/faculty/sarah-lockhart/)’s research interests lie at the intersection of international relations and comparative politics, particularly in the areas of migration, political economy, and conflict. She is the co-editor of Introduction to International Migration: Population Movements in the 21st Century (Routledge 2021) and the co-author of Migration Crises and the Structure of International Cooperation (University of Georgia 2018). She has also written about the implications of international efforts to combat human trafficking and smuggling, and the potential of international efforts to protect migrant rights. Her earlier work, including her dissertation, The Post-War Dilemma: War Outcomes, State Capabilities, and Economic Development after Civil War, examined the ways in which civil war outcomes and state capacity affect the post-war strategies of important economic actors, and how these strategies in turn affect post-war economic growth. Currently, she is interested in how efforts to enhance international cooperation on “migration management” may impact human security in countries of origin and transit, especially during times of conflict or crisis.
