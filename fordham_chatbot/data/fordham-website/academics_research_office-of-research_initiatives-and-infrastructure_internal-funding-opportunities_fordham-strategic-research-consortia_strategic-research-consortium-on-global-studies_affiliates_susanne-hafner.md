Dr. [Susanne Hafner](/academics/departments/languages-and-cultures/faculty/susanne-hafner/)'s research centers on Medieval European Literature and Culture and the lasting impact of our Medieval heritage on our society. In one of my current projects, I explore the migration of oriental "trophy wives" from the crusader states to Europe and the culture shock experienced by these women (and even more their children) in their new home. My work on "Orientalizing Victuals" is a culinary glossary of animals and foodstuffs which similarly were considered an import from a faraway country, correctly or not. In a more detailed study, I am looking at the manifestations of the trauma experienced by the citizens of Medieval Modena after a horrendous flood.
