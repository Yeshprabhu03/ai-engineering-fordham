# Large Proposal Grant Writing Fund

We are pleased to announce a new Office of Research funding initiative, the Large Proposal Grant Writing Fund, effective on September 1, 2021. The Fund will support professional grant proposal writing services for tenured and tenure-track faculty members who are preparing a proposal for a large grant with a total budget of over $1 million in direct costs. The proposal needs to provide indirect costs to the University with priority given to applications for grants that provide full indirect cost return at Fordham’s federally negotiated rate.

Up to three applications will be funded per academic year at $10,000 each on a first-come-first-served basis. Awarded funds will be paid directly to the grant writer or grant writing service. Faculty members may not apply to the Fund more than once per academic year. Awarded faculty (PIs) will be responsible for selecting the writing service providers.

Applications for this fund must be submitted a minimum of 4 months in advance of the grant proposal submission deadline. All faculty members requesting support must commit to a successful submission of their grant proposal.

Applicants are eligible to receive the award up to three times in five years.

Applications for the Large Proposal Grant Writing Fund should be sent via email to Dr. George Hong at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f18b999e9f96c5b1979e839599909cdf949584) and Rebeca Franco at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6f001c1f2f09001d0b070e02410a0b1a). Funding requests should include the applicant’s name, the name of the professional grant writer or grant writing service, and a link to the funding opportunity announcement to which the applicant is responding.
