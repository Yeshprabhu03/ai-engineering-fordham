# Sponsored Research Travel Grant Program

The Sponsored Research Travel Grant program is targeted at assisting faculty in preparing an external funding proposal. These Travel Grants will be available to assist tenured and tenure-track faculty members who are preparing or developing external grant, fellowship and scholarship proposals.

Travel funds may be used to support travel related costs, such as meeting with program officers in Washington, D.C., or participating in grant, fellowship and scholarship workshops on proposal preparation.

Requests for the External Funding Preparation Travel Grant may be sent via email to Dr. George Hong at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#add7c5c2c3ca99edcbc2dfc9c5ccc083c8c9d8). Requests should include the applicant's name, a brief explanation of the use of the funds, and the Request for Proposal (RFP) or information about the targeted programs.

Recipients must adhere to the [University Travel Policy](https://www.fordham.edu/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/office-of-finance/about-us/finance-groups/treasury-and-risk/travel-and-expense-reporting/travel-and-expense-policy/?utm_source=SilverpopMailing&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Updates%20to%20the%20Travel%20and%20Expense%20Policy%20(1)&utm_content=) and may need to submit an international travel request form to Fordham’s International Travel Risk Assessment Committee (ITRAC) that will forward its recommendation to faculty member's dean or vice president to determine whether the proposed travel is pre-approved.

Grants will be awarded ;on a first-come, first-served basis; faculty members will be eligible to receive up to $500 per academic year toward the cost of their travel expenses. The number of grants and the amounts awarded for this program may be adjusted periodically based on need and availability of funds. The grants will reimburse faculty for specific travel costs relating to proposal preparation.

Once the travel is completed, awardees may access their Travel Grant funds by submitting the following documents in hard copy ONLY:

- The appropriate and completed Fordham Accounts Payable paperwork, with everything but budget numbers and authorizing signatures.
- Original receipts, invoices, and proof of payment.

These materials should be sent to:
