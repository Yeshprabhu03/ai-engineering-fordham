# University Research Council

The University Research Council (URC) is a standing Presidential Committee that seeks to "formulate University research policies and procedures" and report these initiatives to the University President.

By statute, the URC draws its membership from across the University's undergraduate, graduate and professional schools.

The URC seeks to create a supportive and enabling environment for research at Fordham.
