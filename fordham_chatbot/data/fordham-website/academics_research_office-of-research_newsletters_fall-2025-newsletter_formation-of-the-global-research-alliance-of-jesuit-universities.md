## Formation of the Global Research Alliance of Jesuit Universities

**Inaugural Symposium of GRAJU in the Philippines in March 2026**

The Fordham Office of Research and the Office of the Provost are pleased to announce the formation of the Global Research Alliance of Jesuit Universities. The inaugural symposium of the GRAJU will be held at Ateneo de Manila University in the Philippines on March 10-13, 2026.

By leveraging the power of Jesuit international higher education, the Office of Research worked with the Office of the Provost in laying the groundwork for a GRAJU. Over the past semester, the OR has had meetings with representatives of Ateneo de Manila University, Sogang University in South Korea, and Sophia University in Japan. Below are some of the details of these meetings in 2025, which were instrumental in establishing the GRAJU.
