Fordham University and Sophia University in Tokyo co-organized a two-day conference at Fordham's Lincoln Center campus this past March. The conference explored the intersection of immigration, artificial intelligence, and social justice. It featured keynote speeches and panel discussions that addressed these overlapping issues and presented interdisciplinary solutions. Keynote speakers and panelists included Fordham researchers and external guests from IBM's Research Lab, and Fragomen, a law firm specializing in immigration law. Discussions and Q&A sessions illuminated the complexities of these challenging problems, often proposing workable solutions. Fordham Now published [an article](https://now.fordham.edu/university-news/how-should-ai-be-used-in-immigration-cautiously-experts-say/) highlighting some of the key points from the invited speakers' talks.
