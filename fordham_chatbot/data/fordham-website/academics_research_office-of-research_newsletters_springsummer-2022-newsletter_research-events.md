Fordham’s second Research Day took place at the Fordham Law School on April 25, 2022. During this year’s event, the Office of Research sponsored our first new book exhibition designed to showcase more than 70 books published by our faculty. Seven new book authors gave talks on their books. Dr. Jeffery Sachs, Columbia University, delivered a thought-provoking keynote about the role of the university in supporting sustainability.

## 2. Research Consortium on Science and Justice – May 3, 2022 Kick Off Event

More than 30 participants attended the official launch of the Strategic Research Consortium on Science and Justice, held via Zoom. The director or co-director of the three previously established research consortia delivered speeches relating to science and justice issues. Steve Franks explained the focus of the science and justice consortium’s goals. In Franks’ original proposal, he states:

"This initiative is designed to help foster justice-centered research through the science programs at Fordham. It will facilitate active collaboration with colleagues and students to produce new research output across current justice issues."

Provost Jacobs and Chief Research Officer Hong also gave introductory remarks in strong support for this newly formed research consortium and its primary objective of addressing the causes of justice and equity via faculty research.
