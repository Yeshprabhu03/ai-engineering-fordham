![Student looking at beaker - LG](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/fordham_042508_0508.jpg)

Our mission is to help University personnel locate and secure funding for projects that will:

- Generate knowledge in the various disciplines and professions represented in the University
- Enrich the educational experience of students
- Enhance the reputations of the University, schools, departments and personnel involved in those projects

**Our office is responsible for reviewing and approving external funding applications for all grants, contracts and sub-contracts.**

We work closely with the [Office of Institutional Giving](https://www.fordham.edu/info/26513/corporate_and_foundation_relations) on foundation grants, and the [Office of Legal Counsel](https://www.fordham.edu/info/21686/legal_counsel) on contract negotiation.
