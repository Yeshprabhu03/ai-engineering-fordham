There are two types of research funding available. External funding is funding like scholarships, fellowships, and grants offered by outside sources. Internal funding is funds offered within Fordham to only Fordham students. Please follow the links below for more information.

Make sure you seek out faculty who can advise you about outside funding opportunities that are not included in this list.

### External Funding

Explore the opportunities listed in the [Scholarships and Fellowships](/academics/student-fellowships/office-of-fellowship-advising/find-scholarships-and-fellowships/) section of our website. This is just a list of major awards to help you get started.

We also suggest that you research other opportunities not listed here. We have several popular search engines for you to navigate.

Fellowships, also called grants or scholarships, are awards of money given to support a variety of activities both in the U.S. and abroad.

These include:

- Formal coursework and language study abroad
- Independent projects and research
- Internships
- Community and public service
- Tuition or dissertation support

Contact the Office of Fellowship Advising if you have made some progress toward a fellowship application.
