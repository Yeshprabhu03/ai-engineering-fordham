## Fordham Recognized as a Fulbright Top Producer for Second Year in a Row

With 15 awardees in 2024-2025, Fordham has again been recognized by the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs as a [Top Producing Institution](https://www.fulbrightprogram.org/fulbright-top-producing-institutions/) -- a result of the wrap-around support our faculty and advisors provide. Our 15 alumni are serving as cultural ambassadors in 12 countries on four continents, from Ghana to the Slovak Republic to Taiwan!

### Everyone Can Apply

Are you active in an extracurricular club or activity? Are you passionate about creating positive change in your community?

Everyone can apply–undergraduates and graduate students, alumni, academic achievers and enthusiastic learners, dedicated leaders and energetic volunteers. Eligibility varies by fellowship and there is a wide range of awards available, addressing a variety of subjects that attract a variety of students. You don't have to be at the top of your class to receive an award.

And the process of applying itself is valuable. You will learn how to write about yourself and articulate your plans for the future–skills that will help you apply for internships, jobs and/or graduate school later.
