# About the Office of Fellowship Advising

At the Office of Fellowship Advising, also known as the Campion Institute, we connect students with opportunities.

A fellowship or award is a scholarship that can fund you to do exciting things that will enhance your college experience.

- Study Overseas
- Conduct Research in Your Field
- Serve Your Community
- Attend Graduate School
- And more!

Are you active in an extracurricular club or activity? Are you passionate about creating positive change in your community? You don’t have to be at the top of your class to receive a fellowship. Everyone can apply–undergraduates and graduate students, alumni, academic achievers and enthusiastic learners, dedicated leaders and energetic volunteers.

Eligibility varies by fellowship and there is a wide range of awards available, addressing a variety of subjects that attract a variety of students.

And the process of applying itself is valuable. You will learn how to write about yourself and articulate your plans for the future–skills that will help you apply for internships, jobs and/or graduate school later.

We will guide you through the entire process, whether that’s

- searching for a fellowship that fits your goals;
- drafting application essays; or
- preparing for interviews with selection committees.

It's our job to make sure you have all the support you need.

We can’t wait to meet you!
