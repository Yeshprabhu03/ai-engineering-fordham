# Director of the Office of Fellowship Advising

## Welcome from the Director

It is my great privilege to welcome you to the Office of Fellowship Advising, also known as the Campion Institute!

Here, we work with all Fordham undergraduate students, graduate students, and alumni on national and international awards. Some of these help fund graduate study… others support you to undertake international experiences, research opportunities, and service.

We love getting to know you, hearing about your goals and aspirations… and thinking with you about what you can apply for. We then help you through every step of the process.

Please get in touch with us… even if you are not sure this is for you. The sooner the better, because these applications generally take months to put together.

We are looking forward to getting to know you!

Dr. Lorna Ronald
