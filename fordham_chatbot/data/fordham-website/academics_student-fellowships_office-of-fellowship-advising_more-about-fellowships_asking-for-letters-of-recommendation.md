# Asking for Letters of Recommendation

We encourage you to take time to get to know professors in your field so that you can learn from them about their academic trajectory and careers. In addition, these relationships can turn into mentoring opportunities as they share advice about your own path.

## Participate in class, go to office hours!

When you are starting to think about applications, reach out to the professors you know well to talk with them about your goals and plans. It’s a good idea to reach out with plenty of time (2-3 months before any deadline) to talk with them. You can ask them then if they would be willing to write a letter that would strongly recommend you for the opportunity.

If you need further guidance, we are here to support you.
