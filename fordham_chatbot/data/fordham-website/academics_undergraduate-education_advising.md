Our academic advisors and class deans will support your growth throughout your time at Fordham—and set you up for success in college and beyond.

In keeping with the Jesuit spirit of *cura personalis*, we aim to provide you with the attention and resources you need to ensure your academic success through the development and care of your whole self.

With our guidance and support, you will be empowered to be an active, engaged, and independent learner. You'll be ready to draw on Fordham’s multitude of resources and take advantage of the many opportunities the University provides.

## Fordham College Advising

Throughout your time at Fordham College at Rose Hill (FCRH) or Fordham College at Lincoln Center (FCLC), your advisors will help you explore your academic, career, and life goals. They'll also help you identify the courses, enrichment activities, engagement opportunities, and resources that will help you meet your goals.

## Gabelli School of Business Advising

Gabelli School students are offered a vast array of curricular choices, experiential and service-learning options, international experiences, extracurricular activities, and internship and career possibilities. Advising staff members are committed to helping students understand these opportunities in a compassionate, supportive environment.
