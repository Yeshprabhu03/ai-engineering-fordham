# Liberal Arts Core Curriculum

At [Fordham College at Lincoln Center](/fordham-college-at-lincoln-center/academics/core-curriculum/) (FCLC) and [Fordham College at Rose Hill](/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/academics/core-curriculum/) (FCRH,) our Core Curriculum is the foundation of our liberal arts education, a set of courses that will help you explore passions, discover new interests, and broader your perspective. You'll learn to think on your feet, analyze and synthesize information, articulate your point of view, make logical decisions for the good of your colleagues and community, and adapt to changing circumstances.

In small classes, you'll get to know your professors and your peers, forming meaningful relationships that inspire you.

Academic advisors at [FCLC ](/fordham-college-at-lincoln-center/academics/)and [FCRH ](/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/academics/)will help you navigate it all, from choosing classes to charting your path after graduation.
