### A Passion for Learning

The
[Honors Program at Fordham College Lincoln Center](/fordham-college-at-lincoln-center/honors-programs-societies-and-awards/honors-program/) is an opportunity for talented and motivated students to explore many areas of learning in a small intellectual community of student scholars and faculty. The program is limited to approximately 19 students in each year who are selected at the time of admission to Fordham College Lincoln Center. Each class is advised by a faculty member who stays with the group throughout their four years.

### Honors Graduates Receive More Than A Degree

Since its founding in 1950,
[Fordham College at Rose Hill Honors Program](/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/honors-programs-societies-and-awards/honors-program/) has provided exceptional students with the opportunity to pursue their core studies in greater depth, breadth and intensity. Drawn from every major, Honors students share a passion not just for learning, but for thinking about what they learn. Professors in the Program foster lively discussion, provoke analysis of texts and ideas, and provide students with the ideal opportunity to grow personally and intellectually in the context of small, seminar-style classes.

### Rigorous and In-Depth Learning

The four-year
[Global Business Honors Program](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/undergraduate-programs/honors-programs/global-business-honors-program/) selects incoming first years with stellar high school academic records and prepares them for high-level roles in the world's most dynamic firms and organizations. The 25 students in each GBHP class form a close-knit community of friends and scholars.
