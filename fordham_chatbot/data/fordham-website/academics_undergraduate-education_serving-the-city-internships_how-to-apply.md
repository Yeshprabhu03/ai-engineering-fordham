# How to Apply

[Serving the City](/academics/undergraduate-education/serving-the-city-internships/) internships are designed exclusively for Fordham College at Lincoln Center (FCLC) and Fordham College at Rose Hill (FCRH) students. All students at each college are eligible to apply for these positions as long as they will be enrolled at Fordham for the entirety of the internship.

**What types of internships are available?**

There are opportunities in the arts and humanities, education, communications, marketing, community engagement, and more. Internships vary in duration, total hours, and hours per week, but all are comparable to part-time employment in expected hours and payment.

Summer internships often involve fewer weeks but more hours per week. Internships can be in person, fully remote, or hybrid.

Please note: These internships are not for course credit.

**I am an FCLC/FCRH student looking for a paid internship. How do I find these internship opportunities?**

Interested students should log into [Handshake](https://fordham.joinhandshake.com/login) (Fordham's Career Center job and internship database) and filter postings according to the “Serving the City” tag. This filters and shows only the active paid Serving the Cityinternship postings.

**An internship has piqued my interest! How do I apply, and what happens next?**

Applications will be submitted directly to the partnering organizations via Handshake. [Learn more about using Handshake and Career Center resources](https://www.fordham.edu/resources/career-resources/career-center/career-development-resources/using-handshake/).

Note that partnering organizations manage the application and interview process. They call candidates with whom they would like to meet, conduct interviews, and select a final candidate. Once this is confirmed by the organization, the student, and Fordham University, the internship can begin. The stipend is distributed directly from Fordham to the student.

Please note that you may only have one internship at a time.
