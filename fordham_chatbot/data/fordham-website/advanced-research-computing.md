# Research Computing

**For Faculty, Staff**

## Overview

Faculty use Research Computing services to conduct research and experiment with innovative technology projects. It is a virtual service space for faculty who can administer their projects independently, with background IT support available.


## New High Performance Computing (HPC) Magis Cluster

Faculty and student researchers requiring significant computational power can now use the Magis Cluster, Fordham’s new high-performance computing system (HPC). Magis is a 56 Teraflops cluster that has separate Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) equipped with 64,000 CUDA cores, meaning it can handle multiple computationally intensive tasks in parallel at a high speed. We will soon be adding Grace-Hopper GPUs to further enhance Magis's capabilities.
