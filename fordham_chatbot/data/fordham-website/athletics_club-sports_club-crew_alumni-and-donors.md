## Alumni and Donors

Since Fordham Men's Crew is a club sport, our team relies entirely on funding from our alumni and supporters throughout the country. We want to thank all of those who have chosen to donate, particularly those who helped send us to the ACRA Championships this year, allowing our team to take home its first ACRA national title.

We sincerely appreciate all of the support we get from you all, and we hope to continue to provide you with great racing and the continuation of this program’s historical success.

If you are looking to donate to the team, you can do so below, and we encourage all supporters and alumni to subscribe to our newsletter below to stay updated on results and team events hosted throughout the school year.
