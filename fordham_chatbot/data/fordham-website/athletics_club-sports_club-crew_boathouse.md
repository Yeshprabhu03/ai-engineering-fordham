The Harlem Yacht Club, founded in 1883, is one of the oldest yacht clubs in the United States. It has been based on City Island since 1894. This unique New York City community is the gateway to the cruising grounds of Long Island Sound to the east and New York City to the west.

This is currently the home of both the Fordham Men's and Women's rowing programs. There are plans underway to construct a facility for both the rowing and sailing programs at a nearby venue also on the Long Island Sound.
