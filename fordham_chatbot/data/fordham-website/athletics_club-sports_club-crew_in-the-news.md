**Oak Ridge, TN. - Fordham Men's Crew takes gold at ACRA National Championships**

On May 20th, 2023, the team was able to send a boat down to the ACRA National Championship in Oak Ridge, TN for the first time in years. With only one entry in the Lightweight 4+, the squad comprised of Emma Barson, Sebastian Gwitt, Adin Deljanin, Aiken Zhou, and Nate Siwiec, all part of the class of 2025.

The first day of heats went well for the boat, as they were able to cruise down the course winning their heat by 14 seconds and placing 2nd overall going into finals by a margin of 3 seconds. After a helpful film session and some very motivational TV programming, the boat came into finals with something to prove. Not to disappoint, the squad got out to an early lead and held it the whole race, winning the race by open water. A truly dominant performance.

This was a huge step for the program, as it was the first ACRA gold medal in team history and the first national championship in decades.

**Cherry Hill, NJ. - Fordham Men's Crew has two podium finishes at Dad Vail Regatta**

On May 12th, 2023, the team took a trip down to the Cooper River for the biggest race of the season, and what would be the final race for almost everybody. With entries in the Lightweight 4+, JV 4+, Novice 4+, and Varsity 2- this would be one of the most eventful regattas of the year.

The Varsity 2- kicked off the regatta with two of the grittiest races of their season, earning them a hard-fought 2nd place and the team’s first medal of the regatta. Not to be outdone, the JV 4+ fought hard against some very stiff competition and shocked everyone by making the Grand Final. Against competition like Drexel and Temple, the boys showed their grit and finished in 6th place, an unexpected and impressive result. The Novice 4+ followed suit, also shocking their competition and making it into the C Final, a great result for a boat of true novices. Finally, the Lightweight 4+ polished the trip off with the most exciting race of their season. The final ended up being a dogfight down the course with Fairfield and Delaware, and the boys came up just short taking 3rd by only 0.3 seconds, good for Fordham’s second podium showing.

**Fordham Men’s Crew Has Highly Successful 2023 Spring Season**

With so many “firsts” for the team, the future of the program looks bright. Stay tuned for more results, as the team looks to come back in the fall, stronger than ever.
