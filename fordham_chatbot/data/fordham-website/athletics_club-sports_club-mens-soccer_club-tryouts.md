# Club Tryouts

FUMCS is very excited to be back for the 2023 season! We will let you know what day/time you will be trying out a day or two before the tryout. We look forward to seeing you all out there!

The Fordham Men's Club Soccer Team was founded in 2009 as a place for competitive soccer players at Fordham to continue playing the game they love at a high level, and we are proud to keep that mission alive for current students today. We have enjoyed great success in recent years, winning four consecutive league titles and traveling the country to compete in regional and national tournaments.
