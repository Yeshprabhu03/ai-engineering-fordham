Fordham has two campuses in New York City, the arts, commerce, fashion, finance, media, and sports capital of the country. Our Lincoln Center campus is located in the heart of the cultural core of the USA, and our Rose Hill campus, adjacent to the New York Botanical Gardens and the Bronx Zoo, is one of the most beautiful college campuses in the east. The resources of New York City provide Fordham students with a wide variety of internships from which to choose, including companies on Wall Street, Madison Avenue, and the non-profit sector.
