## Club Ultimate Frisbee

Club Women's Ultimate Frisbee are a group of motivated individuals who compete across the region and country in Division 1 college women's ultimate frisbee. We have a passion for teamwork, frisbee, growth, and fun. Since its founding in 1997, The Flying Jesuits have always reached for the stars! But The Flying Jesuits is never vast enough--we are looking for you to help our team grow.

The current iteration of the Fordham Club Mens Ultimate Frisbee team was founded in 1995. The identity they created back then still holds true today, and big footprints are left on the prep field that new players and veterans alike try to fill. Though we do not play in a local league, we frequently leave the safety of Fordham University big black gates and explore other areas and schools in the tri-state areas for tests of vigor and bravery known as tournaments.

Starting in 2022, the Club Men's Ultimate Frisbee team and the Club Women's Ultiamte Frisbee team have united to become a singular Club Ultiamte Frisbee team! If you would like to know more about the team, join the team, or contact the team, email us!
