# Club Women's Squash

Fordham University Women’s Club Squash aims to provide a fun and competitive environment for student athletes of various levels. It’s a great way to stay in shape, meet new people, and learn a new sport! We hold practices and matches against other schools throughout both the fall and spring semesters. Students interested in learning more about the team should contact us.

**Historical Performance**Women’s Club Squash is a very active member of the squash community. They compete through the Collegiate Squash Association and attend Nationals annually.

**Prospective Athletes**Women’s Club Squash holds tryouts every Fall and the team is always looking for new members to add to the roster. No experience is necessary to try out for the team, and we have many current members who had none prior to joining.
