**Outdoor Soccer Rules and Policies**

**Players and Substitutions**

- Teams will consist of seven players (6 field players and a goalkeeper). A minimum of at least six players are required to start play.
- Substitutions are only allowed in the following situations:
- When a ball goes out on the end lines or sidelines (goal kicks, corner kicks, or throw-ins)
- When a player is injured and needs to come out of the game
- When a goal is scored


**Start of Game and Game Time**

- Choice of sides and the kickoff will be decided by rock, paper, scissors. The team winning the toss will have the choice of side or kickoff. The second half will begin with kickoff by the team that did not have it in the first half.
- At the referee’s whistle, the game will be started by a player taking a place kick from the center of the field into the opponent’s half of the field. Prior to the kick, each player shall be on his or her respective sides of the field. A goal may not be scored directly from kickoff. The player who kicked off may not play the ball again until another player has touched the ball. An indirect kick is awarded if this occurs.
- Two 20-minute halves will be played with a 2-minute halftime period.
- The clock shall run continuously without stopping throughout the game except during team or official timeouts and the last two minutes of the second half. During the last two minutes of the second half, the clock will stop on every whistle and resume when the ball is returned to live play.
- One 30-second timeout is allowed for each time during each half.
- Ties will not be broken in regular season play. In playoffs, ties will be broken by a 5-minute sudden death overtime period (first goal scored wins). If the score remains tied, the winner will be determined by penalty kicks.

**Handball**

- A direct kick foul (and potentially a penalty kick) if a player (other than the goalkeeper inside his own penalty area) delibertately handles the ball. This measn to deliberately touch the ball with any part of the arm from the finger tips to the top of the shoulder.
- A hand ball should not be called if a player is instinctively trying to protect themselves from injury or if the player did not deliberately touch the ball but the ball hits their arm and they did not move the arm toward the ball.
- If a players arm is in an unnatural position, such as above their shoulders or sticking out to the sides, then they should be called for a handball.

**Fouls**

- Handling the ball with hands or arms, holding the opponent, placing hands or arms on an opponent in an attempt to reach the ball, pushing, striking, tripping or attempting to kick an opponent and slide tackling are all considered direct free kick fouls.
- Playing the ball a second time before it has been played by another player during a kick-off, throw-in, corner-kick, or goal-kick, subtitution when the ball is not dead, interfering with the goalie and dangerous plays are all considered indirect free kick fouls
- Depending on the severity of the foul, players may be issued yellow cards or red cards
- Major fouls, such as aggressive slide tackling, fouls with intent to injure, fightning, excessive and/or recurrent unsportsmanlike conduct will be penalized with red cards. Straight red cards are counted as two yellow cards and result in immediate ejection. The team must play short-handed for the remainder of the game.

**Penalty Kicks**

- Awarded for any infringement of rules by a defending player within the penalty area.
- The penalty kick shall be taken from any spot on the penalty mark and all players except the kicker and the goalkeeper must be at least 10 yards behind the kicker.
- The goalkeeper must stand, without moving the feet, on the goal line between the goal posts until the ball is kicked.
- If a goal is not scored, the ball remains in play, is live and may be played.
- Encroachment by the defending team is not penalized if the goal is scored. If it is not scored, the penalty kick is retaken.
- Infringement by the attacking team is penalized if the goal is score and the kick is redone. If it is not scored, there is no rekick.
