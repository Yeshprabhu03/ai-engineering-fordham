**BRONX, NY – July 10, 2025** – Fordham University today broke ground on the Bronx Green Jobs Center, the new home for a pioneering initiative designed to serve as a vital bridge connecting talented Bronx residents to New York’s rapidly expanding green economy. In close partnership with the community, this first-of-its-kind green economy hub will deliver best-in-class job training, employment services and support for aspiring entrepreneurs in sustainable industries, helping community members access good-paying jobs in innovative and high-demand fields that are shaping the future. The initiative is supported by a significant investment from Fordham University and public and private contributors, including the New York State Dormitory Authority, New York City Economic Development Corporation, New York City Council, and the One Girl Foundation.

The Bronx Green Jobs Center is set to open in Fall 2026 and aims address specific areas of this burgeoning demand, including:

**Electric Vehicles (EVs):**With the number of personal EVs in NYC surging from 4,000 to over 27,000 since 2016 and statewide numbers exceeding 180,000 – in addition to thousands of commercial and public vehicles transitioning to electric -- there is an urgent need for trained workers to install and maintain the necessary charging infrastructure.**Solar:**The federal Bureau of Labor Studies forecasts a remarkable 48 percent job growth for solar photovoltaic installers through 2033, a trend likely to be amplified in NYC due to high energy costs and ample rooftop space.**Energy Efficiency:**This rapidly evolving field is creating new positions and requiring retraining for existing trades like electricians, HVAC installers and insulators. Industry experts anticipate over 60 percent growth in New York's energy efficiency jobs through 2030.**Urban Farming and Agriculture:**The rise of urban farming locations across NYC is opening up significant entrepreneurial avenues within the sustainability economy.

“The start of construction on the Bronx Green Jobs Center is an exciting first step in this initiative that will combine our deep expertise in STEM education and our ties to our Bronx community to help power the future of New York’s green economy,” **said Tania Tetlow, President of Fordham University. **“With this initial investment and the collaboration of our University, government, and neighborhood partners, Fordham is preparing to train a generation of Bronx-based green economy leaders.”

Renovations will transform more than 12,000 square feet of former industrial space at 585 East Fordham Road – which originally housed a billiard hall and most recently served as a carpet store shuttered more than a decade ago – into [a state-of-the-art facility](https://www.fordham.edu/bronx-green-jobs-center/). The space will feature modern lab and learning environments for hands-on training, New York’s first dedicated green economy entrepreneurship center, a welcoming event space capable of hosting up to 200 attendees, and a streetside café offering locally produced goods.

Fordham University has coordinated an extensive community-driven process in development of the Bronx Green Jobs Center, work that will continue over the coming year as the site at 585 East Fordham Road is transformed. The University is actively engaging a diverse coalition of prospective partners, including institutions of higher education, employers, organized labor, community- and faith-based organizations, and leaders in the environmental justice field. This collaborative approach will shape and sustain the Bronx Green Jobs Center vision, ensuring it fulfills a dual mission of advancing economic opportunity for the Bronx community and contributing to environmental stewardship.

New York's green economy is experiencing substantial growth, presenting a significant opportunity for local workforce development. New York City’s Green Economy Action Plan aims to supercharge the economy, spark cutting-edge innovation, and support the nearly 400,000 green-collar jobs by 2040. Economists estimate that New York will add 172,000 new jobs statewide in the clean energy sector by 2030.

"As New York City cements its status as a global hub for the green economy, NYCEDC is laser-focused on developing collaborative workforce development and entrepreneurship hubs to prepare New Yorkers throughout the five boroughs for the jobs of the future," said **New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC) Chief Strategy Officer Cecilia Kushner**. "We are thrilled to select Fordham University and the Bronx Green Job Center as our first awardee of the Greenlight Innovation Fund. The Center delivers on the City’s Green Economy Action Plan by bringing together academic excellence, community development and job readiness programs to prepare Bronx residents for green careers."

"The Bronx Green Jobs Center is more than just a building, it is a blueprint for economic justice and climate resilience in the Bronx,” **said Congressman Ritchie Torres.** “For too long, our borough has borne the brunt of environmental neglect while being left behind in the new green economy, but this initiative is working to flip that script. It will empower Bronx residents with the skills and opportunities to lead in solar, clean energy, and sustainable innovation. We must put the Bronx at the forefront of New York’s green future, and this project will do just that. I commend President Tetlow and Fordham University for their leadership and vision in bringing this transformational initiative to life."

“I am excited to join members of the community and Fordham University in breaking ground for the Bronx Green Job Center at the heart of our District,” **said New York City Council Member Oswald Feliz.** “This new space is a critical step in bringing more equitable opportunities to our constituents, as they deserve a space where they can enjoy access to innovative jobs and experiences. Investing in our community is one of my top priorities, and I am looking forward to seeing the new opportunities that will be brought to our borough and residents.”

“Fordham has shown what it truly means to be a community partner, not just through education, but through deep, sustained investment in the people around them. They listen, collaborate, and show up where it matters,” **said Meaghan Barakett, Fordham University alum and trustee and founder and CEO of One Girl.** “That’s exactly what One Girl is built on: the belief that lasting change begins with community. This partnership works because we share that vision, that when you invest in a community’s ability to lead, thrive, and shape its own future, the impact is transformational. This isn’t charity, it’s shared ownership, dignity, and a true commitment to progress.”

"The Green Jobs Center will provide Bronxites with the skills and support they need to thrive in New York’s booming green economy, from solar energy and electric vehicles to energy efficiency and urban farming. I am so proud to represent Fordham University and grateful to President Tetlow and Travis Proulx for their leadership in making sure that the Bronx will not only be a part of New York’s clear energy future, it will be a home to the hub leading the way," **said State Senator Gustavo Rivera.**

“The opening of the Bronx Green Jobs Center is a huge game-changer for our borough that will equip our residents with the essential skills they need to thrive in this emerging industry,” **said Bronx Borough President Vanessa L. Gibson.**“This initiative is more than a workforce program; it’s a step toward long-term economic and environmental sustainability that uplifts families, breaks the cycle of poverty, and builds a stronger middle class here in the Bronx. I want to thank Fordham University for investing in this project and watering the seeds of a greener, more prosperous future for our borough.”

“Fordham University has strengthened relationships and built community around Community Board 6 and beyond,” **said Aleyna Rodriguez, Executive Director of Mary Mitchell Family and Youth Center. **“Our strong partnership with Fordham has expanded the Mary Mitchell Center’s programs, outcomes, and impact. The Bronx Green Jobs Center will open even more doors—bringing together community-based organizations in this field to equip Bronx residents with the resources, training, and opportunities they deserve.”

“We are proud to strengthen Fordham’s community relationships with the launch of the Bronx Green Jobs Center, which will be a vibrant, innovative employment and entrepreneurship hub *for *Bronx residents, developed in partnership *with *and *by *Bronx residents,” **said Travis Proulx, Vice President for External Affairs at Fordham University. **“Through this collaboration we are bringing stakeholders to the table and working together to ensure that this dynamic green jobs center serves the needs and aspirations of our community.”
