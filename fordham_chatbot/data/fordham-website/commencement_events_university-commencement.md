# University Commencement

Fordham’s Commencement is divided into two events: the University Commencement Ceremony and the school diploma ceremonies. All graduates are invited to attend the **University Commencement Ceremony on Saturday, May 16 at 10 a.m.**. At this ceremony, degrees are officially conferred by the president and students are recognized as a group by their dean.

Following the University Commencement Ceremony, individual school ceremonies take place. These ceremonies are where students are individually announced and receive a ceremonial scroll from the dean. **The school diploma ceremonies typically end by 3 p.m.**

## Tickets

**Tickets are not required** for entrance to the Rose Hill campus for the University Commencement ceremony on Edwards Parade. Most school diploma ceremonies take place outside and do not require tickets.

**Tickets are required in the event of severe weather and the ceremonies move indoors.**

More information on claiming **two** severe weather only tickets will be shared by the dean's offices with students in early May.

## Assembly of Candidates

on Saturday, May 16

All graduates should arrive at the appropriate lineup site near Keating, Spellman, Tierney, and O'Hare Halls no later than 9:30 a.m. with their cap, gown, and hood (which are required to participate). Signs will be posted that day to assist you in finding the exact location for your college or school. Faculty marshals will be there to assist you in lining up for the procession.

At approximately 9:45 a.m., the procession will begin to move to the entrance of Edwards Parade. The academic procession will begin at 10 a.m. at the sound of the Victory Bell. As the oldest of Fordham's schools, Fordham College at Rose Hill leads the procession.

## Alcoholic Beverages

Alcoholic beverages, including champagne, are not permitted at the University Commencement and diploma ceremonies. Any graduate or guest found with alcohol may be asked to leave campus.

## Bags

Backpacks and other large containers should be left at home. All bags are subject to screening upon entry to Fordham's campus. To expedite your entry into campus, Fordham encourages the use of clear plastic bags. While guests are permitted to bring food and non-alcoholic beverages to campus, glass containers and bottles will not be allowed.

## Bookstore Hours

The hours of the University Bookstore, located in O'Hare Residence Hall (next to the parking garage), are 8 a.m. - 5 p.m. Bookstore items will also be available at the Bookstore Annex, near the Metro-North Station entrance to campus.

## Emergency Services

In the event of an emergency requiring medical treatment, seek the assistance of uniformed security personnel who will contact emergency medical teams. In addition, registered nurses are on duty at the Health Center located in the basement of O’Hare Hall from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Commencement Day.

## Food Service

Food service is available at several on-campus locations from 7:30 a.m. until after the diploma ceremonies.

## Livestreaming

All ceremonies will be livestreamed on the Commencement website: [fordham.edu/commencement](https://www.fordham.edu/commencement).

## Moving out of the

Rose Hill Residence Halls

Cars are not allowed to drive on the campus roadways until after all diploma ceremonies have ended at approximately 4 p.m. Due to the large number of pedestrians on campus, we must close the campus to all but essential vehicles before and during the ceremonies.

## Photographs

The best opportunities for individual photos are at the school diploma ceremonies, not the University Commencement Ceremony. In addition, there will be a professional photographer at the diploma ceremonies who will photograph the graduates as they receive their diplomas from the dean. Students will receive proofs from the photographer and may order prints directly from Island Photography ([https://www.islandphoto.com/](https://www.islandphoto.com/)).

At all times, we ask that individuals taking photos or videotaping be considerate of others in the audience.

## Restrooms

Many campus buildings are open, and blue signs will direct you to restrooms. Ushers can also direct you to open facilities. Accessible restrooms are located in Dealy Hall, Freeman Hall, Hughes Hall, Houlihan Park, under the Jack Coffey Field bleachers, Larkin Hall, O’Hare Hall, and Walsh Family Library. Portable restrooms are also located between Campbell and Salice Halls.

## People with Disabilities

All ceremony locations are accessible, and all accessible restrooms will be clearly marked. There is no designated wheelchair seating at the ceremonies. However, you can pull up your wheelchair to any row at the ceremonies for seating. Please note that Fordham is not able to provide wheelchairs for guests. The University Commencement ceremony will be videocast (rain or shine) in the McShane Campus Center, which is air-conditioned and accessible.

If someone with a physical disability is accompanying your group to the ceremonies, enter the campus through the Main Entrance on Southern (Kazimiroff) Boulevard, across from the New York Botanical Garden. From there, you will be directed to the parking garage, where there will be a golf cart tram station. The trams (which can hold a foldable wheelchair) will be running continuously throughout the day to and from the garage and all major ceremony locations. Reservations are not required for the trams, and all members of your party are welcome to ride the trams if space is available. People needing special assistance should be dropped off at the tram station while the rest of your group parks. As parking and ceremony seating is on a first-come, first-served basis, we recommend that you plan to arrive early.

Guests who need a sign language interpreter for the University Commencement or one of the diploma ceremonies should make arrangements at least two weeks in advance by contacting the Office of Disability Services at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#117578627073787d786568627463677872746251777e637579707c3f747564). Please indicate in the email which ceremonies you will be attending.
