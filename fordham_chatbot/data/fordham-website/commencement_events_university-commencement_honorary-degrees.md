## About Honorary Degrees

[Each year at the University Commencement, Fordham University honors several individuals by bestowing upon them an honorary degree. In addition, honorary degrees are also awarded during the year at special ceremonies. The awarding of honorary degrees is a way of promoting and advancing the University as a whole, and giving the University prominence and recognition among her publics. All honorary degrees must be approved by the Fordham University Board of Trustees.]

Past recipients have been honored for qualities and achievements including:

- Leadership in advancing the mission of Catholic and Jesuit education;
- Excellence in education and specifically in the areas represented by the University’s undergraduate colleges and graduate and professional schools;
- Contributions to furthering multi-cultural and international understanding;
- Service to Fordham University;
- Service to New York City and her communities;
- Contributions to our nation and society that advance humanistic values.

The University Commencement Committee solicits and screens nominees for honorary degrees to be conferred by Fordham University at the University Commencement. Recommendations from the University Commencement Committee are then made to the Fordham University Board of Trustees, which must approve the awarding of all honorary degrees from the University.

The membership of the University Commencement Committee includes members of the Board of Trustees, alumni, faculty, administrators, and students. The Committee is chaired by the University Secretary whose office provides staff support for the committee.
