## Banners of Fordham University

A set of academic banners depicting the distinguishing characteristics and proud history of each of the Schools, Colleges, and other major constituent groups of the University was commissioned for Commencement 2004. The name of each of these groups (rendered in Latin) encircles the central shield, while the founding date of each is marked across the buckle at the seal’s base. Crowning each banner illustration are the Greek letters of the name of Jesus, taken from the coat of arms of the Society of Jesus.

In 2016, the class banners were commissioned. The Class of 2023 banner is being carried by Class Marshals who will lead the candidates for degrees.

All the individual banner illustrations relate visually to the composition of the Great Seal of Fordham University (shown above).
