### Ordering Your Cap and Gown

Caps and gowns are provided through [Herff Jones](https://colleges.herffjones.com/college/fordham/). If you place an order before the deadline of March 14, your cap and gown will be available at the distributions listed below, but only at the campus selected while ordering. Be sure to bring your email confirmation along with your student ID card.

Please keep in mind that your student account must be paid in full or appropriate arrangements made before picking up your cap and gown. Also, you must have applied online to graduate through [fordham.edu](http://fordham.edu/) or have the permission of your dean.

If you did not preorder your gown online, you may still come to one of the distributions and receive a cap and gown on a first-come, first-served basis. (Extras will not be available at the Westchester distributions.)

Bachelor’s and master’s candidates (except for the School of Law) are given keeper gowns and therefore do not need to be returned. All doctoral rental gowns must be returned following the ceremonies.

Wearing Your Academic Attire

The gowns and colors of academic dress indicate the graduate’s level of academic accomplishment, discipline, and school/university affiliation. We ask for graduates’ cooperation in not modifying academic attire with personal items that may distract from the academic ritual.

The cut of the gown identifies the degree. The bachelor’s gown has pointed sleeves, while the master’s gown has oblong-cut sleeves. The doctoral gown has bell-shaped sleeves typically crossed with bands of velvet.

The length of the hood indicates the level of the degree. The color of the velvet border indicates the field of learning in which the degree was earned and includes white for arts, gold for science, brown for fine arts, dark blue for philosophy, light blue for education, purple for law, citron for social service, and drab for business. The inner lining of Fordham hoods is maroon, the University’s official color.

For the academic procession at the University Commencement, graduates carry the hood draped over the left arm with the color that represents the degree clearly visible. Candidates don their hoods after the president has conferred all degrees. The hood should be placed around your neck and shoulders so that the major portion hangs down the back and the velvet is up. The cord on the front of the hood should be fastened to your clothing. The bachelor’s and master's cap is worn with the long point of the shell to the rear and the tassel you will receive to the left. Doctoral candidates wear a tam which has an attached tassel.

Undergraduate students in Fordham College at Rose Hill, Fordham College at Lincoln Center, and the Gabelli School of Business should also wear their cap and gown (but not hood) to their respective college awards ceremonies on Friday, May 15.
