# Travel Information

The University Commencement brings more than 20,000 people to the Rose Hill campus, which makes parking a major challenge. Therefore, we strongly encourage the use of public transportation to Rose Hill on May 16.

We are fortunate to have the Metro-North Harlem and New Haven line trains literally at our doorstep and recommend you consider the train if traveling from Manhattan, Westchester County, or Connecticut. For detailed schedule information on the Metro-North trains, visit the MTA website at [mta.info/mnr](https://mta.info/mnr).

## Parking at Rose Hill

Limited complimentary parking will be available on the Rose Hill campus for Commencement-related events. The GPS address for parking and campus map can be found on our [Directions to Rose Hill](https://www.fordham.edu/info/20962/maps_and_directions/4657/directions_to_rose_hill/) page.

Parking will also be available free of charge at G&R Parking Garage (Fordham Plaza) on May 16 only. Enter on 189th Street between Washington and Third avenues (one block south of Fordham Road) and walk one block north to the Rose Hill campus through the Third Avenue or Bathgate Avenue entrances. Fordham College at Lincoln Center graduates and guests will find the garage at Fordham Plaza is closer to their diploma ceremony than the campus parking garage.
