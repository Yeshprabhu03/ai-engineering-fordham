The Faculty Senate is the representative body of the Fordham University Faculty and is composed of [25 members](/academics/faculty/faculty-senate/elected-members-of-the-faculty-senate/) elected proportionately from the faculties of Fordham's colleges and graduate schools.

We exercise faculty responsibilities for university governance through both [standing and ad hoc committees](/academics/faculty/faculty-senate/faculty-senate-committees/) and serve in an advisory capacity to the President of the University. Under the [University Statutes](/about/leadership-and-administration/board-of-trustees/university-statutes/), the Senate has the right and duty to initiate recommendations and to speak for the Faculty in all areas of University activity.

The Senate convenes [monthly meetings](/academics/faculty/faculty-senate/faculty-senate-meetings/) from September through May.
