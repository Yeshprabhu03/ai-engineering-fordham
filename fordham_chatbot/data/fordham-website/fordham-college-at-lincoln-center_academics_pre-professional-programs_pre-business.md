## Pre-Business Initiative

The pre-business program brings resources, faculty, employers, and alumni together to offer services to liberal arts students pursuing business careers. The Pre-Business Program is an initiative of Fordham College at Lincoln Center intended to inform students of the usefulness of a liberal arts degree in the job market. Over the past three years, the Pre-Business Program has introduced and connected students with alumni and potential employers who have recently experienced the employment search and interview process. The overall purpose is to support our students and add another resource that may complement their academic pursuits and career planning/placement within the business sector.

The pre-business program hosts two events each semester, bringing students together with community partners and recent Fordham alumni. It recently introduced a "speed networking" program that allows one-on-one interaction with our students and panelists. A bio is prepared and distributed allowing students to select a mentor that may complement their own professional interests.

Panelists include young professionals who have Fordham degrees in psychology, economics, English, theatre, communication and media studies, international studies, Spanish, and theology. The guests are employed at a range of organizations including Nickelodeon, The Deal, Morgan Stanley, Blackrock, Newsweek, and International Business Times.
