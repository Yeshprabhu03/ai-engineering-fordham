# Curriculum and Coursework in Pre-Health at FCLC

Students focused on entering a health profession program such as medicine, dentistry, veterinarian medicine, nursing, or other health professional schools will require successful completion of majors-level science coursework and labs. The courses listed below constitute the minimum requirements for an application to most health profession programs, regardless of major:

- One year of general biology with lab at FCLC:
[NSCI 1403](https://nextbulletin.fordham.edu/search/?P=NSCI%201403),[NSCI 1404](https://nextbulletin.fordham.edu/search/?P=NSCI%201404),[NSCI 1413](https://nextbulletin.fordham.edu/search/?P=NSCI%201413),[NSCI 1414](https://nextbulletin.fordham.edu/search/?P=NSCI%201414)

- One year of general chemistry with lab at FCLC:
[NSCI 1321](https://nextbulletin.fordham.edu/search/?P=NSCI%201321),[NSCI 1322](https://nextbulletin.fordham.edu/search/?P=NSCI%201322),[NSCI 1331](https://nextbulletin.fordham.edu/search/?P=NSCI%201331),[NSCI 1322](https://nextbulletin.fordham.edu/search/?P=NSCI%201322)

- One year of English (satisfied by core requirements)
- One course in Mathematics (
[Math 1203](https://nextbulletin.fordham.edu/search/?search=math+1203)or[Math 1206](https://nextbulletin.fordham.edu/search/?search=math+1206))


Students planning on completing additional coursework in the sciences should note that the biology and general chemistry foundation courses, plus all applicable labs (all listed above), must be successfully completed prior to enrollment in all upper-division biology courses.

In addition, students applying to medical school are required to take the following coursework to meet the required competencies:

- One semester of biochemistry
[NSCI 4153](https://nextbulletin.fordham.edu/search/?P=NSCI%204153),[CHEM 4221](https://nextbulletin.fordham.edu/search/?search=chem+4221) - One semester of psychology
[PSYC 1200](https://nextbulletin.fordham.edu/search/?P=PSYC%201200)

- One semester of sociology
[SOCI 1100](https://nextbulletin.fordham.edu/search/?P=SOCI%201100)

- One semester of statistics
[NSCI 2040](https://nextbulletin.fordham.edu/search/?P=NSCI%201321&_ga=2.251957961.1754760781.1757513765-623736715.1743434182),[MATH 1205](https://nextbulletin.fordham.edu/search/?P=MATH%201205),[SOCI 2606](https://nextbulletin.fordham.edu/search/?P=SOCI%202606),[ECON 2140](https://nextbulletin.fordham.edu/search/?P=ECON%202140),[PSYC 2000](https://nextbulletin.fordham.edu/search/?P=PSYC%202000)


All pre-health students, no matter what their primary fields of study, should master the major concepts and skills of science and mathematics, and are generally advised to take additional upper-level science coursework to help prepare for standardized entrance exams. Subtle variations in this coursework may be necessary for application to programs specific to each discipline.

Students planning to apply to a health professional school are advised to take the appropriate standardized admissions test—MCAT, DAT, OAT, or GRE—in the spring or early summer of the application year at the latest.

"The aim of natural science is not simply to accept the statements of others, but to investigate the causes that are at work in nature."
