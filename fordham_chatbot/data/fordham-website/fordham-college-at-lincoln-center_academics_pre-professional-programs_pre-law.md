**Pre-Law Advising**: Fordham offers an extensive pre-law advising program for our students considering law school. Students at Fordham are able to meet one on one throughout their years at Fordham for advising to discuss courses, majors, strategies for applying and being accepted to law schools, legal careers and internships, and any other questions they have about becoming a lawyer.

**Pre-Law Symposium**: We offer a pre-law symposium course directed primarily towards first-years and sophomores interested in law school, but open to any student of any year at FCRH and FCLC. This course covers different types of legal careers, admissions strategies, test prep, mock law school case analysis and general pre-law advice. Previous speakers have included partners in major law firms; high ranking lawyers in government agencies and the non-profit sector, Deans of Law Schools, and Admissions Deans from area law schools. Many of our speakers are Fordham alumni.

**Course of Study**: The American Bar Association does not recommend any particular undergraduate major to prepare for a legal education. Research, writing, and analytical skills are some of the primary skills needed in law school, so students are encouraged to take coursework that will help them develop and refine these skills.

**Clubs and Activities**: Both FCRH and FCLC offer a pre-law society student club, which focuses on programming of interest to pre-law students, such as admissions and test prep strategy sessions. We also offer our award winning mock trial team on both campuses. Internships: Many pre-law students choose to take advantage of our New York City based campus, located in the vicinity of many law firms and government agencies, and participate in legally related internships. Some students intern with government agencies, while others gain experience working at law firms. Our career services office offers an extensive job and internship database, Handshake, which includes legally related job and internship listings.

Students may also apply to Fordham University Law School during the regular application cycle as a senior or graduate. In recent years, Fordham undergraduate has been one of the top feeder colleges into Fordham’s law school.

**Pre-Law Summer Institute at Fordham Law School**: Fordham law school offers a Pre-Law Institute during the summer months, which undergraduates can choose to participate in. It offers both a credit and non-credit option to undergraduate students. The institute covers an introduction to law school and legal careers, and features several of Fordham law school’s faculty in the program.
