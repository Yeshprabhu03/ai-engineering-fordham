Fordham College at Lincoln Center has one of the smallest, most selective Honors Programs in the nation. We admit approximately 19 students per year. Admission into the program is by invitation only.

If you’ve been invited to join the Honors Program at FCLC, we’re sure you’ve also received offers from other excellent academic institutions. But we’re comfortable saying that no one else can offer what we do. We’re also confident that you can go anywhere after the Honors Program at Lincoln Center.

FCLC Honors students benefit from a streamlined version of the core curriculum, concentrated into their first two years. In their first year, FCLC Honors students take their core classes together in seminars designed especially for them by some of the college’s best faculty members. In their second year, FCLC Honors core classes are taught off-campus, including a New York City history class that meets at [New York Historical](https://www.nyhistory.org/) and an art history class taught at the [Metropolitan Museum of Art](https://www.metmuseum.org/).

A rigorous, accelerated liberal arts and sciences core curriculum allows most Honors students, after the first year, to pursue a double major or an interdisciplinary major plus a minor. All Honors students are required to attain proficiency in a language other than English. The structure of the program encourages spending a semester or even both semesters of the junior year studying abroad. Students who stay at Fordham for their junior year pursue an internship, community service project, or mentored research.

In the senior year, Honors students pursue independent research toward a thesis or creative project, working together in a thesis workshop in the fall. In their final semester, they take a capstone values seminar together while continuing to hone their senior research projects, which they present publicly at the end of the semester.
