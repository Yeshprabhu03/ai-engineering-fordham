*“To me, the FCLC Honors Program represents something more than a scholarly program. It represents a journey, a journey that has challenged me just as much as it has inspired me to reach my fullest potential and unlock the door to knowledge, creativity, and innovation. Why this journey has been particularly meaningful to me is because I, having struggled with severe imposter syndrome, nearly dropped out of the Program during my freshman year. Looking back, my ultimate decision to remain in the Program was, more than anything, a decision to embark on a path that not only stripped away my unfounded self-doubts and lack of confidence, but also cultivated my exceptional, multidisciplinary expertise and fervent passion for lifelong learning”* –– Alex Rivera ’24

###### *In addition, all students pursuing a BA degree are expected to complete [Fordham College's foreign language requirement](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/departments/languages-and-cultures/language-placement/). Students pursuing a BS degree are not required to complete a foreign language sequence.

[Course descriptions can be found here](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/undergraduate/honors-program-fclc/#coursestext).

During **the first year** Honors students take four honors seminars (two each semester) in philosophy, English, theology, and history. In addition, students take a full year interdisciplinary natural science and math class and workshops in writing and public speaking. Honors students pursuing a BA degree also take a year of a modern or classical language at the intermediate level or higher. (If a student starts a new language in the first year, four semesters will be required.)

In **the** **sophomore year** Honors students have more choice in their schedule. Each semester they take two interrelated Honors courses that use the resources of New York City. The other six courses taken in sophomore year are chosen by the student in consultation with the student's advisor and/or the Honors Program Director.

In **the junior year**, the student's primary focus is on the major course of study. The one Honors requirement during the junior year is to undertake an individualized study experience that will enrich your education, and then to write a reflection on the experience. Examples of the experience include:

- studying abroad in a Fordham or Fordham-approved program
- a tutorial or research project designed by the student and one or more faculty
- an internship or assistantship (e.g., work with an artist, writer, or scientist, with directed academic readings)
- a community service/mission-related project

In **the senior year**, Honors students participate with their peers in a senior thesis workshop, working on a thesis or equivalent capstone project in their chosen major. Students present their theses or capstone projects at a ceremony in the spring. During that same final semester, all Honors students come together for one last seminar, Honors Senior Values. By tradition, this course is taught by the first-year English professor, bringing together students and a professor from the very first semester and creating a "full circle" experience.

*"Teaching in the Fordham College Lincoln Center Honors Program has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my career. Teaching the science course has given me the opportunity to learn more about the physical world than I ever would have otherwise, and through my students, I have been able to experience some of our species' greatest scientific discoveries with fresh eyes. From my students and their research, I have learned about the subjects that most excite them, from neuroscience to medieval architecture to modern music"*– Jason Morris, Professor of Natural Sciences
