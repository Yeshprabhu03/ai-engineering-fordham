# Declaring a Major at Lincoln Center

The college offers majors in the humanities, social sciences, and interdisciplinary natural sciences, as well as outstanding programs in theatre, dance, visual arts, music, education, and social work. A vast array of internship opportunities, including in our signature program for paid [Serving the City internships](/academics/undergraduate-education/serving-the-city-internships/), enable students to connect real-world experience to their academic learning and make the most of the unparalleled opportunities New York City offers. Through our affiliation with The Ailey School, our students study at one of the country's premier schools of dance.

Thanks to our shared Manhattan campus, many students take advantage of Fordham’s comprehensive offerings, such as combined undergraduate/graduate programs offered jointly with Fordham's schools of Business, Law, Education, Social Services, and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, as well as undergraduate minors offered through Fordham's highly-ranked Gabelli School of Business. Distinguished authors, actors, politicians, and intellectuals regularly enrich the life of the college with talks and seminars.
