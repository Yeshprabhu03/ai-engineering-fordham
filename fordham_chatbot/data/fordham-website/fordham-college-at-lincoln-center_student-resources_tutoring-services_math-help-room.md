# Math Help Room at Lincoln Center

The Department of Mathematics offers tutoring both virtually and in person. Any student enrolled in a mathematics course at Fordham is welcome to seek tutoring support or answers to questions, free of charge.

The department hosts a virtual Math Help Room staffed by faculty;** hours vary each semester, depending on the availability of faculty and student tutors. Please consult this schedule, which is updated every semester. No appointment is necessary to come to the Help Room -- assistance is provided on a first-come, first-served basis.**

**Tutoring opportunities are also available in person; students can arrange to meet with faculty and use a variety of shared spaces on the Lincoln Center campus. **
