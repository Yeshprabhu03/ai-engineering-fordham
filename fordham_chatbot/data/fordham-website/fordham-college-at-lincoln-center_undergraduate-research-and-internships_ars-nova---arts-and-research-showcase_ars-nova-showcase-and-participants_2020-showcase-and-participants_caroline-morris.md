**Title of Research:** The United States of America versus Otto Ohlendorf, et al.: Post-War Justice in Germany

**Mentor:** Professor Edward Bristow**Abstract: **This research investigates the proceedings and effects of one of the twelve Subsequent Nuremberg military tribunal cases, *The United States of America versus Otto Ohlendorf, et al*, which tried leaders of the paramilitary death squad known as the *Einsatzgruppen*, which operated in the Soviet Union under the Nazi Party during World War II. I first describe the formation and function of the *Einsatzgruppen* and the background of the defendants, including the main defendant, Otto Ohlendorf. I outline the charges, the prosecution’s and defense’s legal arguments and justifications, and the original sentence. I then explain how and why retributive justice was actually barely executed, mainly due to changing political tides and new waves of German nationalism. I argue that, although retributive justice was barely executed after the Subsequent Nuremberg trials, the trials were instrumental in facilitating German transitional justice and cultural memory.
