**Research Partner:** Michael Marone

**Major:** Integrative Neuroscience, Computational Track

**Bio:** Connor Fierro is currently a Senior at Fordham University pursuing a major in Integrative Neuroscience on the Computational Track. He has a passion for coding, and is currently working on research using EEG technology to investigate neurological responses to hate speech. He has also worked on research in Dr. Damian Lyon's Robotics Lab, and is assisting in conducting research on Myopia Progression and Prevention at Manhattan Vision Associate's Institute for Vision Research.

**Title of Research:** Biophysiological Effects of Hate Speech as Measured by mEEG with Subjective Response Survey Correlation

**Faculty Mentor:** Mohammad Ruhul Amin, Department of Computer Science

**Abstract:** Hate speech is one of the most prominent controversies that digital society grapples with today. It has been demonstrated that interaction with hate speech has negative psychological effects on viewers. Although there have been many methods proposed for identifying, censoring, and decreasing hate speech on the internet, little research has been dedicated towards the psychophysiological impact of interacting with hate speech, such as when one encounters hate speech while web browsing or on a social media platform. As such, our research hopes to demonstrate that electroencephalogram(EEG) readings taken using a mobile EEG device (mEEG) will show differential brain activity when exposed to hate speech as compared to counter-hate speech. Furthermore, we aim to clarify whether or not certain hate speech terms that are considered more ‘emotionally charged’ actually create higher levels of neurological activity that can be used to help determine which individual terms could be classified as more or less offensive than others.
