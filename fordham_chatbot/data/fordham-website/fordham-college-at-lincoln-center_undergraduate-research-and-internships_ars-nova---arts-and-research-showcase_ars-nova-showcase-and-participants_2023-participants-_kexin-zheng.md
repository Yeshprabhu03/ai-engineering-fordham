**Title of Research:** The Effect of Internalized Model Minority Myth on Acculturation, Racism-Related Stress, Depression, Anxiety, and Self-Injury Levels Among Asian American Adults

**Faculty Mentor:** Dr. Peggy Andover, Department of Psychology

**Abstract:** Asian Americans are seldom the subject of psychological and scientific research. Emerging literature has termed this population the “model minority” that has achieved universal and unparalleled success. The model minority myth (MMM) positions Asian Americans in an intermediary realm, rendering them vulnerable as the buffer between the majority and minority groups. The endorsement of positive Asian American stereotypes obscures the heterogenous Asian American experience and assumes their immunity to mental illness. The purpose of this present study was to examine how the internalization of the model minority myth was related to acculturation and a host of adverse psychological outcomes (i.e., racism-related stress, depression, anxiety, and self-injury) and the mediating roles of internalized and perceived racism among a sample of 108 self-identified Asian American adult participants with ages ranging from 18 to 68 years. Results indicated that internalized model minority myth was only significantly related to racism-related stress. While internalized racism mediated the relationship between internalized model minority myth and Asian Americans’ acculturation to their culture of origin and other Asian Americans and depression, perceived racism mediated the relationship between internalized model minority myth and racism-related stress. Implications of these findings are discussed relative to the realities of the sui generis racialized experience of Asian Americans.
