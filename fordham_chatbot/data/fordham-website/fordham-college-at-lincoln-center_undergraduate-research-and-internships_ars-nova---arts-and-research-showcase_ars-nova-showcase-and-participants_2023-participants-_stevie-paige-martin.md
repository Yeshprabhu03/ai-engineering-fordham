**Project Title:** The Sea Shanty and its Transformations: Music of the Golden Age of Sailing and the Pirates of the Caribbean

**Faculty Mentor:** Sevin Yaraman, Department of Music

**Abstract:** This project examines the connections between the development of the Sea Shanty, a specific sub-genre of music, during the Golden Age of sailing, and the compositions of Hans Zimmer for the Pirates of the Caribbean film series. In examining these connections, it is clear that the sea shanty as a sub-genre has gone through two clear stages of transformation throughout its history; the first occurring during the twentieth century movement to collect these songs before they were lost to history entirely, and the second occurring in the ways Hans Zimmer uses particular characteristics of sea shanties in his own compositions in order to evoke emotions in his audience.
