**PROJECT TITLE:** Reconstructing Generational Trauma through Lineage Insight

**MENTOR:** tyler dennis, Department of English

**ABSTRACT: **Since my adolescence, I have been left with questions about my personal lineage. My mother, as an adoptee from Illinois’ Catholic Charities, had never searched for her biological mother. As a result, I have often wondered about who my biological grandmother was, and whether her life followed a similar path to mine, my mother’s, and even my adoptive grandmother’s. Further, I ask myself the question: are we all bound by similar life circumstances as a result of genetics, environment, or a mix of the two? To what extent? In my project, I track down my biological grandmother, and interview the women in my family to craft a self-memoir exploring womanhood through the lens of adoption.
