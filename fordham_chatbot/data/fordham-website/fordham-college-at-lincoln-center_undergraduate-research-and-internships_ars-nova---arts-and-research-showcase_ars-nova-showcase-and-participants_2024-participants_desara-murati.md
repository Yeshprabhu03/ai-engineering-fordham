**PROJECT TITLE:** The Persecution of Influential Albanians during the Communist Regime: The Case of the Group of Deputies

**MENTOR:** Dr. Thierry Rigogne, Department of History

**ABSTRACT: **This project investigates the persecution of influential Albanians under the Communist regime, with a particular focus on members of the group known as "Grupi i Deputeteve" (The Group of Deputies). Specifically, it examines whether the persecution of influential individuals, including deputies and intellectuals within the group, contributed to Enver Hoxha solidifying his authority during the early years of the Albanian Communist regime. Through an examination of archival materials, survivor accounts, and scholarly analyses, this study aims to elucidate the motivations, methods, and consequences of state-sponsored repression against individuals who held significant social, political, or intellectual positions in Albanian society. The files of "Sigurimi" are especially instrumental in providing crucial information regarding the trial and procedures for eliminating political opponents such as Shefqet Beja. By analyzing the strategies employed by the regime to suppress dissent and maintain control, this research seeks to uncover the broader implications of targeting prominent figures for ideological conformity and regime stability. Furthermore, exploring the historical context surrounding the establishment of the communist party highlights the socio-political environment in which these deputies operated. The findings of this research project suggest that Hoxha was able to consolidate control over the population through the elimination of influential figures and opponents. Ultimately, this project aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of totalitarian rule and the lasting impacts of persecution on individuals and society in Albania.
