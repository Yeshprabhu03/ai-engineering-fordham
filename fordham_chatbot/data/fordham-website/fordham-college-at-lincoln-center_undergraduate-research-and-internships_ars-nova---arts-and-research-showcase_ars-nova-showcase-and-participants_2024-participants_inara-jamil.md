**MAJOR: **Integrative Neuroscience

**BIO:** Inara Jamil is a senior majoring in Integrative Neuroscience with a cell & molecular concentration. During the summer of 2023, she worked as a Research Assistant for the Department of Natural Science at Fordham University. The research focus is to synthesize gels that can extract nitrogen and sulfur impurities in fossil fuels that contribute to acid rain. During her free time, Inara enjoys drawing and digital photography.

**PROJECT TITLE:** Analyzing the Physical Properties of Small Molecule Gelators

**MENTOR:** Marie F. Thomas, Department of Natural Science

**ABSTRACT: **Acid rain can be detrimental to animals, aquatic species, and plants. The culprit behind this phenomenon is the nitrogen and sulfur oxides released to the atmosphere due to the combustion of petroleum fuels. Fuels may be purified through the process of extraction with hybrid materials such as ion gels. Ion gels have been studied and/or used in drug delivery systems, sensors, electrochemical devices, lubricants, environmental remediation, etc. They are formed by combining an ionic liquid (an organic salt with a melting point below 100 C) with polymers, nanomaterials, or small molecule gelators (SMGs). The addition of these various substances can enhance the physical properties of ionic liquids. We have synthesized a series of possible SMGs based on the tertiary amine 1,4-diazobicylo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO). The physical properties of these quaternary ammonium salts such as melting points, and solubilities in organic solvents have been obtained. Furthermore, several of these DABCO compounds have been tested for their ability to gel acetone, ethylene glycol, and ionic liquids. The choice of organic solvents for testing was based on computational studies.
