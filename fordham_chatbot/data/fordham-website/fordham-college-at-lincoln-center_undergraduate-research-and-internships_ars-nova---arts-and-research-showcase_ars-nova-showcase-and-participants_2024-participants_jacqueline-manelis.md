**MAJOR: **Natural Science

**BIO:** As a dedicated Fordham University student on the pre-health track, I am passionate about dentistry and will be attending dental school in the summer of 2024. Serving as the President of the University Science Club, I actively engage in fostering a community of science enthusiasts. Beyond academics, I believe in utilizing my skills to heal and educate the community, evident through my commitment to assisting in dental practices, tutoring, spearheading research, and volunteering in senior centers.

**PROJECT TITLE:** Exploring gene regions: ITS and Mat-k for identifying Brassica varieties via DNA barcoding

**MENTOR:** Mary Egan, Department of Natural Science

**ABSTRACT: **Typically, gene regions such as rbcL are used to amplify plant DNA; however, it is not as successful in identifying to the species level or below (such as for identifying varieties of Brassica). Gene regions like mat-K have been shown to be informative, but mat-K may not always yield PCR results. For identifying plants, a multiple gene region barcode would be needed. We therefore examined multiple gene regions (rbcL, mat-K and ITS) for their utility in identifying plant species from DNA extracted from pollen collected by bees. In addition, we wanted to compare plant diversity between a commercial hive that is moved to different locations to pollinate crops and a stationary hive. Finally, we wanted to see if we would be able to use the DNA we extracted from pollen pellets to identify the pollinators. We sorted pollen pellets collected by bees according to color (as a proxy for species) and then used molecular methods to identify the plants and their pollinators based on DNA sequences.
