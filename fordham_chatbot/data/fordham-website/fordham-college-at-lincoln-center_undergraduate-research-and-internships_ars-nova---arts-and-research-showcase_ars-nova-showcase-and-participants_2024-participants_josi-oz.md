**MAJOR: **Natural Science

**BIO:** Josi was born and raised in NYC. She is currently a senior majoring in Natural Science on a pre-health track. Working on this project with Dr. Di Grandi over the summer inspired her to pursue scientific research as a career. After graduation, she plans on taking a gap year to obtain more work experience in laboratory work and research. She then intends on pursuing a PhD in Organic chemistry. Josi is also the secretary of Stoves Comedy Club at Fordham, and has a passion for the performing arts.

**PROJECT TITLE:** The Formylation of Primary and Secondary Amine Hydrochloride Salts with Triethyl Orthoformate

**MENTOR:** Martin J. Di Grandi, Department of Natural Science

**ABSTRACT: **Formamides are common intermediates in organic synthesis as well as solvents. While there are many methods for their preparation, many conditions require the use of toxic compounds, exotic reagents, or elevated temperature. In this project, we describe mild conditions for the formylation of primary (1º) and secondary (2º) amines using microwave heating and triethylorthoformate. We found that using these materials results in clean formation of the corresponding formamides in high yield. The conditions are simple and require minimal workup. We have developed, in collaboration with Professor Shahrokh Saba (FCRH, Department of Chemistry), a mild yet efficient method for the preparation of formamides.
