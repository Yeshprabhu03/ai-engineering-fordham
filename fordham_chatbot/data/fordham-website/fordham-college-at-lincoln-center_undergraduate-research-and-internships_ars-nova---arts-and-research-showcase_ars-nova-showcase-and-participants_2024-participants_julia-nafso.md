**PROJECT TITLE:** Ring Expansion of N-Benzyl Aziridines to 1,2,3,4-Tetrahydroisoquinolines

**MENTOR:** Dr. Martin J. Di Grandi, Department of Natural Sciences

**ABSTRACT: **This research project explores the use of N-benzyl aziridines as precursors to 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines, part of the core ring system of pancratistatin, a natural product with anti-cancer activity. Ultimately, we hope to develop sufficiently mild conditions that will allow the synthesis of pancratistatin. We demonstrated that subjecting highly oxygenated N-benzylaziridines to acids of varying strength was sufficient to effect a rearrangement that yields 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines. This modification has the potential to render the sequence enantioselective when effected with chiral sulfonic acids. Application of this ring expansion methodology to more highly functionalized N-benzylaziridines has defined milder reactions conditions, which can potentially render the reaction enantioselective.
