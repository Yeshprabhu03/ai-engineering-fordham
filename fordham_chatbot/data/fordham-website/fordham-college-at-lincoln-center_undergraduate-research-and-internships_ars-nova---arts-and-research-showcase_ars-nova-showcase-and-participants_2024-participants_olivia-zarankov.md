**MAJOR: **Natural Science

**BIO:** Olivia Zarankov is a senior in the Natural Science Department. Since summer 2022, Olivia has been working in a chemistry lab with Dr. Marie Thomas as a research assistant. The goal of the lab is to develop small molecule gelators that can be used to extract nitrogen and sulfur impurities from petroleum fuels. During her free time, Olivia likes to bike around the city.

**PROJECT TITLE:** The physical characterization of small molecule gelators

**MENTOR:** Dr. Marie Thomas, Department of Natural Science

**ABSTRACT: **Acid rain can be detrimental to animals, aquatic species, and plants. The culprit behind this phenomenon is the nitrogen and sulfur oxides released to the atmosphere due to the combustion of petroleum fuels. Fuels may be purified through the process of extraction with hybrid materials such as ion gels.

Ion gels have been studied and/or used in drug delivery systems, sensors, electrochemical devices, lubricants, environmental remediation, etc. They are formed by combining an ionic liquid (an organic salt with a melting point below 100 °C) with polymers, nanomaterials, or small molecule gelators (SMGs). The addition of these various substances can enhance the physical properties of ionic liquids. We have synthesized a series of possible SMGs based on the tertiary amine 1,4-diazobicylo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO). The physical properties of these quaternary ammonium salts such as melting points, and solubilities in organic solvents have been obtained. Furthermore, several of these DABCO compounds have been tested for their ability to gel acetone, ethylene glycol, and ionic liquids. The choice of organic solvents for testing was based on computational studies.
