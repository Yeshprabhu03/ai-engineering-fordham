**PROJECT TITLE:** Does the Native Eastern Gray Squirrel Predate on the Invasive Spotted Lanternfly?

**MENTOR:** Ellen van Wilgenburg, Department of Natural Sciences

**ABSTRACT: **Lycorma delicatula, the spotted lanternfly, is an invasive species that was first brought to the US in 2014, and spread to New York City in 2020. This study was designed to determine whether or not the native eastern gray squirrel, Sciurus carolinensis, is predating on the invasive spotted lanternfly. The research consisted of field observations with ethograms, dissections of squirrel poop samples, and a feeding experiment. The results indicate that there may not be a prevalence of squirrel predation of the spotted lanternfly; however, this study serves as a baseline to which future research can be compared.
