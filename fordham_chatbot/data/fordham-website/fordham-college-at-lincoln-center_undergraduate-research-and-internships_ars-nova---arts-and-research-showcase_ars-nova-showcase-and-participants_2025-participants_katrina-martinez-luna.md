**Title of Research:** A Study on Self-Determination, Sustainable Development, and Indigenous Cultural Preservation in Batanes, Philippines

**Mentor:** Goutam Gajula, Ph.D., Sociology and Anthropology

**Abstract:** The project’s key objective is to contribute to wider discourse on development among indigenous peoples through a case study of the province of Batanes, Philippines. Home to the indigenous Ivatan people, Batanes is a relatively successful case of human development. Based on information collected from one-on-one interviews with key figures in Ivatan society, this research explores how cultural preservation and self-determination have led to this success. It also identifies other contributing factors found in traditional Ivatan culture, such as community spirit and sharing practices. Furthermore, the paper highlights key dilemmas faced by indigenous communities, such as economic liberalization and the influence of urban culture. Other identified problems encompass the legislative system that facilitates Batanes’ self-rule. Government prescription often conflicts with local needs and already-established structures of power. Overall, the research paper analyzes indigenous development through a multidisciplinary lens wherein economics, anthropology, and political science are invaluable to a proper understanding of the phenomenon.
