# Senior Thesis and Capstone Project Grant

The goal of the FCLC Senior Thesis/Capstone Project Grant is to ensure that students can accomplish their research goals or carry out a meaningful final project, regardless of cost. This grant helps to defray expenses incurred by students completing a Senior Thesis Seminar/Capstone Seminar* project for their major.

The grant is awarded by the FCLC Dean’s Office in varying amounts, depending on need. The grant is awarded on a rolling basis, but the below guidelines must be adhered to.

## Guidelines and criteria:

- Applicants must be enrolled in a senior thesis/capstone course required for their Major.
- The funding request must be made only
*after*the student is enrolled in the senior thesis seminar/capstone course (the course must appear on the registration schedule) and has discussed an approved project with their thesis advisor. - All application items must be submitted (including a thesis advisor/faculty letter of support, and itemized amounts for each requested expense) in order to be considered for this grant.
- The application does not ask for receipts, but there is the expectation that all applicants will adhere to the honor codes of the University.
