# Summer Research Assistant Fellowship

The FCLC Summer Research Assistant Fellowship Program supports both faculty and students and furthers research opportunities at FCLC. The Fellowship awards grants to students to support research that advances faculty-led projects; in turn, faculty have the opportunity to work with a student on their research projects over the summer months.

The fellowship is open to rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors at FCLC. Typically, the student and faculty application processes open in the spring for the grant period in the summer. A time commitment of 150-200 hours for participating students is expected.

More details are provided by the FCLC Dean’s Office in early spring of each year.
