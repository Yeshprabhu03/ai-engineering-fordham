**it's super cool**. I also interned at Adweek: My interviewer and half the marketing team is from Fordham, and I worked closely with five or six Fordham alumni. **There are definitely a lot of big Ram fans out there**. ![Maroon close quotation mark](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/pdfs/jadu-pdfs/FCRH_close_quotation_mark.png)

**Your opportunities open up early.**

We don’t think you should have to face cutthroat competition or wait until you're a junior to have great internships. FCRH students start having these experiences as early as their first year. And with Manhattan a quick ride by train or campus van, there are limitless opportunities to do well and do good—the Fordham name opens doors for you in every field and sector.

**Inspiration, clarity, direction.**

One of the way students here find their path (or paths) is through our Core. It's not your typical set of requirements: The Core is a cohesive, four-year journey with your classmates and professors through big, complex ideas and it's also an opportunity to explore with focus and structure--a valuable experience whether you're certain of your major (or majors) or are still exploring.

**It was the most worthwhile thing I've ever done**, because at the end I had a better appreciation for how important it is to understand both sides-- not just look for things that support your position. **It’s about knowing as much as you can**. ![Maroon close quotation mark](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/pdfs/jadu-pdfs/FCRH_close_quotation_mark.png)

**Fordham connection. **Right after graduation, I was a New York City Urban Fellow, which I got through Fordham. Then I worked in the press office of the Manhattan District Attorney, and the deputy communications director was a Fordham alum. And now I work with two or three other Fordham alumni. So **I feel like everywhere I go, it’s like finding family**, really. ![Maroon close quotation mark](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/pdfs/jadu-pdfs/FCRH_close_quotation_mark.png)

**That sense of community and belonging you feel here? It stays with you**.


Fordham College at Rose Hill is home to people who are curious and collaborative by nature. There’s always someone ready to help you take an idea further and bring out the best in you. That doesn’t go away after you graduate. Rams stay connected because they bring out the best in each other.

**we bonded immediately**! Surgical teams can be somewhat hierarchical, but **the beauty of a Fordham education is its power to overcome all boundaries**. I'm proud to be a Ram. ![Maroon close quotation mark](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/pdfs/jadu-pdfs/FCRH_close_quotation_mark.png)

**Good vibes run in our Ramily.**

FCRH alums are grateful for how the experience broadly and humanely shaped their lives. They know that excellence means being more and doing more for the world. It's a good thing to have in common.
