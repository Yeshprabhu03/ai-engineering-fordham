# Information for Incoming First-Years at Rose Hill

All FCRH students complete a liberal arts core curriculum that is designed to develop critical thinking, clear expression, scientific understanding, an awareness of historical perspective and contemporary challenges, and an appreciation of religious, philosophical, and moral values.

We encourage you to consult our "[Essential Resources](/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/student-resources/academic-resources/)," either as a glimpse of what your Fordham education will look like, or for helpful guidance on your specific questions here and now.

Transfer students, please check out our [Transfer Orientation Guide](/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/academics/pre-professional-programs/transfer-advising/information-for-transfer-students/).

Incoming FCRH first-year students self-register using extensive guidance from their summer adviser. Together, advisers and students consider students' DegreeWorks course selection guidance, drawing from responses on the required First-Year Survey and online placement tests.

We offer a Blackboard (Bb) resource page to help students navigate the registration process and in-depth materials about course selection. Full details are found in the "Incoming Student Registration Tutorials (Fordham College at Rose Hill)" Bb course. Please be sure to check your Fordham email account daily and connect your email account to your smartphone.

Students who plan to participate in the Pre-Health Program (pre-medical, pre-dental, pre-veterinary, pre-optometry, pre-physical therapy, pre-physician assistant, etc.) should specify their interest in this program in the First-Year Registration Survey. Pre-Health Program participants will be given the appropriate Degree Works registration guidance, which includes majors-level biology and chemistry courses, as well as the Pre-Health Symposium.

Pre-health is not a major and students who are interested in pursuing this program are encouraged to major in the subject of their choice while completing pre-health studies.

Students participating in the Pre-Health Program are strongly encouraged to consider living in the Science Integrated Learning Community (SILC) inside Alumni Court South.
