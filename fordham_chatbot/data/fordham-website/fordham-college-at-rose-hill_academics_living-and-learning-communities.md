# Living and Learning Communities at FCRH

## Learning Inside and Outside of the Classroom

Whatever your residence hall, you'll have a scenic academic home at Fordham. And your education doesn't have to end after class each day. FCRH students can apply to live in Integrated Learning Communities, or ILCS—residence halls designed to help develop conscience, character, and intellect in the Jesuit tradition through special programming. Students who receive housing are guaranteed accommodations for four years.
