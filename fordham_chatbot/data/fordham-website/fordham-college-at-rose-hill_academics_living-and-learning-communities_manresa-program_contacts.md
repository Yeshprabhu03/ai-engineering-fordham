# Manresa Program Contacts

When you join Manresa, you craft a rigorous and vibrant education in concert with devoted staff from the FCRH and GSB Dean's Offices, Campus Ministry, and Residential Life as well as engaging and well-respected faculty members. We support you in your academic, spiritual, and social growth. You learn that succeeding at Fordham, and particularly in Manresa, requires you to collaborate with peers and mentors whom you know well and trust, and who, in turn, respect you. Our faculty and staff embody this collaboration.

We invite you to reach out to us with any questions you might have about the Program.
