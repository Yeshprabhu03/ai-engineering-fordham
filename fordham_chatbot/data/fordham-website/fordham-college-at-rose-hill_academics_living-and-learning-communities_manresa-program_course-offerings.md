**Professor Thomas J. Scirghi, S.J.**THEO 1010-R01, Tuesday & Friday 11:30am-12:45pm

Many writers have described their personal quest for the transcendent. Writers – both classical and popular, believers and atheists, some reverent, some vulgar – describe this quest as a matter of first losing, and then finding themselves. This seminar will explore the search of several of these writers through their autobiographies. Much of our discussion concerns contemporary authors, i.e., from the twentieth century to the present.
