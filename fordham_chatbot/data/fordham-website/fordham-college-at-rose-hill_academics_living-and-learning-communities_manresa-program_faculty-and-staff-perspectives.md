# Manresa Program Faculty and Staff Perspectives

In a dark cave in Manresa, Spain, Ignatius of Loyola was enlightened. Ignatius, "the pilgrim," would pray in the cave for hours each day. And then he experienced a vision- an encounter with God after which all creation acquired a new meaning, and the pilgrim found God in all things.

My great desire is for Manresa Scholars to experience *something* of what Ignatius of Loyola experienced during his less than a year sojourn in that small Catalan town: a totally transformative experience, the beginning of a new life, a turning point. I want to see the Manresa residential program become a staging point for their lives to be marked by depth of thinking and imagination (intellectual, affective), passionate living (virtuous, disciplined), and always being in love (committed, self-sacrificing).

I love spending time with my students and colleagues outside of the classroom. I enjoy so much how these opportunities are seamlessly woven into the Manresa curriculum. It’s such a fun, rewarding teaching experience. I also am so grateful for the genuine emphasis on service that is a core part of Manresa programming. To me, there has been no better way to get to know my students than in participating in service activities together.
