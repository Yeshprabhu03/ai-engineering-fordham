The Pre-Health Professions Program at FCRH assists students in all majors who are interested in pursuing a health-related career by providing them with focused academic and career advising, advice on gaining research, clinical, and volunteer experience, as well as specialized extracurricular and residential options. Fordham has a long history of preparing students for medical, dental, veterinary, and other health-professional careers. Our students have been accepted to many top osteopathic schools of medicine, as well as dentistry, optometry, podiatry, and veterinary medicine.
