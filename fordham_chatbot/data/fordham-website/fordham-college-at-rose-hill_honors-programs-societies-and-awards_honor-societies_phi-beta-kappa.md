# Phi Beta Kappa (Liberal Arts Society) at Rose Hill

## Liberal Arts Honor Society

Phi Beta Kappa is the oldest, largest, and most widely recognized academic honor society in America. Founded![Female faculty member pointing - SM](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/KGamble_041612_2630__SM.jpg)


Fordham University's chapter of Phi Beta Kappa (Tau of New York) was established in 1962. Each May, it installs new members from among the most academically distinguished upperclass students.


Phi Beta Kappa candidates must:

- Be a junior or senior who has completed at least four full semesters at Fordham College at Rose Hill.

- Have compiled outstanding academic records.

- Exhibit excellence in a broad liberal arts curriculum that includes English, history, philosophy or theology, mathematics, a foreign language, and the social sciences.

Students with outstanding grade point indexes are screened for membership. The society limits its ranks to those who have also exhibited a wide range of intellectual interests. Accordingly, selection is contingent upon the variety of the student's course work outside the major; evidence of intellectual maturity; and the quality of evaluative remarks written by professors.
