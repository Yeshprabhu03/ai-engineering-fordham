# Psi Chi (Psychology Society) at FCRH

## Psychology Honor Society

[Psi Chi](/student-life/student-organizations/rose-hill-student-organizations/), the International Honor Society in Psychology, was established on September 9, 1929 to encourage, stimulate, and maintain excellence in scholarship of members in all fields, particularly in psychology, and to advance the science of psychology.

Fordham's first Psi Chi Chapter, Lincoln Center Chapter #576, was established on December 9, 1983 by Dr. Harold Takooshian. Dr. Takooshian has long been devoted to Psi Chi, serving as Fordham's Psi Chi faculty advisor since 1983, and as Psi Chi's 1988-1989 national president.

Psi Chi accepts students:

- Who are enrolled in any psychology programs: graduate, undergraduate, or evening.

- Have completed a minimum of 12 credits in psychology.

- Have a overall grade point average of 3.320 or higher.

Psi Chi provides students with an opportunity to meet psychology students and professors outside of the classroom setting at both scholarly and entertaining activities. Events are often co-sponsored with Fordham's Psychology Clubs.

The society provides members with opportunities meet and collaborate with other psychology students on a national and international basis, and opens the door to friendships as well as research collaboration. Psi Chi members who attend the annual APA Convention, and other psychology conventions, enjoy events sponsored by Psi Chi, and relax at the Psi Chi Hospitality Suite.
