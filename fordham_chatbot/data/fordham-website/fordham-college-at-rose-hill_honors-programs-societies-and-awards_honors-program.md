## A Community of Scholars for Justice

The Honors Program at Fordham College at Rose Hill is a community of scholars for justice. Our students have a deep curiosity that drives them—to push themselves and each other to explore topics in depth, to cross boundaries and disciplines, and to use their knowledge to think creatively about real-world issues. In discussion-driven classes, students from all majors pursue an alternate core curriculum that focuses on three features of Jesuit education—community, scholarship, and the pursuit of justice—all on a beautiful campus with easy access to everything New York City has to offer.

"The Honors Program exposed me to a dynamic, transformative education that I couldn't have found anywhere else. And it’s also where I met my zaniest, most supportive, and closest friends at Fordham."

### Who Are Our Students?

The Honors Program recognizes and affirms the ethical and intellectual importance of diversity to a robust education. We therefore actively seek a cohort of students with varying identities and backgrounds who can learn from each other’s differing experiences, perspectives, commitments, and values.

### Curriculum

- An Honors core with fewer required classes to allow time for greater intellectual exploration
- A substantive engagement with the concerns of justice and diversity in every course across the curriculum
- A first-year investigation of foundational texts and topics primarily in Western intellectual and cultural traditions followed by focused study of specific subjects across diverse disciplines and cultures
- Two courses specifically devoted to the academic study of justice in American and global contexts
- A first-year course exploring the Bronx, the culturally rich borough we call home
- A course devoted to research methods and required research or scholarly engagement in every class starting in the sophomore year

Note: This curriculum is in effect for students entering in fall 2019 and beyond. Students that entered in fall 2018 or earlier follow a different curriculum.

### Classes

Seminar-style classes of 12–14 students that …

- foster sustained and spirited conversation
- provide an opportunity to sharpen speaking and writing skills
- are taught by distinguished professors who excel in their fields and in the classroom

### Community

Honors students become lifelong friends with a diverse group of individuals as intellectually curious as they are. There are many opportunities to build community as a Fordham student and as an Honors student in particular.

- Hang out in Alpha House, an Honors-only space open 24/7 for studying, late-night paper writing, and spending time with friends.
- Take advantage of a first-year, one-credit course exploring the Bronx, the culturally rich borough we call home, as well as co-curricular outings in Manhattan.
- Attend our formal and informal Honors gatherings and social events throughout the year.
- Pay it forward and give back alongside your Honors peers through community engagement and social justice work.
- Take on a leadership role within the Honors Program’s
