**First-Year Students**

There is no separate admission process for the Fordham College at Rose Hill Honors Program.

The Honors Program director and administrator, along with a committee of Honors faculty, work closely with the Office of Undergraduate Admission to select students who will be invited to join the program.

Prospective students are reviewed holistically based on their overall academic record, test scores, essays, and letters of recommendation. Invited students will be notified by the Office of Admission.

Due to size limitations, we are not able to extend Honors Program invitations to all qualified students. However, any interested student may contact us by emailing [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#640c0b0a0b161714160b03160c24020b16000c05094a010011).

**Upper-Level Students**

Occasionally, we are able to offer admission to the Honors Program after the first semester at Fordham, and at the beginning of sophomore year.

First-year students who have thrived at Fordham College at Rose Hill and wish to join the Honors Program should contact the program administrator for more information.
