**Honors Jubilee Reception**

The Honors Program hosts a special reception at Alpha House during every Jubilee Weekend at Fordham University. The reunion event celebrates the Honors graduates who have graduated in five- and ten-year intervals from Fordham.

**Honors Alumni Cocktail Reception**

Each year in early March, the Honors Program hosts an Alumni Cocktail Reception at the easily accessible Lincoln Center campus in Manhattan. This is a great opportunity for Honors grads to share drinks with fellow alumni, reconnect with friends and professors, meet current Honors students, and generally celebrate all things Honors.
