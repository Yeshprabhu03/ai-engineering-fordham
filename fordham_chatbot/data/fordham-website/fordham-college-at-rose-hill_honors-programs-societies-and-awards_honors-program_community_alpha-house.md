### The Heart of the Honors Program

Alpha House provides an on-campus home for every cohort. All Honors students receive 24/7 access to Alpha House. The upstairs seminar room doubles as a space for movie nights, open mic nights, and other Honors events. The basement lounge is a space for study sessions, student meetings, and just hanging out. It is equipped with computers and printers for Honors student use.

"Alpha House has been a really wonderful place to get to know people, to work together, to debate, to have fun. I really value the friendships that I've made in Alpha House—during impromptu movie screenings on a Friday night or philosophy paper writing sessions that go until 3 in the morning."

—Sarah Homer, Honors Alumna
