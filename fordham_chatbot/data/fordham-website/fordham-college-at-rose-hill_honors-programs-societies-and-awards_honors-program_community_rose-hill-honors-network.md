# Rose Hill Honors Network

## AJCU Programs Network

The FCRH Honors Program is an active member of the [Honors Programs Network](https://ajcunet.edu/honors-programs/) established by the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities. The Network holds an annual meeting, bringing together program directors and Honors students from Jesuit universities across the United States. Usually, 2-4 FCRH Honors students participate in the annual meeting and engage in discussions about best practices at Jesuit honors programs and collaboration among universities.

In 2025, the Program Director, Olena Nikolayenko, and three Honors students – Emma Reiter (FCRH ’28, Art History), Kate Stover (FCRH ’28, Political Science), and Kate Turnbull (FCRH ’27, Communication and Culture) – attended the 2025 annual meeting of the AJCU Honors Network at [Rockhurst University](https://www.rockhurst.edu/academics/honors-program) in Kansas City, MO. “Our students attend the event to connect with and learn from other Jesuit Honors Programs across the country,” said Hannah Teligades, the FCRH Honors Program administrator, in an interview with the [Fordham Ram](https://thefordhamram.com/news/fordham-students-attend-ajcu-honors-conference/).

As part of the Outreach and Recruitment committee, I have spent much of the semester thinking about ways in which we can engage with our future students.

The YouTube "Day in the Life" series that we are starting is only part of what I hope will be a much larger effort to make admitted students feel welcomed by and knowledgeable about the program. Attending the conference allowed me to better understand the mechanisms used by other programs to engage with their future students. Kate Stover (FCRH ’28, Political Science) I learned from the speakers what makes a good leader and how to be a better mentor for my peers and honors students younger than me. I also learned about the importance of helping my community and was given skills to make a change in my community. Kate Turnbull (FCRH ’27, Communications)

The 2026 meeting will be held at [Fairfield University](https://www.fairfield.edu/academics/experiential-learning/honors-program/) in Connecticut.
