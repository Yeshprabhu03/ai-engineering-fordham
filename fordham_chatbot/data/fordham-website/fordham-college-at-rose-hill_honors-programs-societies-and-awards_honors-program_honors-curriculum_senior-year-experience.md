## Honors Curriculum Capstone: The Senior Thesis

The capstone of the Honors curriculum is the senior thesis, an extended research project carried out under the guidance of a faculty member in the student’s chosen major field. The thesis allows students to apply the advanced writing and analytical skills they have honed throughout their Honors experience to topics they are most passionate about. Graduate and professional schools, as well as prospective employers, recognize the thesis as a clear indication of a student's ability to do independent work at an advanced level.

### Senior Thesis Seminar

Throughout their senior year, students meet with their classmates and the director of the program in the Honors Senior Thesis Seminar.

The first semester of the Senior Thesis Seminar is focused on developing an intellectual portfolio of a student’s cumulative career in Honors and at FCRH. In the second semester, students learn to create three-minute TED-talk-style presentations about their theses. Students then present their three-minute thesis talks to faculty, family, and friends on the day of Encaenia, Fordham College at Rose Hill’s Honors graduation ceremony.
