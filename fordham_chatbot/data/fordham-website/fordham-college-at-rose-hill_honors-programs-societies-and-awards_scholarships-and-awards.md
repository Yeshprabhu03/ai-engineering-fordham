Fordham College at Rose Hill is dedicated to offering our students many opportunities to excel. The College strongly encourages all students to compete for [scholarships](/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/honors-programs-societies-and-awards/scholarships-and-awards/scholarships/), fellowships, and [awards](/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/honors-programs-societies-and-awards/scholarships-and-awards/awards/). Not only do such applications offer the prospect of financial support for undergraduate and [graduate studies](/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/academics/pre-professional-programs/graduate-school-advising/), but the process of applying for these awards also yields important long-term benefits.

Students who achieve exceptional academic success are granted distinction at graduation ceremonies and the privilege of wearing honors regalia at [Commencement](/commencement/).
