# Study Abroad & Travel Scholarships

Fordham College at Rose Hill offers several scholarships to help defray the costs of study abroad and international travel especially during the summer months in faculty-led programs. Please see below for the different options to select from; students may apply to only one of these options within an academic year. **Please note that these options are for FCRH students only and students may only apply for one award within the academic year.** We are unable to review applications from students outside of FCRH and from students who apply for one than one grant.

The deadline for applications is January 30, 2026. For students participating in spring study tours, the deadline is January 16, 2026. Funding is limited and all applicants will be notified of the results by the end of February.
