# Academic Wellbeing

## Learn, Laugh and Love!

We are here for you to support your academic wellbeing in holistic ways. You fill our campus with laughter and love and we are dedicated to giving you the same experience. Below we are so happy to share links to our campus partners as well as resources we have developed for you.

## Academic Resources & Support

-
The FCRH Dean's Office offers proactive academic coaching services to students who would like to improve their organizational skills and course performance. Students may also be referred for these services when the Dean's Office is alerted by an instructor to a student's repeated class absences or poor academic performance. We help students:

-
Organize a calendar/academic planner

-
Practice workable and efficient study and reading strategies

- Bolster executive functioning skills and academic motivation
-
Utilize the appropriate University/College resources to assist them with personal, psychological and financial issues

-
Understand their progress in a course in a complete and constructive way

-
Avoid further class absences


The Dean's Office strongly encourages students of all class years and majors who are experiencing academic difficulty, or are interested in strategies to bolster their academic skills to discuss this with their advisor or class dean. They will offer guidance or refer you for additional assistance from one of our academic coaching team members.
