# Finding a Mentor for Undergraduate Research

![Mentorship in Physics](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/Physics_Mentorship___MD.jpg)

Professor Aubin and his mentee William Charles (Class of 2018)

## We offer the following suggestions for finding a mentor at FCRH.

- Visit the associate chair of the department in which you are interested in doing research—they can often make great faculty referrals.
- Talk to one of your professors after class about either their or their colleagues’ research. Students strongly encourage this!
- Review department webpages; many of these describe faculty research interests. Our faculty loves talking about their research, so they will welcome you inquiring!
- Note that only tenured or tenure-track faculty members can mentor undergraduate students during the academic year, so keep that in mind as you discuss projects with faculty. Non-tenure line faculty may mentor over the summer.
- Below are some faculty who have advertised positions they have, or that they are interested in being contacted. Reach out to them!

**Over 100 faculty members mentored students in undergraduate research last year alone.**

Routine diurnal photoreceptor outer segment renewal is a fundamental homeostatic process in the vertebrate retina. The research in the Finnemann laboratory focuses on molecules and pathways that mediate signaling between photoreceptors and neighboring retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. The resulting cellular cross-talk ensures timely exposure of the “eat me” signal phosphatidylserine at spent photoreceptor outer segment tips followed by their uptake and degradation by the RPE. Additional current work explores RPE intrinsic anti-inflammatory signaling downstream of RPE phagocytic receptors, which is essential to protect the neural retina from distress and, eventually, degeneration." - Time commitment: flexible, but 8 hours per week minimum
- Deadline: recruitment each spring depending on # of graduating seniors
- Other relevant information: Should have genetics lab or equivalent molecular lab experience; cell biology course preferred but not required

2-3 positions available - Project description: Manifest (https://manifest.supplystudies.com) is an narrative toolkit for visualizing, analyzing, and documenting supply chains, production lines, and trade networks. While of signiﬁcant social and environmental importance, global supply chains are both complex and opaque. Communicating the impacts of these networks—in journalism, scholarship, and advocacy—is challenging. In response, Manifest recontextualizes approaches from supply chain management systems to provide a platform that produces and disseminates the critical accounts of global logistical operation necessary for understanding the impact of these structures, particularly with regard to media technologies and communication systems.
