Celine Fitzgerald earned a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from Fordham University in Bronx, New York in 2009. Since finance was not her wheelhouse, she traveled to Milan, Italy [at the recommendation of Dean Aksoy] to attend SDA Bocconi and earn her Master's in Fashion, Experience, and Design Management in 2011. After three years of analytical work, customer service, and trunk show planning in NYC, she moved home to Chicago. In 2017, she made one of the best decisions of her life, per her dad’s request, to enroll at Loyola University Chicago to earn an MBA. During the internship at Loyola’s Family Business Center, she met families, listened to generational stories, and sat in on family business seminars. It was not until this moment that she appreciated succession planning, next-gen education, estate planning or governance. She and her dad launched Webb & O’Neill Capital, a Single Family Office, in 2019 to manage the family’s finances, operating business activities, and philanthropy.

After personal lived experience, she now has the honor of coaching and mentoring RisingGen family members at In Three Generations. She and her growing family are located in Hinsdale, IL.
