# Dean's Welcome

![Dean Aksoy](/media/home/schools/gabelli-school-of-business/Dean_Aksoy_Headshot.jpg)

I welcome you to a school where business leaders are made.

A Fordham business education brings together features that no other school, anywhere in the world, can replicate:

- Programs that develop the skills needed at the very top: business fundamentals, plus the creative thinking, problem-solving, writing, and public speaking skills that distinguish C-suite executives
- Two New York City campuses, positioning students in the world capital of commerce
- A fully global curriculum, including study abroad options at every level
- An uncommonly loyal network of 40,000 Fordham business alumni

What distinguishes Fordham, as the only Jesuit business school in New York City, is our commitment to “leadership with purpose”: conducting business that generates profit while benefiting other people. Students emerge from our programs understanding exactly how to go above and beyond to advance their own careers, their industry of choice, and society as a whole.

We look forward to welcoming the next class of students who will change the landscape.
