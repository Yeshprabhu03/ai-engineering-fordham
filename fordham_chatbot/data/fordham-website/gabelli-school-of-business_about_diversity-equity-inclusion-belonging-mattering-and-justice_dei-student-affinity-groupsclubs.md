# DEI Student Affinity Groups/Clubs

The Gabelli School of Business maintains an academic and social climate that all student organizations can thrive in. Our diverse student organizations function like employee resource groups because the GSB works with these organizations directly to support their individual missions. Our student clubs are open to all students, including undergraduate and graduate students.
