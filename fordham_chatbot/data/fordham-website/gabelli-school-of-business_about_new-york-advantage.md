# New York Advantage

If you want to shape world commerce, go to business school in the center of world commerce.

At Fordham, you will have access year-round to internships that students in Boston, St. Louis, or Washington, D.C., can only hope to have during the summer.

Your class might visit the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the New York Stock Exchange, or the United Nations.

You may connect with executives at companies such as Tiffany & Co., Mashable, or BBDO.

Your Integrated Marketing Communications course might be taught by a former EVP at global advertising powerhouse McCann Erickson.

You can test out your idea for a “local” mobile app on one of the world’s largest, most diverse, and most fascinating populations, 9 million strong.
