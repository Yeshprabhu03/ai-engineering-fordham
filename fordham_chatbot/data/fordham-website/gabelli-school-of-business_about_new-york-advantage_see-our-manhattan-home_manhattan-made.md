# Manhattan-Made

Manhattan’s power to change lives, win hearts, and set the stage for greatness has been proven over the course of four centuries.

Whether you are a Gabelli School student at Rose Hill or Lincoln Center, you will make Manhattan your own—and in your own way.

## Let’s explore.

Our starting point is [Lincoln Center](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/undergraduate-programs/which-campus/lincoln-center/). Practically next door is the Time Warner Center, home to Jazz at Lincoln Center and CNN Studios. Five blocks on, you’ll find the offices of Accenture, AllianceBernstein, and Linklaters all in one building.

Nearby on your right is the headquarters of publishing house Scholastic; to your left is 30 Rockefeller Center. A couple of more blocks east is Park Avenue, home to American Express, JPMorgan Chase, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, and dozens of other financial services firms.

## Onward!

Park Avenue leads you directly into Grand Central Terminal. After you pass through its grand hall and continue south, you can spy the United Nations and, then, the towers surrounding Madison Square Park; one houses Credit Suisse, another New York Life.

Nearly every block from here to Battery Park offers you a door to a business you know: Google, Food Network, Deutsche Bank, the New York Stock Exchange, Moody’s.

Any of these companies could be your first job after graduation.

## Where to Next? Your Career.

The path begins with your passion. You will propel yourself forward with your hard work at the Gabelli School, and the network of connections you will form along the way. This is how—and where—a career is forged.
