## At the heart of business in New York City

Executive education at the Gabelli School of Business is at the heart of business in New York City. We empower executives to conduct business in a way that transforms society, advancing their organizations while improving the lives of others.

The Gabelli School brings together an extraordinary business faculty and Jesuit traditions with a solutions-focused orientation that enables executives to make immediate change, and that cultivates “leadership with purpose.”

Fordham’s executive-education team will work with you to develop the best solution for your organization, ensuring results with impact. Options include [customized programs for small groups, large groups, or individuals](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/executive-education/custom-programs/)—at your location or on our campus.

[Open-enrollment executive programs](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/executive-education/open-enrollment/) provide an additional range of opportunities for Fordham alumni and business professionals from New York City and beyond. These draw on the strengths of our faculty and are offered in two- to five-day formats throughout the year.
