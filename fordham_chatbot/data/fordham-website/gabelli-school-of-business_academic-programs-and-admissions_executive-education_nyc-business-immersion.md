The Gabelli School of Business is your “gateway” to business in New York City.

Gateway Programs are customized New York City immersions for university groups from other cities and countries. We collaborate with you to design an introduction to our city’s commerce, culture, and history—one week or more, depending on your needs.

Then, you and your students join us in midtown for an unforgettable experience.

**Custom Gateway Programs offer:**

- University-based lectures taught by Fordham business faculty
- On-site visits to top international companies
- A specialized focus that matches your group’s interest: finance, technology, advertising and marketing, entertainment and media, accounting, sports business—you choose
- Networking opportunities
