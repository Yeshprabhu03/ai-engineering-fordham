**Environmental, social, and governance** (ESG) covers a broad range of ever-increasingly important business issues. ESG concerns are becoming part of mainstream business discussions, and they require that companies consider more than just profit but create value for all stakeholders, including suppliers, customers, employees, and society.

Fordham University’s Responsible Business Coalition has developed an ESG curriculum that is eligible for CPE credit to help professionals navigate the ESG landscape.

ESG Boot Camp

**Date: September 22nd, 2023, from 10 a.m. - 2:30 p.m.**

ESG is about risk, mitigation, and opportunity. Fordham’s ESG Boot Camp helps students understand the mix of extra-financial ESG risks and opportunities companies face, including climate change, pollution and waste, human capital, product liability, corruption, business ethics, and cyber threats. Through interactive instruction, discussion, and hands-on exercises, this half-day boot camp will help participants understand ESG's essential concepts and issues, including:

- The genesis and future of ESG
- ESG market drivers and stakeholders, including consumers, policy setters, investors, academia, and social media
- Integrating sustainability-related values, goals, and metrics into business strategies
- The ESG reporting landscape, including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), TCFD/CDSB, and IIRC/<IR> Frameworks

The ESG Boot Camp is designed for board members, executives, and professionals interested in understanding the fundamental concepts of ESG in a quick-moving, exciting format. The course is offered in a virtual format and will be taught by Timothy P. Hedley, Ph.D., an executive-in-residence at the Gabelli School of Business at Fordham University.

When considering ESG, the “G” is often overlooked amid considerations over climate threats and other environmental or social risks. However, some of the most significant corporate environmental and societal failures have roots in poor governance structures and integrity breakdowns. This two-hour session will introduce participants to the notion that good governance is the foundation of stakeholder prosperity. Through interactive instruction, group discussion, and a hands-on exercise, participants will…

- Explore how the “G” component of ESG ultimately leads to better financial returns and investor confidence
- Understand such governance concepts as structure, policies, procedures and controls, transparency, disclosure, auditing, and monitoring
- Discover salient governance topics, such as activist investors, cyber threats, corporate culture, diversity and inclusion
- Appreciate business codes of conduct and ethics
- Screen for governance practices

Designed for board members, executives, and professionals, this course will help participants understand the importance of “G” in ESG. Attendees should expect a quick-moving and interactive session offered on-premises and in virtual formats.
