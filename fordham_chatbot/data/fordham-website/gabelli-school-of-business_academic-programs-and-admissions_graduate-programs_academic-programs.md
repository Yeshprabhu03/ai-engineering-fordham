No matter what your career goal, Fordham has a business program tailored to match it.

How do we make this possible?

Drawing on the depth of expertise of our 127 full-time business faculty members and the breadth and flexibility of myriad graduate business courses, we are able to offer three variants of the MBA program—a [full-time cohort M.B.A](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/graduate-programs/academic-programs/full-time-mba/)., [Professional M.B.A](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/graduate-programs/academic-programs/professional-mba/). (including part-time), and [Executive M.B.A](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/graduate-programs/academic-programs/executive-mba/).—along with 13 specialized Master of Science programs developed for the business niches that seek today’s student talent. **Students who earn a degree in select U.S. government-designated STEM programs may be eligible to apply for a 24-month STEM OPT extension.**
