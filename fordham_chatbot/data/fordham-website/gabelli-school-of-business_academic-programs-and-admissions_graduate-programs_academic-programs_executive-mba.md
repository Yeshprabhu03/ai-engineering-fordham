**Executive MBA students write their own ticket abroad. Literally.**Each 22-month Executive MBA experience concludes with an international capstone trip, the culmination of an in-depth, consulting-style business project. The students in the Executive MBA cohort collaborate to choose the country they'll focus on, and the business problem their consulting work will solve.

Then, once their consulting work is done, they get on a plane. In addition to presenting their project on-site, they benefit from cultural events and lectures on how to do business within their country of choice.
