# Military to M.B.A.

Transition your Service to the Business World

As a member of the U.S. Armed Forces, you have lived the ideal of “being men and women for others.”

We at Fordham can relate.

Three concepts rest at the heart of Jesuit education: *cura personalis, *developing the complete individual; *magis,* the idea of constantly striving for greater excellence; and *homines pro aliis,* being men and women for others.

Each of those is inextricable from the U.S. military ethos—and it explains why so many former personnel find a home in our MBA community.

“Based on cost and opportunity, Fordham is one of the best kept secrets out there for transitioning service members. Period.” – Chris Maloney (MBA ‘15), USMC Veteran


Where To? We’ll Help You Get There

The Gabelli School caters to the needs of servicemen and women who want to transition their service of others to the business world.

We were ranked No. 21 nationwide in the 2016 *Military Times* “Best for Vets” list of business schools.

With a Fordham MBA, You Can

Several of our faculty are veterans, and the Gabelli School enjoys strong relationships within the military community.

Ret. General Peter Pace, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has been an Executive in Residence at the Gabelli School since 2012. He joins us on campus several times a year to lead conversations with students about leadership and ethics.

MBA students are part of an active graduate-level organization called Business Student Veterans (B-VETS).

The Yellow Ribbon Program

Fordham University is a proud member of the Yellow Ribbon Program, pledging to make it as easy as possible for veterans to receive a Fordham education.

Fordham MBA veteran-students, assisted by the GI Bill and the [Yellow Ribbon Program](https://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/yellow_ribbon.asp), receive a housing stipend of roughly $3,500 per month as a full-time student (9 credits or more per term) and, most importantly, a world-class MBA education in the heart of Manhattan, completely debt-free.


During the 2008-2009 academic year, Fordham became one of the first universities in the country to commit to full participation in the federal government’s Yellow Ribbon Program. The Fordham veteran community has grown significantly since then—today, more than 400 veterans are enrolled—and the university is currently ranked #21 in *Military Times*’ national “Best for Vets” list.

We continue to affirm our Yellow Ribbon commitment to cover ALL tuition and fees for post-September 11 veterans and their dependents. The guarantee is applicable to any of the university’s nine schools to which you are admitted.
