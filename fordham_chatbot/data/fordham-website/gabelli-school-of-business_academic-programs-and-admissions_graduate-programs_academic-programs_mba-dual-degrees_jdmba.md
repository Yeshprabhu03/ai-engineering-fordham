# J.D./M.B.A.

In partnership with [Fordham Law School](/school-of-law/), the Gabelli School of Business offers an exciting combined program of graduate study in law and business administration.

## How Do You Benefit?

Eligible for the dual J.D./M.B.A. program are First-Year Law students as well as Full-time M.B.A. students; allowing participants to complete both degrees in as little as 4 years.

## When to Apply?

Due to the required four-week pre-term Gabelli Launch (beginning the last week of July each year), only entering or First-year Law School students (1L) are eligible to apply for the J.D./M.B.A.*Please note: any Summer legal internships must be completed prior to the pre-term Gabelli Launch. *

Students must apply and be admitted to the School of Law and School of Business separately.
