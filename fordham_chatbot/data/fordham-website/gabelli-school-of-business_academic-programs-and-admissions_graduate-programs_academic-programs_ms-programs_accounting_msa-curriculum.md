# M.S.A. Curriculum

**The technical skills you need. The experience employers want.**

These days, the right technical skills and certifications are just the minimum. Employers seek candidates who also have proven their ability to apply accounting knowledge to real-world situations.

For that reason, the Gabelli School Master of Science in Accounting (M.S.A.) curriculum features interactive learning experiences, requiring students to perform in circumstances that mimic current working conditions. Communication, presentation, and critical-thinking skills receive special emphasis, while internships ensure that students graduate with the experience that top-tier firms are looking for.
