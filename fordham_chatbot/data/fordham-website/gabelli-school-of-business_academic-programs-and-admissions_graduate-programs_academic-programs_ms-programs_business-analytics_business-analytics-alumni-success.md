### Zahyra Ceballos, GABELLI ’23

**Data Analyst, LexisNexis**

Zahyra Ceballos didn’t take a typical path to a career in data analytics. She studied international relations as an undergraduate and worked as a legal analyst at a law firm. Despite her non-technical background, she always had been fascinated by the power of data and its potential to drive innovation and growth. This led her to enroll in the Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) program at Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business. Today, she is a data analyst for LexisNexis, a leading provider of legal, regulatory, and business information solutions.

Ceballos was impressed by the Gabelli School's reputation for producing top-notch business leaders with a strong foundation in data analytics. “I felt that the program's rigorous curriculum and hands-on approach to learning aligned well with my career goals and desire to gain practical skills in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization,” she noted.

Hands-on explorations in machine learning were a highlight of Ceballos’ Gabelli School experience. “Engaging in machine learning projects allowed me to apply theoretical concepts to real-world business problems,” she asserted.

Ceballos also points to skills and knowledge she acquired in the Web Analytics, Big Data, and Database Management courses as being important assets in her daily work. “Web Analytics taught me how to use data to optimize website performance and user experience, which has been crucial in my role as a data analyst,” she noted. “Big Data and Database Management, on the other hand, gave me a deep understanding of data processing, storage, and retrieval, which are essential for any data analyst working with large datasets.”

The Gabelli School’s networking events enabled Ceballos to connect with industry experts and learn about emerging trends in data analytics. “Learning from industry experts who shared their insights and experiences was invaluable,” she commented.

Ceballos encourages MSBA students to embrace the networking and experiential learning opportunities that the program provides. “Stay curious and open to learning new skills and technologies, as the data analytics field is constantly evolving,” she concluded.

### Yuqi Chen, GABELLI ’23

**Senior Data Scientist, Omnicom Beauty Co-Lab**

Yuqi Chen’s professional journey has taken her from finance to strategic consulting, where she applies analytical skills to enhance business strategies and financial performance. Chen currently serves as a senior data scientist at Omnicom Media Group, specializing in data transformation and machine learning to drive marketing insights in the beauty industry. She works in Omnicom’s Beauty Co-Lab, a bespoke unit that services L’Oréal USA.

Chen, who holds a bachelor’s degree in economics from NYU and a Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) from Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business, credited her experiences at the Gabelli School with being instrumental in shaping her professional path.

“Courses like Database Management, Data Mining, and Web Analytics have profoundly impacted my career,” she said. “The practical skills I acquired through the MSBA program have been vital. The hands-on training in SQL and machine learning has enabled me to tackle complex data challenges effectively, significantly contributing to my role as a data scientist.”

In addition to developing SQL and machine learning competencies, which are essential for data-driven decision making and predictive analytics, she graduated equipped with Selenium and Beautiful Soup skills that enhanced her ability to gather and analyze web data for strategic insights.

Chen believes she has benefited from having access to the Gabelli School’s extensive network of professionals and alumni. “This network has been pivotal in providing career insights and opportunities,” she stated.

Chen would advise MSBA students to actively engage in networking and take every opportunity to apply learned skills to real-world scenarios from Day 1. “The hands-on experience you gain will be invaluable in cementing your knowledge and enhancing your practical skills, making you a more effective and innovative professional.”

### Yang Gao, GABELLI ’19

**Ph.D. Student, Indiana University**

Yang Gao is a second-year Ph.D. student at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business. As a research associate in Kelley’s Data Science and AI Lab, she designs novel algorithms and artifacts to solve problems in business and society. Her research primarily focuses on leveraging reinforcement learning and adversarial machine learning algorithms in cybersecurity. And it all began at Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business.

Gao, who was a management major as an undergraduate, discovered her passion for research while pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) at the Gabelli School. “The MSBA program sparked my interest in research. Before joining the program, I had no plans to engage in research or to consider earning a Ph.D.,” she admitted.

The Web Analytics course was particularly formative for Gao. She learned a lot about Python programming and social network analytics, and in her second year, became a teaching assistant for the course. “I created teaching materials for data crawling lab sessions and even got teaching opportunities,” she said. “Without this course and the research opportunities my professor gave me, I wouldn't be working toward my Ph.D. today.”

The MSBA program offered Gao many chances to work on research and practical projects outside of class. She served as a research associate with Professor Yilu Zhou, applying web scraping and machine learning skills and publishing her first paper at an academic conference. Gao also took part in a web analytics project for the United Nations and participated in competitions during which she had the opportunity to present her work to professionals. “The faculty was very supportive, helping us join these projects and guiding us throughout,” she noted.

Gao says that she wasn't the only one inspired to pursue research. “Some of my classmates went on to become quantitative researchers at financial firms or machine learning researchers in academic labs after graduation.”

### Haodan (Helen) Tian, GABELLI ’21

**Senior Data Analyst, Initiative**

After earning a master’s degree in marketing at Johns Hopkins University, Haodan (Helen) Tian decided she wanted to focus on business analytics. The Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) program at Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business—with its location in the heart of New York City and industry-relevant curriculum—was a perfect fit.

After completing her MSBA at the Gabelli School in 2021, Tian landed a position as a growth marketing analyst at Chefman. In January 2022, she moved to Initiative, a top global media agency, where she currently serves as a senior data analyst.

Tian feels that the courses she took at the Gabelli School have proven to be extremely valuable in her daily work. “These courses provided me with hands-on experience in using Python and SQL, which are closely related to the tasks I perform in my role,” she asserted. “By mastering these tools and understanding their underlying logic, I have significantly improved my work efficiency and enhanced my personal competitiveness in the workplace.”

Tian has utilized Python to build an automation workflow that collects data from multiple channels and cleans and transforms it, streamlining her team's processes and allowing them to analyze data more quickly and accurately, ultimately improving their decision-making abilities.

She also took advantage of the Gabelli School’s career services offerings. “The Student Success Center actively collaborates with enterprises to facilitate student internships and job opportunities, providing valuable resources to students as they begin their careers,” she said. During her time at the Gabelli School, Tian interned at KALO, Inc. and NovuGens, LLC, gaining resume-building, real-world experience in data analytics and business analysis.

Between the access to top companies and the opportunities to work and do research on campus, MSBA students have ample opportunities to apply theoretical knowledge to practical situations, which Tian sees as a major advantage. “The resources and vision of the MSBA program are noteworthy,” she asserts. “The academic quality and reputation of a program are paramount, and this program excels in both aspects.”
