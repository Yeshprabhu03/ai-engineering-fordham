### Eric Borun, GABELLI ’16

**Hyperion Analyst, Aramark**

Eric Borun is a senior Hyperion analyst at Aramark’s Philadelphia headquarters. He brings 12 years of systems design, analysis, and development experience to his current role. Borun has worked across the retail and consumer goods industry as well as in consulting services, holding positions at companies such as Five Below, J.Crew, Intelink, and Deloitte. Over the last six years, he has developed a particular expertise in Oracle’s EPM Cloud financial platform.

Borun, who earned a Master of Science in Information Technology (MSIT) from Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business, believes that his graduate studies played a key role in his career success. “The MSIT program offered the perfect opportunity to deepen my knowledge and technical skills in systems design and analysis, with some cross-learning in analytics blended in,” he asserted. “It gave me the tools to develop a more serious and well-grounded career working with corporate-class technologies upon graduation.”

Borun highlighted that the Gabelli School’s Lincoln Center campus is “incredibly located,” and pointed to its situation in one of the world’s largest hubs of business, finance, trade, and commerce. “This location offers a unique opportunity to be ‘close to the action,’ and provides the potential for networking and other such professional activities that are invaluable at the master’s level.”

While the objective advantages of earning a Fordham degree were clear to Borun, the decision to enroll at the University also resonated for him on a more personal level. He has a lifelong connection to Fordham through his family. “My father was a respected professor at the Gabelli School for over 40 years, and my mother earned an M.B.A. from Fordham in the 1980s. She enjoyed a successful career in banking until I came along,” he joked. “So, Fordham was always a university of considerable interest for me.”

### Yanyan “Dora” Deng, GABELLI ’20

**Financial Data Analyst, Cerebral Artery**

Yanyan “Dora” Deng loves to turn raw data into actionable insights. “I have a passion for telling stories with data,” she explained. She currently serves as a financial data analyst at Cerebral Artery, and previously focused on supply chain management as a data analyst at Sieman Healthineers.

Deng holds a Master of Science in Information Technology (MSIT) from Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business. As a graduate student, she took full advantage of the leadership opportunities at the Gabelli School. “I was impressed by the leadership activities we were able to participate in,” she stated. “They not only allowed me to enhance my understanding of myself and others, but also played a pivotal role in helping me to adapt quickly, strengthening my skills, and enabling me to successfully lead IT course projects, including Mindstorm innovation projects and the Deloitte sports event-forecasting competition.”

During the March Data Crunch Madness Competition, an annual collaboration between Deloitte and the Gabelli School, she was able to demonstrate her machine learning and analytical skills to a panel of judges comprised of industry professionals.

Deng also served as a teaching assistant for courses in data analysis and business analysis, leading hands-on projects and workshops. She conducted SQL workshops for more than 100 students; supervised professional Python installation; collected, aggregated, and analyzed Instagram data on Google Cloud using Pandas; and built automated visualization dashboards to track fashion trends. Deng also developed and explored mobile apps in Android Studio and Flutter with Java and Kotlin, guiding information technology and business analysis students in how to operate a customized mobile app to manage customer relations and leads. In addition, she gained real-world experience through an internship as a data science research assistant at NYU Langone’s Fenyo Lab.

Wherever Deng’s career path leads, she is ready: “Just like the adventurous Dora, I love to explore challenging things.”

### Leron Garriques, GABELLI ’21

**Finance Transformation Consultant, Accenture**

When Leron Garriques enrolled in the Master of Science in Information Technology (MSIT) program at Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business, he knew it would be a life-changing experience. “From the moment I stepped onto the campus, I knew I was embarking on a journey that would profoundly shape my future,” he asserted.

Garriques’ first impression held true. Today, he is a finance transformation consultant at Accenture, specializing in platform transformation and enterprise architecture to modernize financial software for a wide range of clients. He believes that his time at the Gabelli School was instrumental in positioning him to build a successful and fulfilling career.

“The Gabelli School’s MSIT program was perfect for me because it allowed me to expand my technical skills and knowledge in subjects that would serve me well in consulting,” he avowed. “Classes in artificial intelligence, project management, blockchain development, data science, and many others proved invaluable for my career path.”

Garriques noted that the MSIT program prepared him for success not only by enhancing his skills but also by expanding his network. “While the program was rigorous academically, it was equally rewarding socially, because it allowed me to develop real connections with extremely talented people beyond the classroom who will have a lasting impact on my career,” he explained.

Outside of work, Garriques is a DAO contributor for multiple Web3 projects, including Indexed DeFi products, blockchain data analytics, and smart contract security auditing. He also volunteers with iMentor, an organization that matches mentors with students from New York City high schools. “It's one of the most rewarding things I've ever done, as I can help shape the future of amazing young scholars,” he said. “From helping them prepare for the SAT to navigating the college application process, I have the opportunity to give back and support the next generation.”
