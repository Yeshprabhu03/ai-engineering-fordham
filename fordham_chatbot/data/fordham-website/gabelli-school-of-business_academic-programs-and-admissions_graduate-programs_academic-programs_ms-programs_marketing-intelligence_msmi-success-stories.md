**M.S.M.I. ’20**

**Memorable Quote:** “I always believed marketing to be an influential tool and catalyst for driving societal changes and making the world a better place to live in.”

**Undergraduate Degree:** Management Studies with a specialization in Marketing

**Current Career:** Site Lead-Pathways Operations Manager at Amazon

**About Me: **After high school, I earned my bachelor's degree in Management Studies with a specialization in Marketing. My interest and passion for marketing led me to further pursue Post Graduate Diploma in Management with Marketing as my specialization at the Institute of Technology and Management in Mumbai, India. There, I realized the power of combining technology with market research. In this world of infinite information, the union of big data and traditional market research can help yield more meaningful insight, which made me a meaningful asset to help businesses in their success.

*What attracted you to the M.S.M.I. program at Fordham?*

After graduating from my post graduate M.B.A. program, I started working for Lumiere Business Solutions, a market research agency, where I spent three years learning about qualitative research. I have managed accounts such as L'Oréal, HUL, and Aditya Birla. However, during my time with Lumiere, I realized that the marketing landscape is evolving and becoming more technology focused. It was then I felt the urge to move forward and transcend to new horizons. My desire to equip myself with this knowledge brought me to Fordham.

*What was the biggest advantage you gained from the program?*

Fordham helped me garner technical knowledge with courses like Data-Driven Marketing, Marketing Analytics, Marketing with Big Data, Digital Marketing Analytics, and Reveal Consumer Insights.

Acquiring these skills was a great advantage I gained from the MSMI program because most companies seek prospects with data analytics skills. Fordham provided me with various resources and skilled faculty members to help me develop my digital acumen. It helped me not only choose but also qualify for a career in the tech industry.

*How did your classes in the M.S.M.I. program advance your career?*

I was hired as a Pathways Operations Manager at Amazon. I became a site lead at a UNJ1 fulfillment center within four months of joining Amazon.

Though the program is 3 semesters, I was granted many opportunities during my time as a student. I had the opportunity to work as a graduate assistant with a professor in the program. Even during COVID, I managed to get an internship in a biotech company via Life-Sci and finally a full-time offer, all thanks to Fordham.

*What was your favorite course, and why? *

All courses that were data-focused helped me gain true insights on understanding and interpreting data. Market Research was my favorite course because it allowed me to apply the skills I was acquiring in the program and view the market from multiple perspectives!

**M.S.M.I. ‘20**

**Memorable Quote:** “The MSMI program enhanced my ability to explain and predict how consumers behave in the marketplace and to use the analytical skills learned in the program to drive the best performance on our campaign.”

**Undergraduate Degree:** Marketing

**Current Career:** Asst. Media Manager at GAP

**About Me:** During my time at Fordham University Gabelli School of Business as an undergrad, I was a decorated middle-distance runner and member of the D1 track and field team. Being active and involved with sports has always been a passion of mine, and I especially love the outdoors in all seasons. Hanging with my friends and family, experiencing art, theater, new restaurants, and concerts is what I do most weekends!

*What attracted you to the M.S.M.I. program at Fordham?*

As a Fordham undergrad, Gabelli always highlighted the importance of merging class learnings to real-word applications. I was confident that the MSMI program would continue to heighten this experiential learning emphasis. Our courses were tactical and relevantly designed to be applied within the industry.

Additionally, Fordham’s emphasis on investing in a holistic education was key for me. I love Fordham! My undergrad experience was so far beyond all my expectations and dreams that I wanted to continue being a Ram – and the Lincoln Center location was a major plus!

*What was the biggest advantage you gained from the program?*

Because marketing is very digitally driven now, the M.S.M.I. program’s combination of analytical marketing and traditional strategic marketing was instrumental in getting me where I am in my career.

From this program, I can explain consumer behavior in the marketplace retroactively. I have the knowledge to break down what I am looking at clearly and concisely, to simplify and explain large numbers to leaders of my company. During COVID-19, I witnessed the importance of factoring in consumers' habits and marketing issues surrounding the numbers. MSMI helped me see the importance of numbers and quantitative data and how they can be applied to a real company setting.

*How did your classes in the M.S.M.I. program advance your career? *

When I started out my career, I was working at Madison Square Garden in the Marketing Partnerships department. At GAP, I transitioned into a more analytical and digital behind-the-scenes position. I was able to make this transition to a media-focused position because the curriculum focused on case studies and experiential coursework. Now, I primarily apply the program’s managerial implications. When you throw data points in front of colleagues that aren’t in the weeds of it every day, it can look foreign. Being able to pull out what matters is critical to driving the most effective marketing. In every course, we were always asked, “Why does this matter?” Today, I find myself asking that question daily!

*What was your favorite course, and why? *

My favorite course was Customer-Driven Marketing. I liked learning about a company holistically and how marketing can easily be integrated and enhanced. The class was super interactive. We discussed the consumer journey and how to best provide for the brand and the customer.

I aimed to grow as a holistic professional in marketing technology roles while specializing in ad-tech to design, measure, and optimize advertising tactics using different platforms and services.

*What attracted you to the M.S.M.I. program at Fordham?*

Marketing Intelligence at Fordham is the only program where I was able to get the expected courses in a convenient amount of time. The admission process is interview-based, so I was even more inclined to join as I learned a lot about the school and the courses during the interview. The MSMI program is a reasonably fast-paced program created with a clear goal in mind. Fewer electives and robust coursework were the key pieces for me to join MSMI at Fordham.

*What was the biggest advantage you gained from the program?*

The coursework in the M.S.M.I. program covers both fundamentals and advanced topics focused on data analysis and decision making. Students get to discuss the business problems of multiple functions and industries and gear out the best solutions and approaches that may strongly benefit a company.

In this program, I acquired knowledge and experience from workshops, group projects, and case studies in all of the courses. This helped me prepare for my current position where I make managerial decisions with stakeholders from multiple teams such as analytics, growth marketing, advertising, privacy, data engineering, and data science on customizing and scaling various targeting strategies. Another advantage was the unlimited possibilities of learning with students of different educational backgrounds and the great mix of relevant coursework including functional and technical topics.

*How did your classes in the M.S.M.I. program advance your career? *

MSMI provides a unique balance of multiple study streams that students can follow to design their careers. Irrespective of the work experience one brings to the M.S.M.I. program, everybody learns something new and valuable that is completely applicable in the real industry problem statements. The M.S.M.I. program elevated my overall knowledge and skills and opened me up to multiple opportunities since the curriculum provides a perfect set of courses that explore the qualitative and quantitative sides of marketing intelligence along with specialized electives.

Currently, at Media.Monks, I manage and implement clients' global portfolios for their complete digital transformation. I build and refine long-term strategies for clients, make them comfortable with all the steps involved, and brainstorm and implement advanced use cases to assess and optimize the business goals.

*What was your favorite course, and why?*

All of the courses are extremely relevant and prepare students for developing a data-driven approach for real-world challenges. The ‘Applied Project’ provides an opportunity to solve business problems by brainstorming ideas with senior executives.
