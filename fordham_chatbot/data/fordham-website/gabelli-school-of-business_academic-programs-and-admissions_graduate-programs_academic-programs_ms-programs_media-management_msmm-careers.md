# M.S.M.M. Careers

**We took an old-fashioned approach to learning what media-industry recruiters are looking for.We called them up and asked.**

The Gabelli School created the Master of Science in Media Management (MSMM) program based on the real-world needs of today’s media executives. While other universities house their media-management programs within communications departments, ours lives in—and adopts the sensibilities of—the business school.

This gives our graduates a competitive position right out of the gate. They enter the job market with the management training, practical experience, and well-honed business instincts that media employers told us they wanted.
