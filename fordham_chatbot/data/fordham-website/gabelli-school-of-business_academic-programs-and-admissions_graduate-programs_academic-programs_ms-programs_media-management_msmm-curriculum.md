# M.S.M.M. Curriculum

**Take your classroom learning straight to real-world challenges.**

The Gabelli School of Business emphasizes real-world skills. Our accomplished faculty give students the perspective they need to apply lessons from coursework to contemporary business problems, not only in the context of New York, but also in the global marketplace.

The Master of Science in Media Management (M.S.M.M.) curriculum covers a range of topics relevant to today’s media landscape, from international media systems to sports media to social media. MSMM students benefit from direct access to our faculty’s original research, and they attend media events throughout the year to discuss trends with New York executives and build their professional networks.
