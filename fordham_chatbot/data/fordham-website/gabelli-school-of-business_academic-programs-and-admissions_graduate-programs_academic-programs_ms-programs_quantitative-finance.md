**A master’s program based on field data and measurable results.What else would you expect from a bunch of quants?**

When we set out to create a Master of Science in Quantitative Finance (M.S.Q.F.) program, we left nothing to chance.

Right from the beginning when the program's curriculum design was based on the feedback and input from industry experts, the Program constantly seeks input from senior industry professionals and has maintained its distinctive focus on applied, cutting-edge, quantitative techniques. The emphasis of the current curriculum on AI, ML, FinTech, and Computational Finance reflects this focus.

By continually optimizing our curriculum in consultation with industry experts, we’ve achieved remarkable results: **85 to 90% of our graduates find jobs within three months of graduation. Within six months, that figure approaches 100%.**

**GENEROUS SCHOLARSHIPS AVAILABLE FOR THOSE WHO QUALIFY.**
