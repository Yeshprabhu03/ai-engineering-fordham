# M.S.Q.F. Careers

**Is it possible to engineer the perfect job candidate? **

That’s the question we asked ourselves when we began designing the Master of Science in Quantitative Finance (M.S.Q.F.) program. We decided to pursue the answer through market intelligence, interviewing managers at 20 leading finance firms to learn what they were looking for in future employees. Their top requests?

- Quantitative experts who can apply their skills specifically to the field of finance
- Candidates with demonstrated experience solving real-world financial problems
- Hard workers who can perform under pressure

Clearly, the Gabelli School’s M.S.Q.F. program delivers: Nearly 100% of our graduates are employed within six months of graduation.
