I’m a quantitative analyst at AIG’s asset management group.

*Describe your experience in the Gabelli School M.S.Q.F. program.*

I joined the program after earning a bachelor’s degree in computer science in China. It was really challenging keeping up with the intensive class schedule, especially when all my classes were being taught in my second language. I definitely suffered from those pains; however, with great struggle came great reward. Little by little, the challenges reaped an extremely rich and copious harvest.

*What other skills did you learn at the Gabelli School?*

The intensive schedule taught me good time-management skills. The various team projects helped me become a better team player. The well-rounded program design that included math, programming, and finance widened my career choices, and my brilliant and diligent classmates inspired and continue to inspire me in all aspects.

*What’s the biggest advantage you gained from the Gabelli School M.S.Q.F. program?*

In almost every class, we had to create a deliverable that would be presented to the professor at the end of the semester. It mimics the way work is done in the real world, where you have to present your ideas and defend them.
