# M.S.T. Curriculum

**An emphasis on “soft” skills translates into a very solid advantage.**

Effective communication. Creative problem-solving. Strategic vision. We believe it takes much more than technical prowess at the Gabelli School to excel in taxation. We teach our students how to become respected leaders in a corporate setting, preparing them for a more challenging and rewarding career trajectory.

Taught by working professionals in the taxation field, the Master of Science in Taxation (M.S.T.) curriculum emphasizes up-to-the-minute tax law and trends, giving students experience in solving real-world challenges.
