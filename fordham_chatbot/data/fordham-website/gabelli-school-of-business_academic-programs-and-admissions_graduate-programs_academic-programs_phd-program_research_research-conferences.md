# Research Conferences

The Gabelli School Ph.D. program is active in sponsoring large-scale research conferences on an annual basis.

**The Rising Stars Conference**

The Rising Stars Conference is a high-level finance conference that honors four rising scholars, many of whom already hold chaired professorships and have ample publication records. The event sees four rising stars deliver papers, which are then discussed by some of the most distinguished scholars in the field. The Rising Stars Conference is also the occasion for the Trailblazer in Finance Keynote Lecture, which is an honor granted to bold, innovative thinkers who have set the standard for creativity and rigor in the profession.
