# Virtual Format

The virtual format of the Gabelli Business Bridge program contains all the same detailed business topics as a traditional in-class program.

We understand that connecting with your classmates, faculty, staff, and students is a vital part of the program. The online version provides these opportunities via group work, project discussions, and faculty interactions.

You will be supported by our staff as well in all aspects of the program. We will give you the guidance you need for success, help you organize and manage study groups, and answer questions about the content and progress of the program. We will also help you understand questions you may have about the material and tasks at hand.

**Online Technology**

The virtual program will use Zoom video conferencing to ensure the maximum collaboration and interaction of the classes and sessions.

**Virtual Study Groups**

You will work with your group on classwork and the group project. You will meet often with your group (by Zoom or otherwise) and, in part, be guided by our staff.

**Additional support**

Our staff will provide students with support in all sections of the program. Staff will help manage groups, explain some content, and mentor students where appropriate. Staff will also help students to understand classroom material as necessary. They may additionally help faculty organize many aspects of class to ensure participant success.

**Our Commitment**

In order to ensure the health and safety of our community, the 2022 Bridge Program will be offered completely virtual. In recognition of the importance of interacting with classmates, faculty, guests, staff, etc., we will ensure that you have the opportunities to connect as often as possible via group projects and team building activities, simulations, and ample time to meet directly with faculty.
