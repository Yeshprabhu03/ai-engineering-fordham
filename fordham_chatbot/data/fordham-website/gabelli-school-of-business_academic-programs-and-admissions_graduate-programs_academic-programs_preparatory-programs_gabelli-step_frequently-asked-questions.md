Virtual Week: July 21–25, 2025

**Q: Is Gabelli STEP required?**

No. STEP is optional but highly recommended for international MS students who want to begin grad school with momentum — academically, professionally, and socially.

**Q: Will I receive academic credit?**

No. Gabelli STEP is a non-credit enrichment program. You will receive a formal Certificate of Completion to add to your résumé and discuss in interviews.

All incoming international MS students at the Gabelli School of Business are eligible — except students in the International Business Bridge (IBB) program.

STEP happens before the semester begins and is designed as a focused launchpad, not a remedial program. You’ll be ahead of the curve, not catching up.

**Q: What if I already have experience studying in the U.S.?**

Great! STEP is still for you. It’s designed for high-performing students who want deeper insights, real-world exposure, and community before classes begin.

**Q: What’s the registration deadline?**

June 13, 2025, or earlier if capacity is reached. We recommend registering early.

**Q: Do I need to buy materials?**

Nope — all materials are provided and included in your tuition.

**Q: How much does Gabelli STEP cost?**

The total program fee is $1,500 — all activities, sessions, site visits, and materials are included.
