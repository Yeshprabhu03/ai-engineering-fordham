**Does your application package need a boost before you apply to a U.S. business school?**

The International Business Bridge (IBB) program at Fordham’s Gabelli School of Business gives international students a pathway to boost towards graduate-level U.S. business degree programs. For most participants, the IBB program takes place over the course of one year, with two semesters and 30 credits of courses. Students take a mixed program of English language courses and immersive language business courses to prepare them for a fast-paced graduate business degree.

In just two semesters, the Fordham IBB will help:

- Greatly improve your English skills
- Build a solid foundation in business theory and practice
- Prepare you for graduate-level business coursework
- Introduce you to an amazing network of students from around the world

Participants in the IBB program should work with a member of the Gabelli Graduate Admissions team to discuss their candidacy for a [specialized master's program](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/graduate-programs/academic-programs/ms-programs/). If you were held back by your test scores or need more preparation before graduate school, the International Business Bridge program will help you achieve the goal of pursuing graduate studies.
