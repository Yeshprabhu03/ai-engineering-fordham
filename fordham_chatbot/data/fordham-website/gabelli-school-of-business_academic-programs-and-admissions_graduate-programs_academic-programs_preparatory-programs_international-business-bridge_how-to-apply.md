-
The IBB is for international students who hold the equivalent of a four-year bachelor’s degree. In certain cases, it replaces the final year of university; please check with your school and with Fordham to make this determination. We will accept evaluations from World Education Services (WES), Educational Credential Evaluators (ECE) or any NACES organization member.

-
GPA determination will be reviewed by admissions upon receiving a transcript evaluation. 3.0 GPA is considered a straight “B” average. Please feel free to reach out to admissions if you are unsure about our grade determination.

-
Students with a TOEFL (iBT) score of under 100, IELTS under 7, PTE under 86 and DET under 120 are welcome to apply. We reserve the right to evaluate an applicant’s English based on an admission interview.
