# Pre-M.B.A. Program

The Pre-MBA is an exciting opportunity to begin taking courses within our rigorous MBA program before committing to the Professional MBA degree. If you are unsure whether an MBA is right for you, if you have never taken a business course, or if you have less work experience than our Professional MBA student profile (less than 4 years), the Pre-MBA may be right for you! Plus, we will automatically award a $5K scholarship to Pre-MBA students that are admitted to and start the Professional MBA program (awarded in the first term of study in the Professional MBA program).

*Please note: the Pre-MBA program is only open to students that plan to pursue our Professional (Part-time) MBA. *

*Pre-MBA to Professional MBA scholarships ($5K) are only available to new Pre-MBA students. Scholarships will be awarded to Pre-MBA students entering the Professional MBA program beginning Fall 2020.*
