# D.P.S. Program

The Doctor of Professional Studies (D.P.S.) program offers doctoral-level education for the practitioner community.

This three- or four-year program—similar in nature to a Doctor of Business Administration degree—is designed for experienced individuals who seek higher-level roles in business, entrepreneurship, or education.

The curriculum prepares graduates for future pursuits in private or public corporations, nonprofit organizations, financial institutions, universities, or government agencies.

Students may focus their studies in one of three areas:

- Strategy and Decision-Making
- Capital Markets
- Business Economics

Most students complete the program in four years, though some advanced candidates may be able to finish in three.

## International Partnership with BiMBA

Fordham has a rich and long-standing partnership with Peking University in Beijing, and this collaboration now extends to the Gabelli School’s DPS program.

The Beijing International MBA (BiMBA) at Peking University was founded in 1998 as the first joint international MBA program in Beijing approved by the Chinese government. It is a joint educational venture, between Peking University and its global partners, operated by the National School of Development at Peking University.

An inaugural Beijing-based class of the Gabelli School DPS began their studies at Peking University in March 2016. These students take classes at Fordham’s Lincoln Center campus in the summer and study in Beijing during the remainder of the year.

### D.P.S. Admissions

A minimum 3.0 grade point average is desired.

Applicants who earned their previous degree(s) in a language other than English must demonstrate proficiency in English via standardized tests such as the GMAT and TOEFL.

The [Gabelli School admissions office](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/graduate-programs/graduate-admissions/) selects candidates to interview based on their review of three primary criteria:

- Demonstrated success in university-level degree programs
- Demonstrated success in professional experiences
- Assessed potential to complete the DPS program and to contribute to development in an organization or a community of business practice
