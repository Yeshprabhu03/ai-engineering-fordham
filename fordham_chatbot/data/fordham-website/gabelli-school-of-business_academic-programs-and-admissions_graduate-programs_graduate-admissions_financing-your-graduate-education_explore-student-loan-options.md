# Explore Student Loan Options

Student loan options are available through the University for U.S. citizens and permanent residents and non-U.S. citizens. You may find other options from the [Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC)](http://www.gmac.com/).

Student Loan Options for U.S. Citizens and Permanent Residents

Students have access to non-need-based loan funding (loans that start accruing interest at disbursement) to cover expenses associated with their degree. Your total financial aid (scholarships, fellowships, and all education loans) can’t exceed the financial aid budget for the academic year, which includes tuition, fees and living expenses (see below).

The Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan program is available to all U.S. citizens and permanent residents who meet basic federal requirements (i.e., student has never defaulted on a federal loan, is not currently involved in filing bankruptcy, is registered for Selective Service, etc). You can borrow either Federal Direct Graduate PLUS or private student loan funds to supplement the unsubsidized loan annual maximum of $20,500.

Fordham University and the Gabelli School of Business do not have a preferred list of lenders for U.S. Citizens and Permanent Residents. You should thoroughly research private lenders to determine which is best for you.

Student Loan Options for Non-U.S. Citizens

**Private Education Loans (for students with a U.S. co-signer)**

Non-U.S. citizen students who have a credit-worthy U.S. citizen or U.S. permanent resident co-signer may also be eligible for private education loans through lenders such as Sallie Mae, Wells Fargo, [Discover](https://www.discover.com/student-loans/), and CharterOne. You should research private education loan lenders to determine which is best for their individual situation.

**Private Education Loans (that may not require a co-signer)**

You should also explore loan options that may be available through other resources, some of which are dependent on your country of citizenship. Some of these will have specific requirements for the borrower as outlined by the lender, bank, or government, so you should contact the lending agency directly for details on each program. Below is a list of possible programs, but this is not a comprehensive list.
