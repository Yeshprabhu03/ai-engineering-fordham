## Don’t Forget Important Dates!

The Office of Admissions carefully considers each part of your application and as a whole during the admissions process. This helps us to ensure that the program to which you are applying fits your academic and professional goals *and* that you will be able to contribute in meaningful ways to the learning experience. Submitting your application **early** with **all** **components complete** allows us to provide you with a timely decision and can also qualify you for incentives such as **application fee waivers** and **priority scholarships**. We’ve streamlined our process to make it easy. Don’t miss these opportunities!
