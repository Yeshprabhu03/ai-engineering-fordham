Imagine being able to mention that kind of experience in a job interview.

So-what is your full semester abroad going to be like?

Maybe you'll be able to answer some of these questions ...

- What's it like to meet executives at UBS in Geneva or at a Chilean vineyard?
- How do you respectfully make a comment in a Beijing boardroom?
