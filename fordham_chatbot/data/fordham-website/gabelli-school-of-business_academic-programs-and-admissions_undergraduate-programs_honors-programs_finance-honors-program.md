[Finance](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/undergraduate-programs/majors-and-concentrations/finance/) is the academic choice of so many Gabelli School students that we introduced several honors-level programs to improve the finance student experience.

These programs are available to juniors and seniors, but students’ performance in their freshman and sophomore years sets the stage for them to participate.

The programs are:


-
[Chartered Financial Analyst track](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/undergraduate-programs/honors-programs/finance-honors-program/chartered-financial-analyst-cfa-program/): Prepares students to take the CFA Level I exam right after graduation. CFA certification is the finance industry’s gold standard in the mastery of investment principles. -
[Finance Scholars](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/undergraduate-programs/honors-programs/finance-honors-program/finance-scholars/): High-performing sophomores who are interested in Wall Street careers are invited to join this select group, which often places 100% of participants each year in internships at major financial institutions. -
[Student Managed Investment Fund](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/undergraduate-programs/specialty-programs/student-managed-investment-fund/): Work with 23 top classmates in finance to invest $1 million of Fordham’s endowment with the guidance of a faculty investment expert.

Actively participating in finance student organizations—the Finance Society and Alternative Investment Club—and taking part in
[academic competitions](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/undergraduate-programs/specialty-programs/academic-competitions/) in finance can advance a Fordham finance student’s academic career, too.
