# Global Business Honors Program

The four-year Global Business Honors Program selects incoming first years with stellar high school academic records and prepares them for high-level roles in the world's most dynamic firms and organizations. The 25 students in each GBHP class form a close-knit community of friends and scholars.

## What makes this program special?

### Its name tells all.

"Global business" means that participants experience an [intensive international business curriculum](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/undergraduate-programs/honors-programs/global-business-honors-program/global-business-honors-program-coursework/) and travel together on [intercontinental trips](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/undergraduate-programs/honors-programs/global-business-honors-program/global-business-honors-program-travel/): to London and either Asia or Latin America.

"Honors" means that Global Business Honors Program core-curriculum courses are especially rigorous and in-depth. This includes classes in business mathematics, microeconomics and macroeconomics, information systems, business communications and financial management.

[honors courses](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/undergraduate-programs/honors-programs/global-business-honors-program/global-business-honors-program-coursework/)and three courses from the regular curriculum. - Seniors complete an
