# Honor Societies

Gabelli students who excel in their studies may be invited to join one or more national or international honor societies. There are also business student honor societies that are unique to Fordham. Membership in these prestigious organizations is a credential that holds merit in the eyes of potential employers and graduate schools.

## Fordham Honor Societies

[The Boyle Society](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/undergraduate-programs/honors-programs/honor-societies/boyle-scholars/)

The Father William Emmett Boyle Society is the Gabelli School of Business’s own honor society. Its members exemplify the Jesuit values of its namesake, a former business school dean, professor and student advisor who served Fordham for many years.

As mentors and tutors for fellow Gabelli students, and as research assistants to Fordham faculty, Boyle Society members contribute to the greater good and embody the Jesuit principle of being “men and women for others.” Members also receive special guidance from the dean’s office staff in preparing applications for scholarships at the university, regional and national levels, and in securing fellowships and assistantships.
