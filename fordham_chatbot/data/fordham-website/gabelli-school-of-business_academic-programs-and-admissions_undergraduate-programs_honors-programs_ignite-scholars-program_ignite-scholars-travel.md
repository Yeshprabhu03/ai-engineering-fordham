# Ignite Scholars Travel

Learning doesn’t happen purely from a textbook, and it doesn’t take place only in a classroom, either.

The Ignite Scholars Program includes two trips to hubs of innovation in other areas of the United States: one in sophomore year and one in junior year. All the scholars in that particular year travel together, participating in:

- Visits to meet leaders of forward-thinking corporations, nonprofits, and other organizations
- Lectures at a university in the destination area or city
- A community-impact project

Networking opportunities with people who are considered “changemakers” in that area of the country

Ignite Scholars Trips

**North Carolina (Sophomore Year)**: A trip focused on social enterprises and industrial cooperatives as a means for economic development. Students will explore the economic and social impact of alternative ways to foster regional economic growth.

**Rotating Destinations (Junior Year)**: The junior year Ignite trip features a rotating roster of destinations, each focused on how innovation is reshaping the local economy and impacting the community.
