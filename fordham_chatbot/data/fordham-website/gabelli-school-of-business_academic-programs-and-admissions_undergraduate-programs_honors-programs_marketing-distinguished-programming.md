# Marketing Distinguished Programming

The Gabelli School’s [marketing program](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/undergraduate-programs/majors-and-concentrations/marketing/) teaches students to think strategically and to make smart business decisions that benefit not only companies and individuals, but also society at large.

Marketing is such a popular academic choice of many Gabelli School students that we introduced several honors-level programs to improve the marketing student experience.

These programs are:

-
[Marketing Scholars Program](/gabelli-school-of-business/academic-programs-and-admissions/undergraduate-programs/honors-programs/marketing-distinguished-programming/marketing-scholars/): Students apply in their sophomore year for acceptance in this prestigious group of high-performing students interested in pursuing careers in marketing. -
**Paul Reilly BBDO-Gabelli Advertising Fellowship Program:**Launched in 2016, the Paul Reilly BBDO-Gabelli Advertising Fellowship Program provides a selected student with a 10-week, paid summer internship in the account management department at BBDO World Headquarters in New York City. -
**Alpha Mu Alpha Honor Society:**The national honor society for students of marketing is sponsored by the American Marketing Association. Only marketing students of high academic achievement who attend an institution accredited by the AACSB International are eligible for membership. -
Dedicated to promoting the knowledge and appreciation for marketing in the world around us, the Fordham Marketing Association caters to all students who are interested in the fields of marketing, advertising and public relations.[Fordham Marketing Association:](/gabelli-school-of-business/student-and-career-resources/undergraduate-student-resources/student-organizations/fordham-marketing-association/) Provided students with on-campus access to marketing executives from leading firms such as M&M Mars, Pepsico, NBC Universal, and Sony Music.[Marketing Area Industry Speaker Series](/gabelli-school-of-business/about/new-york-advantage/gabelli-school-guest-speakers/):
