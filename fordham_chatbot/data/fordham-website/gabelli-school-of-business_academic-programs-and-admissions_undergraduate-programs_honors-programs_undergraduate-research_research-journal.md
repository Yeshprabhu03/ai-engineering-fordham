# Research Journal

You’ve probably heard the old adage of academia: “Publish, or perish.”

Luckily, at the Gabelli School, we make it possible for you to publish.

Each year, we take the best original student research and print it in the Fordham Business Research Journal. Inclusion in this publication is a résumé-builder and an especially noteworthy accolade for anyone who wants to continue on for a master’s degree or PhD in a business field.

Gabelli School students publish their research in high-caliber academic journals, too—the same journals where college and university professors all over the world hope to have their scholarly work accepted.
