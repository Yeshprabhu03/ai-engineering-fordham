# Enterprise Architecture

A great organization is built on **great business systems**.

The Enterprise Architecture track prepares students to design and build those systems — and to implement them, manage them and **leverage them to propel a company forward**.

Students who complete this program will understand how to **create new business processes**. Coursework will equip them to handle enterprise-wide integration, enable information sharing, devise novel services and create innovative business models. This track also includes course options about information technology applications within a specific industry, such as health care.
