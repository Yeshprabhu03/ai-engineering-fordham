# Management Concentration

Anyone who holds a job will tell you: Management does not come naturally to most people—including most managers. Good management is a skill and an art.

The Gabelli School offers an education not only in management, but also in strong leadership.

Think of management coursework as training in good decision-making and in how to work well with people, no matter what their background. Students who are fluent in management techniques find themselves able to respond well under pressure and to handle difficult business situations with finesse.
