# Sustainable Business Concentration

Gabelli School students don’t simply want to do business.

**They want to change the world.**

If that’s your mindset, you’ll find a natural home in social innovation and sustainable business — two areas of study where you can learn how to make a difference.

Business with purpose

In these two fast-growing disciplines, you’ll learn to master the “triple bottom line” of people, planet, and profit—a concern to companies such as Coca-Cola, Deloitte, Intel, Adidas, GE, Unilever, Nestlé, and beyond.

You’ll come to understand what turns a leader into a “changemaker,” and how you can apply those skills from the smallest startups to the largest multinational firms.

You will see how business can still turn a profit while benefiting human beings around the world: leading with empathy, providing better working conditions, improving the environment, and finding paths to innovation where others see closed doors.
