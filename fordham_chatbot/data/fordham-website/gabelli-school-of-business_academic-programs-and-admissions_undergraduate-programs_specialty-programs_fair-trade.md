Traveling to India. Finding U.S. markets for products from Africa and Bolivia. Advancing social justice. Are these college experiences you want to have? If so, Fordham's Fair Trade program is for you.

This highly successful international program allows Gabelli School students to import global Fair Trade products to the United States and sell them here - both as an e-commerce venture and at a mobile sales kiosk in Hughes Hall.

In doing so, students get real-world practice in marketing, accounting and other business skills.

Current Fair Trade course offerings include:

- Fair Trade and Microfinance
- Entrepreneurship and Fair Trade
- Fair Trade, Spirituality, and Social Justice
