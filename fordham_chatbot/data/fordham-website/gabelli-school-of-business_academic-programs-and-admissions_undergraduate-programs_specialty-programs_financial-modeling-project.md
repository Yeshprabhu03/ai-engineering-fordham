# Financial Modeling Project

The Gabelli School can teach you to see the future.

(In a sense.)

As a junior, you’ll have the opportunity to take an integrated project course on financial modeling, where you will learn:

- The importance of financial models in the business world
- How to construct a predictive model
- What effects national and world events may have on a company’s finances

What does this mean for you? Imagine you work at Ford. You will have the skills to program an Excel-based financial model that will illustrate how many cars Ford will sell based on varying levels U.S. economic growth. You will be able to show the company how its balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows will be affected.

These are the platforms on which sound business decisions are made. We will teach you to build them.
