# Local Consulting Program

## Your Business Knowledge Can Help Others.

Just ask [St. Barnabas Hospital](http://stbarnabashospital.org/), the [United Nations Global Compact](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/), and the [Hunger Project](http://thp.org/).

These organizations have employed a class of Gabelli School students as pro bono business consultants. The entire class works as a team to brainstorm and develop strategies.

Then, at the end of the semester, students visit the clients on-site and deliver a professional-caliber business presentation of their recommendations.

### Have an Impact

Could you help a brand-new charter school figure out how to market itself to prospective families? Could you help the [New York City mayor’s office](https://www.nyc.gov/mayors-office/) to assess the financial impact of [New York Fashion Week](https://nyfw.com/)?

The Local Consulting Program opens those doors.
