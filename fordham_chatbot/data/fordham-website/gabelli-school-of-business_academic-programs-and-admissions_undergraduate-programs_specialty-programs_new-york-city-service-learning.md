# New York City Service Learning

Community service is more meaningful when it's a project you actually want to do. That's the Idea Behind the Gabelli School's Service Learning Program.

You choose one of the business courses you're already taking in any given semester - and propose a service project that ties in with it.

For example, if you are taking Small Business Finance, you might help the Fordham Road Business Improvement District work with merchants right around the corner from campus.

By completing a certain number of hours and writing about the experience, you earn 1 additional credit for the business course you're taking - usually making it 4 credits rather than 3.

You'll also build your résumé and advance the cause of an organization that means something to you. There's no better example of a win-win.
