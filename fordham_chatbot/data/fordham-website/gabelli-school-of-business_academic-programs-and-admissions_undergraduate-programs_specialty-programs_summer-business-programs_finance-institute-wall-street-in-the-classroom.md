*For High School Students*

**Get a head start on your study of finance.**

The Gabelli School of Business is once again pleased to offer the Finance Institute program geared toward high school students curious about the possibility of studying finance in their future. This program could put you significantly ahead.

"Wall Street in the Classroom is a great introductory level class that not only discusses the aspects of investing but personal finance, economics, and innovation. Mr.Gannon allows the class to participate in thoughtful discussions that further strengthen our understanding of the curriculum and build relationships that last long after the course is concluded. By taking the class, I can now read and understand higher level concepts regarding financial markets that I would not have been able to before this program. It has expanded my horizons within the study of business, not just finance." —George, past participant
