# Bronx-Based

## An Unexpected Land of Opportunity

In the decade leading up to 2011, the Bronx experienced a 305% growth in new businesses, according to Crain’s New York Business—the largest increase of any section of New York City.

This area could be the stage for a business boom that reshapes New York.

We invite you to be a part of it.

### Creative Energy Lives Here

The Bronx is renowned for creativity. Hip hop first emerged in the South Bronx in the early 1970s. Edgar Allan Poe spent part of his life near the corner of Kingsbridge Road and the Grand Concourse. Modern writers Don DeLillo and Tom Wolfe set their bestsellers here.

Your creativity can change the story of the Bronx through innovation in business.

### The Conditions for Commerce

Consider studying in the midst of resources like these:

The New York City Economic Development Corporation’s 11,000-square-foot [BXL Business Incubator](http://www.nycedc.com/program/bxl-business-incubator), set in a phenomenal converted factory building in the South Bronx, and our campus’s own business incubator, the [Fordham Foundry](http://www.fordhamfoundry.org/).

Fordham’s own [Center for Digital Transformation](http://www.fordhamcdt.org/), which holds a Summit on Technology Innovation and Startups in the Bronx that attracts participants from companies such as Accenture, Google, Gilt Groupe, and Siris Capital.

[Yankee Stadium](http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/nyy/ballpark/), home to one of the most profitable franchises in sports business history, and host to recent Gabelli School interns such as Thomas Bannon, BS ’15.

### Boldface Names

Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, is one of the Bronx’s native sons, as is our own Mario Gabelli, BS ’65. The co-founder of securities giant Cantor Fitzgerald, B. Gerald Cantor, lived in the Bronx for 80 years. Fashion business icons Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein were born here.

Al Pacino, Woody Allen, and Grandmaster Flash are from the Bronx. Mark Twain lived here, as did renowned psychologist Stanley Milgram, architect Daniel Libeskind, and graphic designer Milton Glaser, who created the famous logo that says, with a heart, “I Love New York.”

From your perch at Fordham’s Rose Hill, you will love the Bronx.
