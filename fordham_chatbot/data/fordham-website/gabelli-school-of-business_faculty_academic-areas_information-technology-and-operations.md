The information, technology, and operations (ITO) faculty are Fordham's experts in digital technologies and data analytics. Some of the research questions they explore are:

- How do companies gain actionable insights from vast quantities of data?
- How do companies analyze, design, and build technical solutions, optimize their business processes, and transform their business models?
- What are the business implications of social media and other disruptive technologies, such as Big Data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence?
- How should companies invest, use, and manage data and digital technology to achieve strategic business objectives, gain competitive advantages, and improve financial performance?

The ITO faculty also have expertise in integrating all aspects of the product and service lifecycle. Their research examines the execution process that ranges from planning, design, and procurement, to production, distribution, and returns.

Courses in this area equip students with a solid understanding of core technology and operations concepts, rigorous analytical thinking and technical skills, and a creative mindset for problem-solving and decision making. Infused with the partnership with other Gabelli academic units and incorporating new elements such as sustainability, risk management, and innovation, the ITO courses that are particularly relevant in today’s increasingly interdependent and competitive global economy.
