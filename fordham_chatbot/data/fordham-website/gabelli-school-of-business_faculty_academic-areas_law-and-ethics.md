Understanding the law is critical for the effective management of business, especially in today's ever-expanding regulatory environment. To this end, all undergraduate and graduate students take courses in legal studies taught by the business faculty. Fordham's approach includes a crucial additional dimension as well, one that sets it apart from many other schools of business: an education in ethics. It is our belief that business cannot prosper in the long run unless it is conducted ethically. Reflecting Fordham's Jesuit tradition, the law and ethics area asks students to consider—and answer for themselves—complex questions about ethical business conduct, the underlying purpose of business, and whether businesses have an obligation to go beyond making a profit by advancing society. The law and ethics faculty prides itself on a curriculum that allows students to grapple with problems similar to those that they will encounter in the workplace.
