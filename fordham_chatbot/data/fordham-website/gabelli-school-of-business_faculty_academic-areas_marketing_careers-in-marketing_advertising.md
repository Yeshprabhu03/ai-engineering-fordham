An advertising agency is a professional service firm hired by other businesses, corporations, non-profits, and government agencies to create, plan, and produce advertising and sometimes other forms of promotion and marketing activities to sell products or services and meet business objectives for its clients.

Advertising does not work alone. Advertising professionals use IMC (Integrated Marketing Communication) methods to strategically coordinate and integrate brand messages across all points of contact with consumers. This integrated approach assures that the advertised message from clients reaches and connects with the right consumer at the right time and place. Advertising agencies, therefore, employ a range of specialists who assist with planning, creating, and executing IMC campaigns. These roles include strategic brand management and planning, consumer insights and market research, media strategy, buying and planning, customer data management, digital activities, and client relationship management.
