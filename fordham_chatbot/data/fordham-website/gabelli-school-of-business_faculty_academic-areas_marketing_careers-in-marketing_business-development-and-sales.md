Business Development and Sales professionals devise growth strategies, tactics, and action plans to enhance the firm’s markets and create new ones to drive leads and revenue to the business. They coordinate with cross-functional teams to identify leads, pitch to prospective clients, negotiate contracts, and handle all related activities. Business Development (or Sales Development) is typically the entry point to sales. Individuals in these roles are tasked with finding leads (outbound) or developing leads from inbound marketing activities but they do not close the sale. They typically forward the acquired lead to the Sales team to validate, pitch, and close the new deal (often referred to as ‘logo acquisition’).
