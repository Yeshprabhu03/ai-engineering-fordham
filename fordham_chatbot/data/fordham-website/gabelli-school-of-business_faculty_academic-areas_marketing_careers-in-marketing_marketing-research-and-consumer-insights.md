Market research informs marketers about consumers, customers, the industry and line of business, competitors, and the public. This information helps firms identify opportunities and/or challenges, monitor performance, and better understand the business, the consumers, and markets. It helps develop effective marketing strategies and minimizes risks in crucial business decisions. Consumer insights are data-driven observations, thoughts, ideas, and behaviors collected from consumers and analyzed to help businesses make informed decisions about reaching and engaging their target market more effectively. Lessons from marketing, data analytics, and social sciences (anthropology, psychology, and sociology) help companies make strategic and informed decisions about brands and their relationships with consumers. By combining quantitative and qualitative insights about consumers, the industry, and competitors, marketers can discover what matters most to consumers when choosing a specific product or brand and why. This helps firms develop, implement, and improve marketing plans and brand strategies to better serve target customers and create value for them. The roles may be in research firms (suppliers) or client organizations. While roles within the two sides may differ in job descriptions, the roles are not separated due to space constraints.
