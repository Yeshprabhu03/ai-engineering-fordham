**Note: **We acknowledge that a report like this is not exhaustive of all jobs and domains, and some positions may overlap across multiple marketing domains. For example, marketing jobs within retail firms may span all nine domains, and there may be cross- functional teams, such that some individuals may perform more than one job. This report seeks to include the most frequently posted positions in each category and synthesizes other positions within these roles. This has been necessary to maintain the report at a manageable length and keep it useful to readers.
