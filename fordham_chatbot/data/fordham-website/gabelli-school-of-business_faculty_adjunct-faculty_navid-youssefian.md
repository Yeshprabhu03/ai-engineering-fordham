Born in Paris and based in New York, Navid Youssefian is a senior manager on the Revenue Enablement team at MetLife, where he leads data engineering initiatives that power strategic sales and marketing activation for the investment management business. With a career spanning the banking, nonprofit, and tech sectors, he brings a unique blend of analytical precision and creative strategy to his work.

Prior to his current role, Youssefian held positions in strategic and digital marketing, where he built impactful campaigns that bridged brand storytelling with measurable outcomes. Beyond the corporate world, he is a co-founder of *evlovesnyc*, a NYC grassroots nonprofit born in the early days of the pandemic that has since cooked and distributed over 600,000 meals to people in need across all five boroughs.

Outside of work, Youssefian finds inspiration in nature and motion—whether it’s hiking, skiing, or capturing landscapes through drone videography. A passionate soccer enthusiast, he has been a devoted Paris Saint-Germain fan since the age of eight.

Youssefian is always looking to link with creative minds—[feel free to connect with him on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/navidyoussefian)!
