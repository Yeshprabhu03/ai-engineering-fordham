He entered the field of information systems after beginning his career in theoretical physics.

Professor Saharia's research focuses on applications of AI systems, information-systems strategy, database theory, information economics, ERP systems, and service-center management. His projects include AI applications, data visualization in healthcare data breaches, query optimization and query reuse in data-warehousing systems, IT and business alignment, challenges in IT integration in mergers and acquisitions, incentive-compatible contracts, and quality in outsourcing contracts.

Before coming to Fordham, Professor Saharia served on the graduate faculty at the business schools of the University of Washington and University of Illinois, Chicago, supervising Ph.D. candidates at both institutions.

Professor Saharia earned a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from Carnegie Mellon University. He did additional graduate work in operations research, economics, and computer information systems at the University of Rochester.

Professor Saharia's work has appeared in leading journals in information systems and computer science. These include:

*IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering*,*ACM Transactions on Database Systems*,*Information Systems Research*,*Decision Support System*s and the*Journal of Management Information Systems*. Before he made the academic transition from physics to information systems, Professor Saharia's work in physcs was published in leading journals in theoretical physics, including*Physical Review*,*Nuclear Physics,*and*Physics Letters*.Professor Saharia is the director of the Center for Digital Transformation and is the coordinator of Fordham CIO Roundtable. He has served as ITO area chair, director of the Fulltime M.B.A. program, and the director of the M.S. in IT program.
