Albert N. Greco is an expert on the publishing world who researches and teaches at the Gabelli School of Business. His research centers on consumer marketing trends in publishing, as well as in the cultural, retail and financial-service fields. He has investigated the impact of econometric, demographic and technological developments on consumers and their decisions to buy, rent or use the goods and services produced by these industries.

Professor Greco's recent publications have centered on three areas: the supply and the consumer and institutional demand for adult, juvenile, mass-market, religious, professional, scholarly and educational textbooks; why people decide to select a specific book, author or genre; and where consumers buy books, exploring the major channels of distribution: book stores, mass merchants, price clubs, convenience stores and online.

Universities in the United States and abroad have made his publications required or recommended reading for their undergraduate or graduate students, among them Columbia, Northwestern, UCLA, Harvard, Brown, Rochester, Virginia and Georgetown. His research has appeared in Harvard Business School cases, in scholarly books published in the United States and United Kingdom, and in academic journals such as the

*Journal of Marketing, Quantitative Marketing and Economics, Management Science*and*Psychology and Marketing*. His papers have been presented at the World Bank, Harvard University, Cambridge and Oxford Universities, the Library of Congress and the U.S. Department of Commerce.
