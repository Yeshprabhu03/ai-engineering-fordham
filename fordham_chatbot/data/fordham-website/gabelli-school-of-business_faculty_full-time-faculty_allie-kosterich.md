Allie Kosterich is an associate professor of communications and media management at the Gabelli School of Business. She holds a Ph.D. in communication from Rutgers University.

Dr. Kosterich’s research and teaching focus on media management and industry change. In particular, she is interested in understanding the transformation of media industries as a result of technological and social change. She does so by drawing on theory from both management and communication, as well as both quantitative methods such as social network analysis and event history analysis and qualitative methods such as interviews and textual analysis. Her work is supported by funding from the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University where she is a Knight News Innovation Fellow.

Merging theory with practice, Dr. Kosterich has established an active research agenda that studies the interaction of media organizations, institutions, and new technologies. Her work has been widely published in leading academic journals, as well as in the popular press. Dr. Kosterich’s research and teaching interests stem in part from her professional media background, which includes management and production positions in newsrooms and television studios. Prior to that, she earned a B.S. in communication from Cornell University.
