Kevin Jackson is respected as a leading world scholar in business ethics and legal philosophy. His research papers have been published in top-tier journals, among them

*Business Ethics Quarterly, Brooklyn Journal of International Law, Harvard Journal of Law*and*Public Policy and Law and Philosophy*.Dr. Jackson is the author of three books. His

*Charting Global Responsibilities: Legal Philosophy and Human Rights*was presented as a gift to His Holiness the Dalai Lama by the U.S. State Department. The Dalai Lama praised it for its "fascinating chapters, felicitous expositions and fundamental thinking," noting that "it is critical that [reading] this volume become a high-priority task of avant-garde jurists."Another book,

*Building Reputational Capital*, incorporates insights from Dr. Jackson's practical law experience. It represents a significant contribution to the scholarship on how reputation intertwines with political, legal, economic and moral issues — particularly in the global public realm — and offers strategies for corporations and business people seeking to protect and increase their intangible assets.Dr. Jackson's most recent book,

*Virtuosity in Business*, calls on business leaders and executives to expand their thinking by appreciating the profound relevance to business and economics of areas normally reserved for the liberal arts, such as philosophy and music.A professor of law and ethics at Gabelli School of Business and academic director of the graduate division's Three-Continent Master's in Global Management, Dr. Jackson also is a senior fellow with the Witherspoon Institute in Princeton, New Jersey. In 2011, he was awarded the Daniel Janssen Chair in Corporate Social Responsibility at Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management of the Université Libre de Bruxelles. Dr. Jackson taught at Georgetown University in 1990 and 1991, at Peking University in 1999 and 2000, and at Princeton University from 2006 through 2008. He has delivered seminars on business ethics and legal philosophy for organizations and leaders worldwide, and he has been a frequent commentator on the CBS

*Evening News*, CNN, Fox News and National Public Radio.Inspired by the piano teacher he had in his youth, Gray Perry, a protégé of Isidor Philipp, Dr. Jackson remains devoted to music through piano performing, composing and improvising.
