She received her B.A. from Columbia University and her M.F.A. from American Conservatory Theatre. Her research interests span the fields of communication, performance, and narrative studies. Kimberley is also a producer, director and thespian. In her latest project, she served as executive producer of Dignity Street (aka Fordham Road).
