Marcia Flicker completed an M.B.A. and Ph.D. in marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Her background — a blend of retail advertising experience, consulting for JCPenney and an insatiable love of shopping — led her to specialize in marketing science techniques and information-technology applications in retailing and e-business.

With colleagues in Fordham's marketing area, Dr. Flicker co-founded the Center for Positive Marketing, which promotes the message that marketing can be a force for good. By satisfying a variety of consumer needs that result in positive outcomes, from the immediate and concrete to the more abstract and future-oriented, each customer-marketer exchange has the potential to increase individual and societal welfare. Benefits can range from alleviating short-term boredom to improving long-term public health.

In addition to the Gabelli School of Business, Dr. Flicker has taught at the Wharton School, New York University and LaSalle College. She was instrumental in leading Fordham's undergraduate Honors Thesis Program and in launching the master of science in business enterprise degree for recently graduated liberal and fine arts majors. She received a distinguished educator award from the Direct Marketing Education Foundation in 2000 and served as a judge for the Direct Marketing Association's Echo Award competition from 1999 to 2002.

Dr. Flicker's research has been presented to or published by the American Marketing Association, the Direct Marketing Association, the Marketing College of INFORMS, the Association for Consumer Research and Cambridge University Press. She is a member of the Advertising Research Foundation, the Direct Marketing Association and the Retail Marketing Society.
