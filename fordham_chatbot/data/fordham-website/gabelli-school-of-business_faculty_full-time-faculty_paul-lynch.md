Paul V. Lynch is a clinical professor of accounting at Gabelli School of Business. Professor Lynch holds a B.A. and M.A. in economics from Rutgers University; an M.B.A. with concentrations in analytic finance, financial management and statistics from the University of Chicago; and an MBA in professional accounting and a Ph.D. in management, with a major concentration in accounting and minor concentration in finance, from Rutgers University. His research interests focus on accounting for derivative securities, issues in consolidation accounting and corporate finance/valuation. He primarily teaches Advanced Financial Accounting and Intermediate Financial Accounting II at both undergraduate and graduate levels. At Rutgers, Professor Lynch received numerous academic honors, including the Touche Ross A.H. and H.S. Puder Award for academic excellence, and was inducted into Omicron Delta Epsilon and Beta Gamma Sigma. At Fordham, he received the Dean's Award for Teaching Excellence and the Cura Personalis Award and is an active thesis advisor to undergraduate accounting majors in the Gabelli School of Business.

Before entering academia, Professor Lynch began his banking/finance career in June 1991 as an associate in the corporate finance group at UBS Securities, where he worked on team that developed derivative financial products (zero-coupon bond with detachable warrants) and assisted senior bankers in evaluating and structuring financial transactions. In 1994, he joined Capital Markets Assurance Corporation as an associate in product development. There, he evaluated alternative credit rating models from a theoretical and empirical perspective, analyzed issuance costs of asset-backed securities with respect to cash flow structure and credit enhancement and developed a generalized pricing model for multiple-tranch, fixed-income securities. In 1995, he joined the Dial Corporation as manager of acquisition analysis. His primary role at Dial was assisting senior management with the spinoff of the company's consumer products business, estimating the value of Dial Corp. subsidiaries using publicly traded comparables and deal/market multiples and in performing valuation analysis and participating in the due diligence process of prospective acquisition candidates. From 1996 to 2000, Professor Lynch worked at the Globecon Group Ltd., where he developed all written materials and Excel-based valuation models with respect to the pricing and structuring of derivative securities, the valuation of fixed income securities with embedded options and corporate valuation using both discounted cash flow analysis (WACC and APV) and price multiples analysis.

Professor Lynch's various consulting engagements include: estimating economic damages under the Securities Act of 1933 (IPOs) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (10b-5); evaluating and structuring alternative compensation packages for senior executives; initiating coverage on select Internet service providers (ISPs) and application service providers (ASPs); and creating and delivering seminars on financial risk management in England and Germany.
