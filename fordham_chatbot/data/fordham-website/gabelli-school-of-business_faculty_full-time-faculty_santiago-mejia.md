Santiago Mejia joined the Gabelli School of Business in 2017 as an assistant professor in the law and ethics area, after earning his Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Chicago. Professor Mejia has a strong background in philosophy and ethics. His research interests span normative ethical theories of businesses, organizational behavior, moral psychology, and virtue ethics.

Professor Mejia’s research currently gravitates around three major topics:

- Shareholder primacy, the view that firms should be managed in the interest of shareholders. He has shown that shareholder primacy is ethically legitimate, but that it imposes on managers and shareholders more stringent ethical obligations than typically acknowledged. He is currently exploring the normative justifications for shareholder primacy and the limits of this theory of corporate governance
- Empirically informed approaches to virtue ethics. He has been exploring notions of virtue and human excellence that do justice to the empirical results from social psychology, behavioral economics, clinical psychology, and organizational behavior.
- Socratic ignorance, the view that the highest form of human wisdom consists in the recognition of one’s ignorance about the most important human questions. He has been exploring what Socratic ignorance may have to offer to fields such as artificial intelligence, leadership, and the future of work.

Professor Mejia has been named the William J. Loschert Endowed Chair of Social Entrepreneurship during 2023-2025. He was awarded an Early-career scholar Sabbatical Research Fellowship by the Institute of Humane Studies, Fordham’s Distinguished Research Award for Junior Faculty in 2021, the Business Ethics Quarterly Outstanding Article Award in 2019, and the Society of Business Ethics Founders’ Award in 2016.
