Sophia Town, Ph.D., is an assistant professor of organizational behavior at the Gabelli School of Business. As a qualitative researcher, Town explores how leaders can cultivate both knowledge and wisdom in service of individual, organizational, and societal flourishing. Her research program reflects three primary streams of research: (1) wisdom-based leadership, (2) systemic change for human flourishing, and (3) transformative business pedagogy.

In the classroom, Professor Town’s curriculum is guided by the question: “How can we develop compassionate leaders in service of a flourishing world?” She has designed and taught a number of reflective and experiential courses for the undergraduate, M.B.A., and Executive M.B.A. levels, covering topics such as leadership development, emotional intelligence, mindfulness, conflict management, and negotiation. Each course aims to humanize business education by fostering the “knowing,” “doing,” and “being” of wisdom in the workplace.

Regarding transformative pedagogy, Town leads Fordham’s Human Flourishing Project (FHFP), a mixed-methods, interdisciplinary research lab that explores behavioral, psychological, communicative, and spiritual development in business education. Related to this project, she serves as a
