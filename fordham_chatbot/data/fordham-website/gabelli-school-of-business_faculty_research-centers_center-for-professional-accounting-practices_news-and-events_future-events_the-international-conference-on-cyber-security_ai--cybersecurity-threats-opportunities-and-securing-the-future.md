# AI & Cybersecurity: Threats, Opportunities, and Securing the Future

## An Exclusive, Three-Hour Gabelli School Cybersecurity Workshop (GSCW) at

ICCS 2025

As cyber threats become more advanced and relentless, the need for intelligent, adaptive defenses has never been more urgent. This exclusive three-hour workshop—**AI & Cybersecurity: Threats, Opportunities, and Securing the Future**—offers a unique opportunity to explore how Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing modern cybersecurity.

Led by expert faculty and distinguished alumni from **Fordham University**, this session is designed for government officials, executive leaders, law enforcement professionals, educators, and cybersecurity practitioners seeking to stay ahead of rapidly evolving cyber risks.

You’ll gain a strategic understanding of how AI and machine learning power next-generation defenses, witness **live demonstrations** of AI-driven threat detection in action, and take part in **hands-on labs** focused on securing AI systems from emerging threats.

Discover how adversaries are now targeting AI itself—through data poisoning, adversarial machine learning, and prompt injection attacks—and learn how to defend against these cutting-edge techniques. The **Secure AI** segment of the workshop will give you the tools and insights needed to harden your AI systems and ensure they remain reliable, ethical, and secure.

*Seats are limited—don’t miss this dynamic learning experience at ICCS 2025, hosted by Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business and the FBI.*
