**Moderator: Harold Chun**, Director of Security Legal, Google

This panel will explore the divergent approaches to AI and cybersecurity compliance regulation between Europe and the United States, with a specific focus on their implications for law enforcement, national cybersecurity strategies, government oversight, and proactive prevention measures. As AI integration deepens within critical infrastructure and public services, understanding the transatlantic regulatory divide becomes paramount.

The discussion will highlight how the European Union's emphasis on fundamental rights, data protection (e.g., GDPR), and forthcoming AI-specific legislation (e.g., AI Act) shapes its compliance landscape, often leading to more prescriptive and rights-centric frameworks. In contrast, the United States typically adopts a more sector-specific, risk-based, and innovation-driven regulatory philosophy, relying on a patchwork of federal and state laws, agency guidance, and industry-led standards. It will equip legal professionals with insights into anticipated enforcement trends, litigation risks, and strategic considerations for advising clients operating across these distinct regulatory landscapes.
