AI and Cybersecurity

Strategist

In a world where seeing is no longer believing, the rise of deepfakes poses serious threats to public trust, national security, and organizational reputation. This engaging session will explore how AI is being used—not just to create synthetic media—but also to fight back against it.

We’ll uncover how cutting-edge training strategies, like smart learning rate adjustments and automated tuning techniques, can significantly boost the performance of deepfake detection systems. No advanced degree is required—just a curiosity about how AI is evolving to protect truth in the digital age.

Attendees will get a front-row view of how intelligent models can outperform traditional methods through a live demonstration of an advanced AI system trained on high-resolution deepfake content. The session connects AI innovation to real-world impact across cybersecurity, digital forensics, and information assurance.

Whether you’re in risk management, cyber defense or you are exploring AI’s potential, this session offers a compelling look at how today’s technology is shaping tomorrow’s fight against manipulated media.
