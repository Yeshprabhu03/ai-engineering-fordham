# Disrupting Lockbit Ransomware Gang

This comprehensive presentation will focus on the FBI’s efforts to combat LockBit, one of the most prolific ransomware groups in the world, which targeted over 2,000 victims, received more than $120 million in ransom payments, and made ransom demands totaling hundreds of millions of dollars.

In February 2024, The U.K. National Crime Agency’s (NCA) Cyber Division—working in cooperation with the Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and other international law enforcement partners—disrupted LockBit’s operations by seizing numerous public-facing websites used by LockBit to connect to the organization’s infrastructure and seizing control of servers used by LockBit administrators, thereby disrupting the ability of LockBit actors to attack and encrypt networks and extort victims by threatening to publish stolen data.

This presentation will detail the evolving cyber threat landscape and will emphasize the critical role of public-private collaboration in countering cybercriminal activity.
