**Moderator: Elizabeth Rossi**, Quantum AI Program Manager, Google

At Google Quantum AI, our mission is to build quantum computing for otherwise unsolvable problems. This talk will explore the foundational principles of quantum computing and discuss why it's such a crucial technology and a powerful tool for computation. We'll detail the current state of the field and how to assess claims about its future development. We'll dive into our strategy and roadmap for developing large-scale, error-corrected quantum computers, highlighting key advancements in quantum hardware and software, from current breakthroughs in error correction to future applications in fields like medicine, materials science, and AI.
