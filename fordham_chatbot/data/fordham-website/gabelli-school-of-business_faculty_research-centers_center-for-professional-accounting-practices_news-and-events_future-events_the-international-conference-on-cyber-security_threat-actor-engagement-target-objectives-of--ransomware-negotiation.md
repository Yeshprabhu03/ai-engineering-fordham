Ransomware negotiation is both an art and a science. It requires carefully planned strategy, deep psychology, fortitude, and discipline, and can potentially reduce the ransom demand, gather information about the attackers, and buy time for recovery. This fascinating parallel session will provide insights into the complexities of ransomware negotiation, using a ransomware incident scenario to explore the strategic planning, operational delivery, communications, benefits, and pitfalls of ransomware negotiation, sanctions checking, and ransomware settlement.
