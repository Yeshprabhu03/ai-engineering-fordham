Mark Conrad

Hello and welcome to the Sports Business Podcast. The show that explores cutting edge issues in the world of professional, college, recreational and Olympic sports. My name is Mark Conrad or Prof. C and I teach at Fordham University's Gabelli School of Business, where I serve as professor of law and ethics and the director of its Sports Business Initiative. Through the Sports Business Podcast, I will explore, discuss, debate and analyze the legal, ethical, societal, as well as business issues in this ever changing landscape of sports.00;00;54;00 - 00;01;28;22

But what will make this podcast unique is that I am not going to be a cheerleader for the industry. Rather, I may praise, may criticize, may seek change in the current sports scene. In one episode, I may ask tough questions. In another I may state controversial views. In another I may interview guests with different and unusual perspectives. The future of college sports, civil rights, athletes who challenge the structure, changing youth sports, staging the Olympics.00;01;28;25 - 00;01;54;22

Guests may include present or former athletes, coaches, owners, lawyers, medical specialists, authors, activists for social change, or those who wish to keep the status quo, and those wanting to even end the system and rebuild from the ground up. Often, guests will be people you've never heard of but should hear about, and there will also be time for some fun.00;01;54;24 - 00;02;28;22

The occasional discussion that may fuse sports and arts, sports and comedy, sports and history, or sports issues for the weekend warriors not out to break records, but to enjoy and compete. I want this podcast to be the go to place for the trends, the controversies and the good stuff. At the end of each year, I will broadcast Prof. C’s Prophecies where I will look into my crystal ball to predict the future of sports in the next year.00;02;28;25 - 00;02;56;02


Mark Conrad

I have been associated with Fordham's Gabelli School for over 35 years, and I have taught and researched legal and business issues and sports for most of that time. I have spoken at many leading academic institutions and have been frequently quoted in the media. I am totally psyched to lead this podcast and I hope you'll enjoy listening as much as I am thrilled to be a part of it.00;02;56;04 - 00;03;41;12

The Sports Business podcast will be a place to hear incisive interviews, trenchant commentary, and even some fun and humor. I would like to thank the administration of the Gabelli School of Business, Dean Lerzan Aksoy, and fellow administrators and faculty, and Fordham University as a whole for their support. I welcome you to the Sports Business Podcast as Prof. C and hope you will join us in the future.
