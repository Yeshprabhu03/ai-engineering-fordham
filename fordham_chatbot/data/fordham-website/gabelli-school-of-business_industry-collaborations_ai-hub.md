# Gabelli AI Hub

## Fordham AI Hub

**Powered by the Gabelli School of Business**

At unprecedented speed, artificial intelligence is reshaping how we live, learn, and do business—creating both opportunity and responsibility for today’s leaders. Anchored at the Gabelli School of Business and informed by Fordham University’s Jesuit commitment to purpose and service to society, the Fordham AI Hub is New York City’s home for ethical, applied AI grounded in discipline-specific expertise, academic rigor, and experiential learning. The Hub connects companies, entrepreneurs, policymakers, students, and community partners to harness AI responsibly for growth, innovation, and meaningful impact.

## AI x Business Education

The Hub’s physical space is in development, but initiatives launched in Fall 2025 with programming focused on community, industry partnerships, and the future of work.

We are focused on a platform to grow talent, commercialize solutions, and drive inclusive economic growth. The Hub serves a role that only Fordham can fill, turning ethical AI business innovation into real-world implementation.
