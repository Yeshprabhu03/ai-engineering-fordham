A collaboration between Amazon trained managers in successful methods for developing high-performance teams. This one-day custom executive training program included morning classroom sessions and afternoon hands-on team-building activities for senior-level fulfillment center managers.

- Participants learned key lessons on the psychology behind team dynamics
- Research and case studies focused on ways to apply each lesson at Amazon
- Activities included a live jazz band as an illustration for group work

“The workshop was incredibly well received and extremely enjoyable. Our general manager could not stop raving about the content. I’m sure we will be recommending this to other sites in our area.”

- Frank Lugo, Senior Operations Manager, Amazon
