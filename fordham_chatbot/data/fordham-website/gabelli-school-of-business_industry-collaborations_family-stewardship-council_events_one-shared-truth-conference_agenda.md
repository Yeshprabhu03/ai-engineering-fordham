Breakout Sessions & Startup Showcase

**Breakout 1: DAO Design Canvas Workshop**

The DAO Design Canvas Breakout utilizes a canvas-like tool developed by Felipe Duarte (founder of the DAOist) to guide groups through the process of making the most vital decisions they face in the process of designing a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)—soft versus hard governance, on versus off chain—no matter what platform. The process of exploring the Canvas yields well-defined use cases, a powerful educational experience. and high-quality dialogue that often leads into action. The DAO Design Canvas came out of the co-creation in the Genesis Alpha DAO (DAOStack’s first DAO) and has been used to design the CuraDAO, the dHack DAOs, among others.

**Breakout 2: Building on Chain**

A practical session for developers, founders, and anyone interested in creating scalable, secure blockchain applications. Industry experts will discuss the tools, networks, and design considerations behind modern on-chain systems, featuring insights from projects such as Sui, Ripple and Base.

We are excited to host a dedicated Women in Blockchain/Crypto breakout focused on connection, conversation, and community. This session would bring together women across crypto, blockchain, and finance for meaningful dialogue, relationship-building, and shared experiences in the space.
