# Third Annual FSC Conference

**SAVE THE DATEDecember 5, 2025**

**Fordham University | New York, NYSchool of Law | 150 West 62 nd StreetCostantino Hall, 2nd Floor**

Through the curation of intellectually deep, yet pragmatically important panels, showcases and workshops, the Family Stewardship Council at Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business is entering its third year of thought-leadership.

Join us for our Third Annual FSC Conference, packed with perspective-expanding conversations and ample networking opportunities with Family Firms, Funds, Foundations & Offices.

The guest of honor for our annual Fireside Chat will be the Honorable Patrick J. Murphy, Executive Director of the Hilco Global Geopolitical Unit, former Congressman (PA-08) and former Under Secretary of the U.S. Army under President Obama. The conversation will touch on the geopolitical landscape and build on the +Alpha Panel on “Outer Space as Triptych.”

The annual +Alpha Panel introduces a non-traditional investment thesis to the FSC community. Last year’s conference highlighted “Monetizing Fandom” for attendees, exploring how restructuring in the entertainment industry is creating new channels for investment and increased opportunities for generational wealth creation. This year’s +Alpha panel discussion will focus on “Outer Space as Triptych: National Security Imperative, Investment Frontier, & Public Goods Consideration.”

Panel conversations include:

- “Outer Space as Triptych: National Security Imperative, Investment Frontier, & Public Goods Consideration”
- “Narratives as Glue: Family Firms, Offices & Foundations”
- “Patient Capital during Impatient Times: Private Debt & Private Equity Markets”

The conference is made possible through the generous support of Muzinich & Co.
