During her internship at Loyola’s Family Business Center, Fitzgerald met families, listened to generational stories, and sat in on family business seminars. It was not until this moment that she appreciated succession planning, next generation education, estate planning, or governance. She began to understand the terms and use them in my daily life.Celine Fitzgerald

Since beginning her family’s single-family office in 2019, Fitzgerald is continuing to learn and develop best practices for her family unit. While she is proud to say that she has dabbled in the investment side of the office (even sourcing a few deals), taken three American Banker Association courses (banking is the family business), Fitzgerald truly thrives with philanthropy. She has taken over her family’s donor-advised fund and launched the family foundation.
