The Center awards annual fellowships to graduate students with a demonstrated commitment to ethical leadership and socially responsible innovation in business.

Each Academic Year, the fellowship launches in the Spring semester. Applications are available in September with an application deadline in November. Key elements of the fellowship will include learning and development sessions, networking, and a research project, where students will design and create their own responsible business project.

*What kind of project will fellows work on during the fellowship, and what are the available focus areas?*

Each fellow will design and complete an independent project focused on a responsible business issue—such as, but not limited to, climate action, ethical supply chains, or impact investing. Projects can take the form of a research paper, business plan, video, podcast, or other creative or strategic output. Fellows must choose one of three pathways: Research & Analysis, Advisory/Consulting, or Venture & Innovation.

**Who is eligible to apply?**

Graduate students enrolled in at least six credits during the Spring semester.
