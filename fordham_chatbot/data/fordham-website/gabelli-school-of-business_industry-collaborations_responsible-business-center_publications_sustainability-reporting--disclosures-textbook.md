Designed as both a teaching resource and a professional guide, the text explores key frameworks, reporting standards, and international regulations shaping today’s corporate disclosures, including GRI, ISSB, and the EU’s CSRD. Through real-world examples, case studies, and activity-based exercises, readers gain insights into how companies navigate sustainability challenges, assess costs and benefits, and manage risks. Faculty will find it easy to integrate into courses—even without prior expertise—while finance and accounting professionals will strengthen their ability to interpret and evaluate ESG disclosures.

Set for publication in January 2026, with ongoing online updates, the textbook emphasizes long-term value creation over short-term gains.

*“The textbook has been created to support and enable faculty to teach a subject matter that is **dynamic, complex, and challenging. It is also designed for individuals in the finance and **accounting fields as a resource to understand the topic of disclosure, which is new,” Porco said.*

By demystifying the complexities of sustainability reporting, this resource empowers future business leaders to deliver transparency, accountability, and meaningful impact to their stakeholders.
