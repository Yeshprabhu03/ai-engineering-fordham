# Social Profit Orientation

Social Profit Orientation is an organization-wide perspective whereby entities embrace in their core mission the creation of sustainable, positive social and/or environmental impacts on individuals, communities, and society at large.

Organizations that embrace a social profit orientation proactively invest resources such as knowledge, infrastructure, labor, reputation, money, and time with the explicit goal of enhancing the common good, especially improving the well-being of people and safeguarding the health of the planet.

A social profit orientation (SPO) reflects a deliberate, conscious organizational effort to address systemic social or environmental challenges—it is not merely a by-product of making financial profits.
