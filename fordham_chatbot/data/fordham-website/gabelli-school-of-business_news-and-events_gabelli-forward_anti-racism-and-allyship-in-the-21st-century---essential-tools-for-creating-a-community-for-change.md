Gabelli Forward is proud to partner with The Gabelli School's Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion on this incredibly important session. It is our goal at the Gabelli School, that by actively engaging in anti-racist work, and sharing our learnings across our community, we can truly collaborate to create a more equitable and inclusive environment. Through critical anti-racist work with Fortune 500 companies, top-raking diverse administrators and alumni, we've garnered some expert tips and best practices that we'd like to share. Our panelists collectively have a wealth of experience that spans the following disciplines: Psychology, Human Resources, Title IX, DEI Strategy and Finance. We invite all participants to join us as we work together to build the bridges that will end the racial divide in our community, and society at large. |
