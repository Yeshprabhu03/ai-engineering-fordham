The MAGIS award is based, first and foremost, on academic performance as measured by GPA—but it also requires students to be engaged in the Gabelli School of Business community by participating in student clubs, assisting at admissions events or any of the innumerable opportunities that are available to get involved. The number of awards presented is based upon the total number of students in each primary concentration and how many deserving candidates there are in a particular year.
