Terri Kershaw Buck is a veteran of the United States Navy, who has over 21 years of both active duty and civilian military experience. She pursued a professional path in positions of increasing responsibility in military related jobs, working for the Naval Sea Systems Command; the Defense Technical Information Center; the Defense Intelligence Agency while on active duty; and at Synchon, LLC after she retired. She currently serves as an ethics counselor in the U.S. Department of the Interior, where she researches and interprets government ethics related laws, regulations, guidelines, and oversight to ensure ethical standards and compliance with regulations are upheld, including those involving financial disclosure. As her career advanced, she has strived to gain the business knowledge and leadership skills required to continue her professional ascent by enrolling in the Executive M.B.A. program at the Gabelli School. She immediately connected with the School’s focus on having an ethical impact on business, as well as the ability to earn her degree by studying in New York City, just one weekend a month. The knowledge and skills she gained have been immediately applicable in her current role. Her experience also has solidified what she already knew about being a strong leader: that building capacity must be complemented by personal growth, and that you must understand the needs and strengths of the people whom you lead to make a lasting difference and inspire meaningful change at any level in government and beyond.

As a combat veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan) and Operation Iraqi Freedom, he honed his skills in weather forecasting, and aviation weather support and intelligence in diverse and challenging environments—both domestically and abroad.

Anuar Romero is a United States Marine Corps veteran with 20+ years of service who, in 2020, had reached a crossroads in his personal and professional life. He decided to pursue a civilian career in the corporate world, parlaying his experience in logistics with the Marines into a role managing a logistics facility for Amazon. Knowing that he wanted to augment what he was learning in this new position, he decided to pursue an Executive M.B.A. at Fordham’s Gabelli School of Business to build upon his strengths as a former leader in the military and in the management career path he chose to take, by acquiring the knowledge he needed to grow and thrive as a corporate executive. Besides being attracted to the EMBA’s leadership focus, Romero appreciated the Gabelli School’s deep commitment to preparing the next generation of business professionals to become changemakers who could really make a difference, as well as its emphasis on sustainable business. Throughout his studies, he was able to connect the strengths he gained as a military officer—leadership, perseverance, and organization—to the knowledge and skills he was acquiring in the classroom. He also was deeply inspired by a study abroad experience to El Camino Ignaciano in Spain. Today, in his role as general manager at Xylem, a leading water technology company committed to “solving water” by creating innovative and smart technology solutions to meet the world’s water, wastewater, and energy needs, he is helping New York City respond to water emergencies in new and innovative ways.
