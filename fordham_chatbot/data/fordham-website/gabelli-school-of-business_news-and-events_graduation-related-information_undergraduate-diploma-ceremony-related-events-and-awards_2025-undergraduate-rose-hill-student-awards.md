# 2025 Undergraduate Rose Hill Student Awards

Each year, the Gabelli School of Business recognizes undergraduate students at the Rose Hill campus for their academic achievements, service to the Gabelli School, and commitment to leveraging business as a way to move society forward and create lasting, positive change. We extend our congratulations to those being acknowledged this year.

**Valedictorians**

The following students have the highest cumulative grade point average of all Gabelli School of Business Rose Hill students, yet their achievements go far beyond the academic excellence they have attained. Hear more about their transformative learning journeys and the ways in which these outstanding students leveraged what they learned to create positive change and have a meaningful impact.
