# Collaborative Programming

## At Your Service

Part of the advantage of attending a major research university is the plethora of resources available to you. In addition to the outstanding education you will receive and the comprehensive academic advising services at your fingertips, you’ll have access to Gabelli School of Business *and* Fordham University resources that supplement your learning, enhance your experience, and provide invaluable support for your well-being.

### Before You Begin…



Graduate Student Ambassador Program

Choosing which college or university to attend to earn your degree can seem like a daunting decision. Sometimes it is best to hear directly from a current student who is already immersed in classroom learning and the wealth of activities we provide to gain a deeper perspective of what your Gabelli School experience will be like. Our Graduate Student Ambassador Program offers an insider’s view of life and learning at the Lincoln Center campus. To visit and/or to speak with a student ambassador, contact the Graduate Admissions Office.

#### Preparatory Programs

As a nationally ranked U.S. business school, we attract students from across the country and around the world. To ensure they are prepared for the rigorous curricula we offer and that they are able to take full advantage of the transformational learning experience we provide, several preparatory programs are available, which allow students to acclimate—from cultural immersion and English language learning to offerings that afford a taste of what graduate study entails.
