## Here to Help Your Acclimate

Leaving home to earn a degree in another country can be exciting but unsettling. Will you make friends, be able to complete the work assigned, converse effectively, and navigate a city the size of New York? These questions and concerns are natural, but they shouldn’t stop you from pursuing your graduate education or your dreams here at the Gabelli School.

As an international student, when you enroll in any of our degree programs you become part of a close-knit community that truly cares. We are here to help you transition to this new environment and make you feel at home.
