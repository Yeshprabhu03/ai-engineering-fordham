# Accounting Careers

**Accounting is the foundation of all business.** In understanding how a business runs and operates, you position yourself to:

- Develop business acumen that is sought out and rewarded
- Be upwardly mobile
- Make valuable contributions to any industry
- Work in any country around the world
- Become recognized as a licensed professional and advisor

**What are the benefits of becoming a CPA?**

- A dynamic career. 90% of CPAs indicate that one-third or less of their roles involve traditional accounting and financial reporting. They spend much more time on issues of information technology, risk management, organizational strategy, supply-chain management, human resources, and supporting the CEO and other managers. [Source:
[www.cpasuccess.com](http://www.cpasuccess.com)] - Opportunities. Employment of accountants and auditors is projected to grow 7 percent from 2020 to 2030, about as fast as the average for all occupations.
- Reward. CPAs earn an average of 10% to 15% more than their non-licensed peers.

**How do you seek CPA licensure?**

Licensure requirements vary by state. To begin, you will need to determine in which state you will seek licensure. Then you must work to achieve those requirements. A website called [This Way to CPA](https://www.thiswaytocpa.com/exam-licensure/cpa-exam-licensure-center) is a valuable resource for licensure information.

Students should use [RamCentral](/information-technology/it-services/ramcentral360/) to schedule one-on-one advising sessions to discuss career path options in accounting including CP licensure with the Accounting and Taxation career advisor:

Is accounting right for me?

Your Gabelli School advisors—academic and career—can help you to contemplate this question. If you are considering accounting as a career, we recommend that you connect first with your class dean. Once you’ve spoken with your class dean and maybe an accounting faculty member who has taught you in class, make an appointment on [RamCentral](/information-technology/it-services/ramcentral360/) or an individual career advising appointment.
