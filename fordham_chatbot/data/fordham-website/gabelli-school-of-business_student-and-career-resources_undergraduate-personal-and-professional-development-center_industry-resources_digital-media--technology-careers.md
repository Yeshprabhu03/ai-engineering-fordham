# Digital Media & Technology Careers

Digital Media & Technology undergraduates at the Gabelli School have access to career advisors who specialize in the recruiting process for internships and full-time jobs in their field.

PPD Digital Media & Technology advisors hold individual meetings with students, organize career-search skills workshops, work directly with faculty, and establish direct connections with media and technology companies that are interested in hiring Fordham students. You can make an appointment with a PPD Marketing Advisor on [RamCentral](/information-technology/it-services/ramcentral360/).

## Individual career advising

One-on-one advising sessions are available to digital media & technology students. At these sessions, you will receive assistance with:

- Typical career paths for media track and technology track students

Part of the digital media & technology career-advising process is choosing a career path in either technology or media. Your advisor will work together with you to craft a professional-development plan that is best-suited to your interests and strengths. Digital media is the future. A career in digital media can not only mean working for a large media company but also designing and developing content for company’s digital marketing initiatives or websites. Some examples of careers in digital media are:

- Social media strategist
- Account coordinator at a media company
- Device marketing specialist
- Web analytics specialist

A career where technology and marketing intersect often entails designing and developing content for marketing initiatives, websites, video games or animation. Some examples of careers in technology are:

**Digital media and technology career workshops and events**

A great way to learn more about digital media & technology careers, make connections with companies, and broaden your network—all at the same time—is through the events offered by the Personal and Professional Development Center.

**Young Alumni Panels**

Young Alumni Panels are very much like they sound: Current students have a chance to hear from a panel of one or more recent Fordham alumni who work in digital media & technology careers. Alumni typically are one to three years post-graduation, and they are ideally equipped to speak about what entry-level jobs in digital media & technology are like.

You will hear about actual projects that young alumni are working on, helping you to envision your first year or two of work. Most importantly, you will have the chance to ask questions of Fordham graduates who want to help you—and who have the real-world experience to give you the best answers.

Recent alumni participants work for companies such as NBCUniversal, CNN, Pinterest, TikTok, LinkedIn, Visa, American Express, Amazon, and Google.

**Mock Interview Week**

You want to be as prepared as possible when you walk into an interview—whether for an internship or a job. At PPD mock interview sessions, you may practice fielding questions from a career advisor, an industry recruiter, a Fordham alumnus or alumna, or an industry professional who wants to come to campus to help out. No matter who your practice interviewer may be, you will walk away with a better sense of your areas of strength and needs for improvement.

**Career-search skills workshops**

PPD offers career workshops every semester that can aid you in your professional development. Dates will be posted on the [GabelliConnect calendar](http://www.gabelliconnect.com/calendar).
