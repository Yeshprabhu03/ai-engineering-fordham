# Undergraduate Services at Lincoln Center

## PPD for Lincoln Center’s three concentrations

Personal and Professional Development at Lincoln Center is tailored for the three specialized concentrations available to students pursuing the Bachelor of Science in Global Business.

### Group workshops and events

**Spotlight Series**

This series features small-group lectures about job functions and industries—a great way to learn about the breadth of career opportunities that awaits you as an eventual Gabelli School graduate. Still, deciding which career path interests you? These events can help you narrow it down. Recent career topics have included:

- Investment Banking
- Investment Management
- Equity Research
- Sales and trading
- Consulting Careers (with PwC)
- Consumer Products Brand Management (with L’Oreal)
- Entertainment Marketing (with NBCUniversal and AMCNetworks)
- Account Management in Advertising (with Publicis)

**Career-search Skills Workshops**

Looking for an internship or job is a skill in itself. To ensure you are prepared, the PPD team runs frequent workshops that develop your abilities to make an impression on employers. Examples of this type of programming include:

- How a Recruiter Looks at your Résumé
- Getting Ready for Employer Presentations or Career Fairs
- Interviewing Preparation
- Crafting and Telling Your Story
- How to Have a Successful Internship

### One-on-one Counseling Appointments

Our career advisors have worked in the field, many in corporate recruiting. They understand better than anyone what the recruiters on the other side of the table from you will be looking for.
- Through group workshops and individual career-advising appointments, you will have access to people who understand the worlds of accounting, finance, digital media and technology, information systems / IT, management, and marketing and consumer insights—and who can help you to find your place there.

Our [career advisors](/gabelli-school-of-business/student-and-career-resources/undergraduate-personal-and-professional-development-center/ppd-team/) make their schedules public on The Fordham Hub, where you can log in with your Fordham username and password to pre-book an appointment.
