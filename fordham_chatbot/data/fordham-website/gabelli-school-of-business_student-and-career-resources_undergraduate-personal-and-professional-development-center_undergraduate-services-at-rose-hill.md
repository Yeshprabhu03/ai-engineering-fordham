# Undergraduate Services at Rose Hill

## How can the Personal and Professional Development Center help you?

PPD offers a wide array of services for Gabelli School undergraduates. We designed these offerings based on feedback from employers and industry experts, as well as students themselves.

### Group workshops and events

**Spotlight Series**

This series features small-group lectures about job functions and industries—a great way to learn about the breadth of career opportunities that awaits you as an eventual Gabelli School graduate. Still deciding which career path interests you? These events can help you narrow it down. Recent topics have included:

- Investment Banking
- Investment Management
- Equity Research
- Accounting specialties
- Marketing

**Career-search skills workshops**

Looking for an internship or job is a skill unto itself. To ensure you are prepared, the Personal and Professional Development team runs frequent workshops that develop your abilities to make an impression on employers. Examples of this type of programming include:

- How a Recruiter Looks at your Résumé
- Getting Ready for Employer Presentations or Career Fairs
- Networking and Informational Meetings
- Interviewing Preparation
- Crafting and Telling Your Story

Interested in attending a Spotlight Series event or a workshop? All PPD workshops are posted on the [GabelliConnect calendar](http://www.gabelliconnect.com/calendar). Visit the calendar and browse specific listings to sign up.

### One-on-one counseling appointments

Serving you as an individual student is important to us. To that end, Personal and Professional Development offer one-on-one access to our team members, who are capable of advising you generally (if you are not yet sure of your career goal) or in a specific way based on industry (if you have a target career in mind, such as within accounting, finance, marketing, or analytics). You can access an individual meeting in one of two ways:

**Walk-in Advising**

“Talk to Us Tuesdays” are our way of making Personal and Professional Development available to students even when planning isn’t possible. We offer walk-in hours from 2 pm to 3 pm every Tuesday in the PPD suite, which is located on the third floor of Hughes Hall, room 300B (to the left when you emerge from the elevator).

**Scheduled Appointments**

Our [career advisors](/gabelli-school-of-business/student-and-career-resources/undergraduate-personal-and-professional-development-center/ppd-team/) make their schedules public on The Fordham Hub, where you can log in with your Fordham username and password to pre-book an appointment.

### Interviewing practice

Personal and Professional Development arranges a Mock Interview Week that offers five full days of time slots for interview practice. Between the PPD staff and outside volunteers, interviewers are available with expertise in accounting, general management, information systems, investment banking, marketing, and alternative investments. Time slots are first-come, first-served, with preference given to juniors and seniors who are about to head into the most crucial times for internship and job interviews. The PPD team sends out an email each fall with instructions on how to sign up.

At any other time, individual career advisors can arrange a mock interview to suit your needs. Please schedule a one-on-one meeting to discuss the interview you have coming up, and an advisor will put together a plan to help you. Learn about your one-on-one meeting options in the section above.

### Field-specific Advising and Coaching

Among the premier advantages that Personal and Professional Development offers to Gabelli School students is industry knowledge. Our career advisors have worked in the field, many in corporate recruiting. They understand better than anyone what the recruiters on the other side of the table from you will be looking for.

Through both group workshops and individual career-advising appointments, you will have access to people who understand the worlds of accounting, finance, information systems / IT, management, and marketing—and who can help you to find your place there.
