# Evening Student Advising

The evening program at the Gabelli School of Business is for non-traditional students. It affords students who are working full-time to return to school and complete a Bachelor of Science degree.

The advantage to the evening program is that students have one person to advise them throughout their entire course of study. These students face many challenges in balancing work, family and school. They are encouraged to attend workshops on time management, understanding their strengths and weaknesses, and assessing their transferable skills.
