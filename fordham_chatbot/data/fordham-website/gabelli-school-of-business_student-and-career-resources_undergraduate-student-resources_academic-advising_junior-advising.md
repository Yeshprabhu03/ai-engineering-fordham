# Junior Advising

## Connecting

As freshmen and sophomores, you focused on exploring and discerning to determine the intersection of your interests and aptitudes. As juniors, you will be actualizing the fruits of your exploration and connecting with industries, concepts, networks, and resources to ensure you are on the right personal and professional path. For those of you who are sure of your path, you’ve made plans and now you get to execute them! For those of you who feel uncertain, there is still time to discover your passion!

Junior year focuses on the Jesuit principle of “magis”: doing and being more. In addition to Integrated Project 3: Business Modeling and your major classes, you might be a freshman orientation mentor, start a new business, hold an internship with a great company, compete in a case competition, participate in service learning, or study abroad to experience a new culture.

### Myriad Opportunities

Extracurricular opportunities abound on and off campus, and we encourage you to take advantage of all that the Fordham community has to offer. If you have not already done so, join a student club. Check out the events calendar and attend a corporate presentation and/or career networking event. Make an appointment with the Personal and Professional Development (PPD) center to update your résumé and hone your interviewing skills. And meet with your class dean to make sure you are on the path for graduation.
