# Junior Registration: Basics

## Your Academic Program

Every student must complete a total of 40 courses. Most courses will be 3 credits, but some will be two 1.5-credit classes paired together to equal one course. This degree plan is broken down into 26 core courses (liberal arts and business) and 14 electives (majors, concentrations, minors, and liberal arts electives).

Gabelli School juniors should plan to register for some core and major/concentration/minor electives PLUS the one-credit Integrated Project: Analytics course. The standard schedule is five full classes plus one IP course (approximately 16 credits, depending upon the full courses chosen, as some Fordham College classes are 4 credits rather than 3). My advice is to balance your schedule so that you complete some liberal arts core, some Gabelli School business core, and some major/concentration/minor electives. You should take some courses for your concentration/major but also consider that the core you put off today, you must complete tomorrow. Don’t leave all of your core until senior year!

Registration is based upon earned credits. This means that classes currently in progress do not count toward the credit thresholds for registration. Students can view their earned credits on DegreeWorks via My Apps tab at the top of your screen (desktop view) or the hamburger menu icon (tablet/mobile view).

### Transfer Students

Transfer students should confirm that all of their pending transfer credits have been added to their Fordham records prior to the start of registration. Often, a transfer student sends an initial transcript for his or her transfer application that includes “in progress” classes from another school. Students must remember to submit a second, final transcript once grades have been confirmed for those classes in order to earn transfer credit for those classes.

### Dealing with Holds

Your student account must be in good standing on the first day of registration. You can double check if there are any holds on your account in Banner Self-Service and/or DegreeWorks. If there is a hold, please follow the instructions of the hold to contact the appropriate person and make arrangements to remove it. Pending financial obligations must be taken care of prior to registration, or else the hold will prevent any schedule updates.

### Study Abroad Classes

Students who plan to study abroad should make sure to meet with their class dean to confirm the classes they will be taking abroad and on campus during the academic year. Planning is crucial when incorporating an international experience into your Gabelli School degree program.

### Liberal Arts Core

Liberal arts core classes are meant to be completed through your school and campus of enrollment. As such, full-time Gabelli School students should take liberal arts core courses on the Rose Hill campus during the day. Also, remember that both Gabelli School and Fordham College students must complete many of the same liberal arts core classes. As such, each section of those classes is divided in half, so that students from both schools have a chance to access them during the initial registration period. Finally, while some liberal arts core courses are the same for Gabelli School and Fordham College students, others are not: Gabelli School students are not required to complete foreign language, natural science, or any Eloquentia Perfecta courses (except English Texts & Contexts as all sections are marked EP2).

### Business Core

In addition to the integrated business core classes, Gabelli School students must also complete three additional (non-integrated) business core classes: Legal Frameworks of Business, Operations and Production Management, and Ethics in Business.

### Majors, Minors, Concentrations, and Electives

Major, minor, and concentration courses are determined by the unique combination of credentials chosen by each student. Please review the registration tips by subject section below for more details.

Non-major, minor, or concentration electives are labeled as business electives, liberal arts electives, or free electives. A business elective is any course offered by the Gabelli School. A liberal arts elective is any course offered by Fordham College. A free elective can be any course offered by either the Gabelli School or Fordham College.

### Globalism Requirement

All Gabelli School students have a one-course globalism requirement as part of their bachelor’s degree programs. Any course that fulfills this requirement will have the “Globalism - GLBB” attribute listed in Banner. There are classes within each business discipline so that students can fulfill the globalism requirement while completing their majors or concentrations.

### Pass/Fail

Designating a course Pass/Fail means that regardless of the actual final letter grade, the student will earn a grade of “P” for a passing grade and “F” for a failing grade. Pass/Fail is meant to encourage students to try something challenging without the worry of a possible bad grade. Students may take **one course per academic year** Pass/Fail, as long as it does not count toward a core, major, minor, or concentration requirement.

### Verify Your Degree Plan

All students should review DegreeWorks prior to registration to verify the core and elective courses they have left to complete, as well as the requirements for their major, minor, and/or concentration.

If at any point your degree plan needs to be updated, you should (1) meet with your class dean, and (2) use the “what if” feature in DegreeWorks to see what requirements you still have to complete based upon your desired degree plan. *Make sure to pick your school* in addition to your major/concentration/minor when using the “what if” feature.
