# Senior Advising

Dear Gabelli School Seniors,

As you embark on this special journey - your senior year - the Dean's Office encourages you to stay in contact throughout the year, connect with each other inside and outside of the classroom, and be excited for what’s to come. It is especially important that you monitor your Degree Works to ensure that you are fulfilling your graduation requirements. Also, please continue to utilize the [undergraduate student services](/gabelli-school-of-business/student-and-career-resources/undergraduate-student-resources/) that are available to you as a Fordham and Gabelli student.
