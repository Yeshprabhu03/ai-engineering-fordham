# Sophomore Advising: Choosing Your Major

## Requirements:

Every sophomore must complete 40 full courses in order to graduate. Twenty-six of these consist of your liberal arts and business core requirements. (Four of those courses are split into half-courses.) The remaining 14 classes must be used to fulfill your chosen major or concentration. Please keep in mind that each degree option has its own particular curriculum of required courses. You can see them all using the "What If?" function of your DegreeWorks, found in the My Apps tab under My Apps tab at the top of your screen (desktop view) or the hamburger menu icon (tablet/mobile view).

**TIPS FOR REGISTERING FOR FALL OF JUNIOR YEAR:**

**If you are an accounting major**, you need to take Intermediate Financial Accounting 1 (ACBU 3434). We recommend you also take Individual and Business Taxation (ACBU 3442).

**If you are a finance major**, you should take Corporate Financial Policy (FNBU 3440) and Investments and Securities Analysis (FNBU 3441). If you would like to complete the secondary concentration in value investing, you must complete Intro to Value Investing (FNBU 4457).

**If you are a marketing major**, you should take Marketing Research (MKBU 3441) and Consumer Behavior (MKBU 3435) or another upper-level marketing course.

**If you are a business administration major**, you should take at least one course in your intended primary concentration. (For example, any of the above courses recommended for majors would be appropriate.)
