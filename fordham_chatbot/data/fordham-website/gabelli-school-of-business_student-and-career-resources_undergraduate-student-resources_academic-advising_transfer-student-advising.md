# Transfer Student Advising

Transfer advising is designed to help newly accepted external transfer students make a smooth transition from their prior institution to Fordham’s Gabelli School of Business. The focus of the program is to help transfer students gain a strong foundational understanding of the university, the Gabelli School, and their programs, structures, systems and opportunities.

The formal part of transfer advising consists of a pre-orientation session that is typically scheduled for the week prior to the start of school; the formal university orientation program, which begins three days before school begins for fall admits and during the first week of school for spring admits; one-on-one advising sessions prior to the start of school and during the first month of school; and the Gabelli School of Business Transfer Advising Course, which is scheduled for the first month and a half of the semester.

The Gabelli School of Business Transfer Advising Course is required of all new external Fordham Gabelli transfer students. It provides students with an opportunity to:

- Better understand Fordham University and the Gabelli School of Business.
- Better understand the academic opportunities available — curriculum, programs, areas of study, study abroad and more.
- Better understand the pre-professional, personal, and spiritual opportunities available at the university.
