## Beta Alpha Psi: Membership information

**Minimum Membership Requirements:**

- Members are required to attend all meetings throughout the semester.
- Students are to actively participate in firm events.
- Students are to actively participate in community-service events and are required to do a minimum of 6 community-service hours per semester.
- Students who have internships on Mondays or who will be abroad for a semester are responsible to inform the reporting secretary, who will place them "on leave."

*Please note that these are minimum requirements, and members are expected to perform above these standards. A points system gauges how active or inactive a member is throughout the year. *

During the application/pledge semester, candidates for membership are expected to be actively involved according to the requirements above. Candidates also will receive further details during that semester about the membership requirements of the Alpha Omega Chapter. Those who successfully complete the pledge semester will be inducted during the following term.
