**Overview:** The Digital Business Society enables and empowers students to participate in today’s digital economy. Through activities, workshops and other events, the club shows people how technology can work for them, not against them. The Digital Business Society welcomes all students, technical and non-technical, to examine how technology can be put to use in the realm of commerce: to improve business processes, smooth workflow and create opportunities for the future.

By participating in the club, students will develop a competitive advantage in the workforce and learn skills that will serve them in any field: accounting, marketing, finance, IT, management and beyond. They also will get to network with the Fordham Graduate School of Business Administration’s branch of the Digital Business Society and the undergraduate chapter club of the Association for Information Systems.

Activities include:

- Hands-on workshops to enhance your computer skills
- Networking events with professionals from tech startups to multinational firms
- Opportunities outside Fordham to showcase your abilities and ideas
- Co-sponsored events with other Fordham clubs on all fields in business

Fordham offers a comprehensive academic track in exactly the field that the Digital Business Society was designed to embrace. Learn more [here](/gabelli-school-of-business/student-and-career-resources/undergraduate-student-resources/student-organizations/information-systems/).
