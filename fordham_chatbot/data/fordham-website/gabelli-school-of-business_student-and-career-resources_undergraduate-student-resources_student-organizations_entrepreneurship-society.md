**Overview:** Fordham Entrepreneurship is for Fordham’s trail blazers, game changers, and change makers. Whether you are interested in being more entrepreneurially minded, being a part of a startup, or want to start a business of your own, this is the place for you. Students, faculty, and alumni can meet, share resources, and exchange ideas while finding their own entrepreneurial spirit.

Becoming an active part of the club involves attending monthly social events and workshops. Students are also expected to take on leadership roles and to actively participate in ES-sponsored events; to identify speakers and hands-on learning opportunities; to work with administrators, faculty and outside professionals to strengthen the club; and to learn from one another through brainstorming sessions, idea pitches and sharing feedback. The purpose and format of the club enables students to start putting their ideas into action by accessing a wealth of business resources for real-life innovation. Through guest-speaker series, creative hands-on activities, networking events and the development of student-run businesses, the Entrepreneurship Society aims to establish long-lasting, mutually beneficial relationships among students, faculty, student organizations, alumni and local professionals to build sustainable business ventures both on and off campus.

Entrepreneurship is about taking action and embracing successes as well as setbacks. Those looking for an exciting and rewarding career are encouraged to join.

**Special programs**: The Entrepreneurship Society sponsors its own conference - [TrepCon ](https://news.fordham.edu/business-and-economics/trepcon-2020-be-flexible-and-learn-from-failure/)- every year, providing a meeting ground and networking forum for aspiring and current business owners of all ages.
