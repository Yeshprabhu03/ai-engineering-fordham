**Mission statement:** To promote knowledge, provide information, develop networks, be a host to intellectuals and prepare students to develop into ethical and professional members of the financial community.

**Overview:** The Fordham Finance Society accomplishes these goals by organizing informational events, training workshops, alumni meet-and-greets and informal club meetings, and by disseminating information about financial news and events.

By joining the Finance Society, which includes more than 500 members, students have the opportunity to connect with and utilize the resources of peers, faculty, alumni and business professionals to achieve their professional aspirations.

The Fordham Finance Society assists students in preparing for internships and jobs in the finance industry by leveraging the resources of the Gabelli School of Business. The society works closely with the
[Personal and Professional Development Center](/gabelli-school-of-business/student-and-career-resources/undergraduate-personal-and-professional-development-center/) to organize career-building events such as interview-prep seminars and résumé workshops and to expose members to all of the different possibilities that exist in the world of finance.
