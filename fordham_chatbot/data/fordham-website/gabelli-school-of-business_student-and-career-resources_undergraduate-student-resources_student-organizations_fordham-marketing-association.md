**Overview: **Dedicated to promoting the knowledge and appreciation for marketing in the world around us, the Fordham Marketing Association caters to all students who are interested in the fields of marketing, advertising and public relations. We focus on current knowledge of the marketing industry, invite marketing guest speakers to Fordham and conduct professional development workshops. We are a registered collegiate chapter of the American Marketing Association and attend its International Collegiate Conference in New Orleans every year, along with regional events. We put a strong emphasis on building a personal brand and learning to network in this technological age.

**Fun fact:** Fordham Marketing Association won a first place award at the American Marketing Association's Collegiate Conference in 2016 for their creative take on the conference's overall theme.
