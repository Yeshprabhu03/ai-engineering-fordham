**Overview: **

The Fordham LC Undergraduate PEVCC works to Promote a greater understanding of and Provide Undergrad students with the resources to navigate the Venture Capital and Private Equity Industries. With networking being such an important part of ensuring success in business, we hope the club will provide Undergrad students with the chance to network with industry leaders and graduate students involved in the PE and VC industries. We will be hosting events with recognized speakers from the PE/VC worlds along with workshops to help students better understand the fundamentals of PEVC and develop the skills necessary to be successful in the industry.
