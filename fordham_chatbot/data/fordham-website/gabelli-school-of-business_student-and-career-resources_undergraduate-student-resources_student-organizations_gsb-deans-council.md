**Major: **Information Systems**Minors:** Global Business, and Process & Quality Analytics**Hometown: **Lake Forest, IL

My name is Eden Kavanagh and I joined the Undergraduate Dean’s Council when I realized I wanted to become more than a student on campus. The Dean’s Council was a way that I could serve and lead within our business community. I'm passionate about our school and love the opportunity to consistently improve the holistic experience. An added reason why I've stayed with the Dean’s Council is that the students who make up this group are some of the kindest and brightest. Being a member has benefited me greatly as I participate in this community.



Community and Integration Subcommittee

The Community and Integration Subcommittee was recently created by combining the Transfer Subcommittee and the Commuter Subcommittees. It now encompasses all types of students within the Gabelli School—particularly those who have not had the traditional college experience—such as transfer and commuter students. The goal of the Subcommittee is to truly make all students feel welcome each day, and to emphasize the importance of integrating every student into the Gabelli School community in order to enhance the experience for all.

The Community and Integration Subcommittee holds multiple events each semester, including social events that allow students to branch out and meet new people, and panel discussions that provide students who haven't had traditional college experiences, to offer their advice on how to take advantage of all of the opportunities the Gabelli School has to offer. Additionally, our committee works behind the scenes with the Office for Student Involvement and with clubs such as CSA, to better structure student clubs and to work to make Fordham University an overall better place for commuters and transfer students. We are so excited to see what the future holds for the Community and Integration subcommittee!

**Paige Barcus **– Co-head, Community and Integration Subcommittee

**Major: **Finance**Hometown: **West Chester, PA

After transferring to the Gabelli School during the first semester of my sophomore year, I was really looking for a community in which I could actively get involved, while simultaneously working to better the School. The Undergraduate Dean's Council was, and is, this community for me. I felt as though being on the Dean's Council would help me grow as a person and allow me to make a positive impact on those students—such as transfers and commuters—who haven't had a traditional college experience. My time thus far on the Council has been wonderful, and being subcommittee co-head has allowed me to grow my leadership skills and overall involvement in the Gabelli School. I am looking forward to my final year!
