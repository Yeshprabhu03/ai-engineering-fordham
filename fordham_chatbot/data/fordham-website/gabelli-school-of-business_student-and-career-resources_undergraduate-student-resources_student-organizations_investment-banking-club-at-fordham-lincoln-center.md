**Overview**

The Investment Banking Club at Fordham Lincoln Center is a student-run organization that builds a foundation for future financiers and investment bankers. The executive board is comprised of student professionals who have experience at investment banks and understand what it takes to break into Wall Street.

The purpose of IBC is to provide a springboard for students who want to learn more about the industry through guest speakers and several technical workshops. The banking recruiting process is difficult and rigorous, so IBC helps guide students by teaching them a set of skills ranging from networking to valuation.

IBC’s advisor and executive board members interact with students daily in order to connect them with alumni and resources needed for self-learning. This lean and diverse group of students is, therefore, primed, and capable of breaking into the industry.
