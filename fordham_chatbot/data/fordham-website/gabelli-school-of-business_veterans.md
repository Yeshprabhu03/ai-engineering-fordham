The Yellow Ribbon GI Education Enhancement Program, or the Yellow Ribbon Program, is a part of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008. If you choose to pursue earning a degree and your graduate or undergraduate tuition exceeds what the Veterans Administration (VA) can pay, **Fordham’s Yellow Ribbon Program**, along with matching funds from the VA can satisfy paying the difference.

As an approved Yellow Ribbon Program university, Fordham guarantees that **all tuition and fees are fully covered** for admitted veterans, active military, and eligible family members who fall in the VA's maximum benefit category.
