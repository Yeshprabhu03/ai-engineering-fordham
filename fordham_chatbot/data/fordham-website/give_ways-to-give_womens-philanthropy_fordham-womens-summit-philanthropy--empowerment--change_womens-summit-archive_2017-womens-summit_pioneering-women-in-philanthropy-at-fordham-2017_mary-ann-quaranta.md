# Mary Ann Quaranta

**Mary Ann Quaranta, D.S.W. (1926–2009)**, served as dean of Fordham’s Graduate School of Social Service (GSS) for 25 years. During her tenure as dean, she transformed GSS into a nationally recognized school of social work. After her retirement from GSS in 2000, Mary Ann assumed the position of provost at Marymount College and helped merge that undergraduate women’s college with Fordham University.![Mary Quaranta pioneering in philanthropy](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/Mary_Quaranta.jpg)


Dean Quaranta’s leadership extended into the national and global social work arena, where she demonstrated respect for the unique dignity and worth of all people, especially the most vulnerable members of society. Dean Quaranta is honored through a scholarship gift to Fordham University made by her daughter, Mary Beth Morrissey, Ph.D., M.P.H., J.D., and the Morrissey Family.
