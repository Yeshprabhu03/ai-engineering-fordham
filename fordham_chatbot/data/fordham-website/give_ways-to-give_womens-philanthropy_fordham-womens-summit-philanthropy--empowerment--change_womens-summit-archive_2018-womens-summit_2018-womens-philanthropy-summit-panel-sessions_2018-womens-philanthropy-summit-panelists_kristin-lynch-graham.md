Kristin Lynch Graham, FCRH ’92, GSE ’98, ’01

Kristin Lynch Graham is the president of Sacred Heart Academy, an all-girls Catholic high school on Long Island. She is responsible for the overall advancement and strategic direction of the institution, which enrolls approximately 850 students and has more than 11,000 alumnae. She ensures that the future vision for Sacred Heart is consistent with the school’s 70-year history and mission. Graham says she is inspired by this work because of the school’s mission to educate and empower women to “take the lead” with compassion, courage, and commitment.

Graham has an accomplished background in institutional advancement, alumni relations, strategic planning, and communications. Prior to joining Sacred Heart, she served as the director of development for the Schools of St. Mary in Manhasset, New York. She had a 10-year career at Fordham University in the Office of Development and University Relations, where she was the first woman to be appointed as the director of alumni relations, and later served as the assistant vice president for alumni relations and annual giving. In 2005, she became the director of leadership gifts at Columbia Law School, where she was responsible for creating the strategic plan for a $300 million campaign.

She holds a bachelor’s degree (1992) and a master’s degree (1996) in English literature and a master’s in education (2001) from Fordham University. She recently completed an executive leadership program run by the Mendoza College of Business at the University of Notre Dame.

She and her husband, Chris, are the parents of two daughters: Cecilia, 11, and Lauren, 9. They reside in Port Washington, New York.
