Debra Toppeta

Her husband, Bill, is a 1970 graduate of Fordham College at Rose Hill and a Fordham Trustee Fellow. Debra and Bill are both members of the Archbishop Hughes Society. They have three daughters, including Kristin, a 2013 graduate of Fordham Law School.

Together, Debra and Bill have been devoted supporters of education in New York City, particularly of LaGuardia Community College and Fordham University.

Bill serves on the LaGuardia board of trustees, and the couple helps sponsor activities for the school’s President’s Society students. Each year, the LaGuardia Community College Toppeta Scholarship supports one LaGuardia graduate who enrolls at Fordham.

Also at Fordham, the couple established both the Toppeta Family Chair in Global Financial Markets and the John and Rita Toppeta Endowed Scholarship Fund, which honors Bill’s parents—also Fordham alumni.

For their joint thoughtful, passionate leadership and cherished stewardship of Fordham, they were honored with the 2015 Fordham Founder’s Award.
