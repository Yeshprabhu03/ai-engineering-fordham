Sister Monica made the decision to pursue her master’s degree in Biology and was accepted into Fordham’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences program, where she obtained her degree in 1961. Sister Monica continued her studies in the field of Biology and earned a doctoral degree in 1964.

With her doctorate, Sister Monica went on to work at St. John’s University as a member of their faculty. Three short years later, she returned to Fordham to work for the Biology Department as a researcher, teacher, and mentor to doctoral students. She also directed the Pre-Med/Health Program. Through her forty years at Fordham, Sister Monica served on a multitude of College and University Committees. She was appointed to the Faculty Senate and was voted in as President in 1977 until 1980. Sister Monica was intrigued by the sport of basketball and, many times, you would find her in gym stands supporting her favorite Fordham basketball team. This led her to become the first woman to serve on the Athletic Advisory Board. In 1986 Sister Monica undertook the role of Dean of the newly centralized Summer session which she organized and administered for 12 years.
