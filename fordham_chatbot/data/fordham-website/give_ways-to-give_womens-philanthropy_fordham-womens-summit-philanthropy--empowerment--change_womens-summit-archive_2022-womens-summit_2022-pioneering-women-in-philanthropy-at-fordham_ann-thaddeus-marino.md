A native of New York City, Ann Thaddeus Marino, R.S.H.M., grew up in the Bronx and graduated from Marymount College in Tarrytown in 1963. Sister Marino was professed as a Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary in 1957, and since then she’s taught in schools owned and staffed by the R.S.H.M. in New York, as well as abroad in Colombia, Spain, and Italy.

In 1982, Sister Marino went to Cormaria Retreat House, transforming it into one of the first retreat houses to welcome people suffering from AIDS and HIV and offering new programming for women and people in 12-step recovery programs. Over the ensuing 40 years, she has guided countless retreats, as well as collaborated with Jesuit retreat houses in California; Wernersville, Pennsylvania; and Rhode Island. “I am a spiritual director to many people from all walks of life,” Sister Marino said. “I find that people in today’s world of chaos are looking for a haven of peace and tranquility. I’d like to think they find it at Cormaria.”

Sister Marino also has created two hermitages where people can go to pray and reflect, hosted days of reflection for young mothers and cancer survivors, and hosted workshops on spirituality.
