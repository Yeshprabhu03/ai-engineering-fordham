After graduating from Fordham University in 1988 with a degree in accounting, Joy Fernandez began her career at EY in the entrepreneurial services group. Once her children were born, she adopted a flexible work arrangement—and it didn’t stand in the way of her making partner in 2003: Fernandez was the Long Island office managing partner for five years before transitioning into her U.S. East regional independence leader role.

Her journey has included numerous EY initiatives, including serving as co-chair of the New York office’s first Women’s Leadership Conference; launching Women’s Executives Connect (WEConnect), a forum for women executives; serving as co-chair of the Tri-State Professional Women’s Network and a member of the inclusiveness and diversity councils; and fostering an environment of flexibility and flexible work arrangements.

Outside of EY, Fernandez has been a board member of the Long Island Association, where she co-launched and co-chaired the Women’s Collaborative, as well as an early member of the advisory board that launched a Girls Inc. of Long Island affiliate. She is active in her church, including teaching Sunday school, leading vacation Bible school, and co-chairing the finance committee.
