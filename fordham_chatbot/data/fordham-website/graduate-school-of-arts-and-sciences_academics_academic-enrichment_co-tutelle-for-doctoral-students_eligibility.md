# Co-tutelle Eligibility

To be eligible to propose a Co-tutelle arrangement, a doctoral student must:

- be in good academic standing with GSAS;
- have completed successfully the entirety of preparatory required coursework for the doctoral program of study; and
- have passed the program’s language examination, comprehensive examination, and defended successfully the doctoral dissertation prospectus.

A doctoral student who is approved to participate in a GSAS-funded Co-tutelle agreement and who meets the standards of Satisfactory Academic Performance and Progress as described in §7.4.1 and §7.4.2 of the [GSAS Academic Policies and Procedures Guidebook](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/gsas/resources/handbook/) may be eligible to continue the GSAS merit-based financial aid for up to one academic year.

Any GSAS merit-based financial aid utilized during the doctoral student’s residency at the Co-tutelle institution shall be considered as forming part of the original GSAS financial aid award package and shall not exceed the equivalent of one academic year of GSAS financial aid in total.

Entry into an approved, GSAS-funded Co-tutelle arrangement shall not create additional financial aid award obligations on the part of GSAS or extend the number of years of GSAS financial aid available to the doctoral student, beyond those specified in the doctoral student's original financial aid award package.

A doctoral student who is approved to participate in a GSAS-funded Co-tutelle agreement agrees to fulfill all terms and conditions of GSAS merit-based financial aid. All financial aid implications resulting from entry into a GSAS-funded Co-tutelle arrangement should be addressed in the doctoral student’s plan of study and research.

If a doctoral student is unable to meet all terms and conditions of a GSAS merit-based financial aid award while in residency at the Co-tutelle partner institution, that financial aid award year, in its entirety, may need to be deferred. Renewal and continuation of GSAS merit-based financial aid are contingent on meeting the standards of Satisfactory Academic Performance and Progress as described in §7.4.1 and §7.4.2 of the [GSAS Academic Policies and Procedures Guidebook](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/gsas/resources/handbook/), and are subject to the terms of the original GSAS financial aid award.

Any additional required coursework specified by the Co-tutelle partner institution requiring completion when the doctoral student is in residence at that institution must be included in the plan of study and research, with all tuition and fees being borne by the doctoral student.

**Please note:** **Eligible Co-tutelle partner institutions may only be those institutions that are not presently accredited in the United States.**
