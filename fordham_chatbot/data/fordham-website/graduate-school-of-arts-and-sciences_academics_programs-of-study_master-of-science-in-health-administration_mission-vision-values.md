# M.S. in Health Administration Mission, Vision, Values

## Mission

The M.S. in Health Administration (MSHA) program at Fordham University, guided by Jesuit principles and industry-based faculty, addresses healthcare in an interdisciplinary model to ensure early to mid-careerists are prepared to assume healthcare leadership roles and lead change across the spectrum of healthcare.

## Vision

MSHA degree program at Fordham University will produce graduates who have mastered foundational, theoretical and practical knowledge of contemporary United States health care systems which will enable them to serve as highly informed ethical leaders and innovators who lead with sound patient-centered decisions.

## Value

As part of one of the nation's leading Jesuit Universities, our MSHA degree program subscribes to the core value of "*Cura Personalis*" (meaning "care of the whole person"). This drives the MSHA program to develop the mind, body and spirit of our students and exemplifies how our future health care leaders will serve patients and greater communities consistent with and supportive of our Vision.
