# GSAS Admissions FAQ

## Application requirements and policies

-
We welcome applicants from all academic and professional backgrounds who have completed or will be completing an undergraduate degree before enrollment in GSAS. However, individual program requirements vary and you should review specific program requirements on their

[program websites](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/academics/programs-of-study/). -
You must hold an undergraduate degree (U.S. baccalaureate or equivalent) from an accredited institution before enrollment. For international students, if you have a three-year bachelor's degree from a

[member institution](https://ehea.info/page-full_members)within the[Bologna Process](http://www.ehea.info/), you are eligible to apply to GSAS programs. If your institution is not part of this organization, you will need to provide GSAS Admissions with an official course-by-course evaluation of your higher education history by an international credential evaluation company that is a member of[NACES (National Association of Credential Evaluation Services)](https://www.naces.org/)or[AICE (Association of International Credential Evaluators)](https://aice-eval.org/). See[International Students](#intlstudents)below for more information. -
While it is possible to submit applications to more than one GSAS program and receive separate admission decisions, we strongly encourage prospective students to focus on the program that most closely aligns with their career goals and interests. GSAS students may enroll in only one graduate program at a time, except in cases where a specific joint or dual degree option is available (e.g. the

[Dual MA/MS Degree in Economics and Data Science](/academics/departments/computer-and-information-science/academic-programs/graduate-programs/master-of-science-in-data-science/dual-mams-degree-in-economics-and-data-science/)).If you are admitted to more than one GSAS program, you will need to select a single program for enrollment, as enrolling in more than one program at a time is not permitted.

You may also choose to apply to programs across different

[Fordham graduate schools](/academics/colleges-and-schools/graduate-schools/). However, please note that we cannot share application materials between schools, so you must fulfill each school’s application requirements separately.Under certain circumstances, a student may be enrolled in a

[GSAS Advanced Certificate](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/academics/programs-of-study/#d.en.111763)program while being simultaneously matriculated in a degree program. Any exceptions to this policy must be approved in writing by the dean.

-
Yes, there is a non-refundable $85 application fee.

-
After you have submitted your application, you will be prompted via email to make the application fee payment through your Application Status Page.

-
Some applicants may be eligible for a waiver of the application fee. Please review the

[Application Fee Waivers](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/admissions/how-to-apply/application-fee-waivers/)page for detailed information on eligibility and how to request a fee waiver.

-
Deadlines to submit applications vary by program. See our

[application deadlines](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/admissions/how-to-apply/application-deadlines/). -
We strongly encourage international applicants outside the U.S. to submit their completed applications by the program's earliest

[application deadline](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/admissions/how-to-apply/application-deadlines/)to ensure ample time to complete the[student visa application process](/academics/academic-resources/international-services/students/newly-admitted-students/). -
The non-degree application process is very similar to the degree program application process, but there are some differences. Learn more about

[Applying for Non-Degree/Non-Matriculated Classes](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/admissions/non-degree-students/). -
Log into your

[application status page](https://gradadmissions.fordham.edu/account/login)using the same email and password credentials you used to create your application. There you can review your application checklist for any missing documents needed to complete your application.

-
The

[How to Apply](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/admissions/how-to-apply/)page provides a general outline of application materials, but required materials can vary depending on your program of choice. Before applying, please visit the[GSAS Programs of Study](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/academics/programs-of-study/)page and carefully review the specific admissions information/requirements for your chosen degree program. -
To ensure timely review of your application, all of your supporting materials must be received by no later than the published

[application deadline](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/admissions/how-to-apply/application-deadlines/)for your program. We cannot guarantee that your application will be reviewed or considered for admission or possible funding opportunities past the deadline.

-
No, you do not need to submit official transcripts with your application. When you apply, you are required to upload unofficial transcripts from each institution where you earned a bachelor’s or master’s degree, including any institutions where transfer credits counted toward either an undergraduate or graduate-level degree. If you accept an offer of admission from GSAS, you must then submit an official transcript with final grades, title of the degree, and date the degree was conferred from your undergraduate university/college prior to the first day of class.

-
No, we do not require high school transcripts as part of the application.

-
When applying, you are asked to upload an unofficial copy of your transcript. Once you have been admitted, the school requires you to submit a final official transcript, which is sent directly from your prior institution(s) to Fordham University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. If you are an admitted student, log into your

[admitted student portal](https://gradadmissions.fordham.edu/portal/ga_admitted_student)to check if your final official transcript, sent directly from your prior institution, has been received. -
We strongly recommend that all admitted students submit their final official transcripts before the start of the entry term. While it is possible to submit your final transcripts after the semester starts, failure to do so by the course add/drop date listed on the

[GSAS academic calendar](https://go.activecalendar.com/FordhamUniversity/site/academic/?&ql=y&search=y)can lead to a hold on your Fordham student account and may prevent you from registering for classes.

-
Letters of recommendation are letters written to support your application by individuals who can speak to your suitability and potential for success in an advanced degree program. Strong recommendations are crucial to a graduate school application package. When choosing someone to write a recommendation letter, it is best to select someone who knows you well and positively and can speak objectively about your academic abilities and achievements. Educational and professional sources should write recommendations; current or former professors and work supervisors are good options. We suggest that two of your recommendations come from an educational source for applicants completing their undergraduate degree. We discourage letters from relatives and family friends.

-
Requirements vary by program:

- Ph.D.: Three letters
- M.A./M.S./M.T.S.: Three letters (except the M.S. in Health Administration and M.S. in Biotechnology, which requires two)
- Advanced Certificate: Two to three letters
- Accelerated Master’s: Two letters from Fordham faculty

Review the specific admissions information/requirements for your chosen

[Program of Study](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/academics/programs-of-study/). -
All letters of recommendation must be uploaded by the letter provider directly to the GSAS application system. You may not submit your letters of recommendation yourself, and letters

*should NOT*be emailed or submitted on paper by postal mail service. The online application system will prompt you to enter your recommenders contact information (name, title, organization, email, etc.). Once entered, the system will automatically send the individuals an email notification requesting the letter. The recommender will upload their letter directly to the application through a link provided.Please note that you can submit your application even if your letters of recommendation have not yet been submitted. Once the letters are received, they will be added to complete your application. Applicants are able to check the status of the letter’s arrival through the

[application status page](https://gradadmissions.fordham.edu/account/login). -
You should request letters of recommendation early, granting your recommenders at least one month’s notice to submit their recommendations. Once you enter each recommender’s name and email address into the online application, they will receive an email with instructions on how to upload their letter. Submit your application even if your recommendation letters are still in progress.


-
Submission of official GRE scores is optional or not required for some GSAS programs, but required for other programs. Please see

[GSAS Standardized Test Scores for Admissions](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/admissions/how-to-apply/standardized-test-scores-for-admissions/)to determine GRE requirements for your program and details for how to submit official test scores. Fordham’s GRE-ETS school code is 2259. -
Where the GRE is required for admission, GSAS does not accept any other standardized test scores in place of GRE scores.

-
Accepted tests include the TOEFL, IELTS, DET, PTE Academic, or Cambridge English Qualifications. See

[International Students](#intlstudents)for more information.

-
This is a written statement explaining why you would like to attend Fordham and why you would be a good fit for your program of interest. It typically includes how your past experiences make you a good fit for the program, why you are interested in this degree, why you would like to attend Fordham specifically, and how this degree would help you achieve your long-term goals. Some GSAS programs require applicants to answer specific questions as part of their statement. See your

[Program of Study](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/academics/programs-of-study/)Admissions Information/Requirements page for specific information. -
Different from a statement of intent, the optional supplemental essay prompt is a part of the application that offers you an opportunity to discuss specific aspects of your life, experiences, or academic journey that you believe have not been adequately addressed in other parts of your application. It allows you to share any additional essential information with the admissions committee. It's important to note that there is no negative consequence if an applicant chooses not to complete this essay, as it is entirely optional.


-
When applying with academic transcripts from institutions outside the United States, we strongly recommended obtaining a course-by-course credential evaluation. A course-by-course evaluation provides a clear understanding of the U.S. equivalency for courses and grades from colleges and universities outside of the United States. Most applicants provide credential evaluations from

[World Education Services](https://www.wes.org/)or[Educational Credential Evaluators](https://www.ece.org/), but you may use another service that is a member of the[National Association of Credential Evaluation Services](https://www.naces.org/members)(NACES) or[AICE (Association of International Credential Evaluators)](https://aice-eval.org/). Credential evaluations should be uploaded directly to the application along with the original transcript from the issuing institution. Please note that GSAS Admissions reserves the right to require an applicant's credential evaluation, if necessary, to proceed with our admission review process. -
Typically, credential evaluations can be waived if the Bachelor's degree transcript is from a four-year program, is written in English, includes a comprehensive list of completed courses and credits with grades received for each course, and contains an explanatory key that clearly describes the grading and credit system used.

Credential evaluations can be waived provided your transcript includes the following:

- Bachelor's degree from a four-year program
- Written in English
- Includes a comprehensive list of completed courses and credits with grades received for each course
- Contains an explanatory key that clearly describes the grading and credit system used.

Ultimately, whether or not your transcript evaluation requirement is waived will be at the discretion of the Office of Admissions.

-
We urge all admitted students to submit the completed Application for Certificate of Eligibility (AFCOE) and required documents as soon as possible after paying the enrollment deposit and completing the Intent to Enroll process. After you complete your Intent to Enroll, GSAS Admissions will email you specific instructions on submitting your completed AFCOE and supporting documents for the I-20 process. The

[Office of International Services (OIS)](/academics/academic-resources/international-services/)can only process I-20 requests after receiving the completed AFCOE and supporting documents. You can expect to receive your I-20 by email within approximately 2-3 weeks after submitting your AFCOE. See the[OIS Immigration and Visa Information](/academics/academic-resources/international-services/students/newly-admitted-students/immigration-and-visa-information/)page for more details. -
International applicants whose native language is not English must submit official test score results from one of the following accepted English language competency exams: TOEFL, IELTS, DET, PTE Academic, or Cambridge English Qualifications.

Exemptions are generally permitted for international applicants who:

- are native English speakers from countries where English is an official language (

-
If you have a three-year bachelor's degree from a

[member institution](https://ehea.info/page-full_members)within the[Bologna Process](http://www.ehea.info/), you are eligible to apply to GSAS programs. If your institution is not part of this organization, you will need to provide GSAS Admissions with an official evaluation of your higher education history by an international credential evaluation company that is a member of[NACES (National Association of Credential Evaluation Services)](https://www.naces.org/)or[AICE (Association of International Credential Evaluators)](https://aice-eval.org/).If the evaluation indicates that your degree is not equivalent to a U.S. bachelor's degree, GSAS may not be able to offer you admission. However, your application will still be reviewed by the department, the Director of Admissions, and the Dean of GSAS to assess your academic preparedness and strength for admission to the program you are applying for. Please note that you must already have earned a three-year bachelor's degree at the time of application, and the degree should be in a field closely related to the field of study for which you are applying.

If your academic background includes a master's degree, the master's degree should be evaluated along with the three-year degree to determine if the combination is equivalent to a four-year U.S. bachelor's degree.


-
Fall entry term decisions are typically made by late February or early March. Rolling admissions and Spring entry decisions are made within two to three weeks of application completion.

-
While the admissions team cannot comment on whether an individual applicant may be accepted to their program of interest, we can help you understand our admissions process. Applications are reviewed holistically by a program's faculty admissions committee, and the committees make admission recommendations to the Dean of GSAS. The Dean makes all final decisions, and selectivity rates vary by program.

Our holistic admissions process is personalized and thorough. Faculty members make nuanced distinctions among sizable pools of qualified candidates, necessitating a consistent and comprehensive evaluation of each application. Applicants are assessed based on their achievements and potential, taking into consideration the impact of the opportunities and challenges they have encountered. The holistic review process includes consideration of, among other things:

- Academic performance (GPA, individual course grades, standardized test scores, where applicable)
- Research and scholarly potential (research activities, publications, work experience, planning, problem-solving, academic engagement)
- Fortitude and determination to succeed (demonstrated leadership, community services, challenges overcome)

Application evaluations are completed using a combination of quantitative and qualitative measures found throughout a student's application. This holistic approach ensures a comprehensive and fair assessment of each applicant's strengths and potential contributions to the Fordham GSAS community.

-
Yes, the required enrollment deposit payment is currently $587.

Admission is offered with the expectation that students will start in the semester selected during the application process. If your circumstances prevent you from enrolling, you may submit a request to defer your enrollment. Admitted master’s program students may seek permission to defer matriculation for no more than two semesters. Newly admitted Ph.D. program candidates cannot defer their start date. Deferrals require departmental and GSAS dean’s approval. You must complete and submit the Enrollment Deferral Request Form in your admitted student portal to request a deferral.

-
The GSAS does not defer merit-based financial aid awards to another academic term. Financial aid is offered for the entry term to which an applicant applies and is admitted.
