## Admissions guidelines

GSAS welcomes applications from individuals who have earned or will earn, prior to matriculation in a GSAS program, a bachelor’s degree or its equivalent from an accredited institution.

Fordham University admits students of any race, color, national and ethnic origin to all the rights, privileges, programs, and activities generally accorded or made available to students at the school. It does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national and ethnic origin in administration of its educational policies, admissions policies, scholarship and loan programs, and athletic and other school-administered programs.

GSAS utilizes a holistic or “whole file” admissions approach in reviewing applications for matriculation into its degree and advanced certificate programs. This approach helps ensure the consideration of a wide range of applicant qualities, and takes into account a broad base of evidence in rendering admissions decisions.

GSAS reserves the right to require a language proficiency evaluation from any applicant. Requests for exemption from this requirement should be indicated directly within the application. The Fordham English Language Test (FELT), administered by Fordham’s Institute of [American Language and Culture (IALC)](https://t4.fordham.edu/terminalfour/preview/2/en/13539), may be required for those students whose English proficiency scores do not meet GSAS program requirements. Additional coursework may also be recommended by the IALC.

Students are permitted to register for two GSAS courses during the academic term in which they are completing any IALC-recommended coursework, which generally occurs during their first semester of study.

**Please note:** Tuition costs associated with the learning of English as a second language are the responsibility of the student and will not be covered by a GSAS tuition scholarship. GSAS merit-based tuition scholarships are not applicable to the costs of additional coursework recommended by the IALC.
