Alumni Dissertation Fellowships allow students to devote full-time work to their dissertations. Students must complete their dissertation during the fellowship year. Failing to complete the dissertation in the fellowship year will compromise future awards for their department. The Alumni Dissertation Fellowship is the last of the internally administered prestigious awards for advanced doctoral students. Once a student has received an Alumni Dissertation Fellowship, s/he will not be eligible for other GSAS academic year awards (i.e., Graduate Assistantship, Research Assistantship, Teaching Fellowship, Research Fellowship, or Senior Teaching Fellowship). The support will be offered on a competitive basis and will reward students who have already submitted proposals for fellowships, published articles and/or book reviews, presented papers at conferences.

**Award Information**

The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Alumni Dissertation Fellowship provides a 12-month stipend and tuition scholarship. For updated stipend rates, please see [Stipends and Scholarships](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/financial-support/stipends-and-scholarships/).

**Eligibility**

Doctoral students in good standing with satisfactory academic progress according to the guidelines established by Fordham GSAS are eligible for this award. A student may apply for this award only after the department has accepted the proposal and the vice dean has approved the dissertation title and dissertation committee. A student may apply for only **one** of the three academic-year merit awards for advanced students (Research Assistantship, Senior Teaching Fellowship, or Alumni Dissertation Fellowship). Although a student may also apply for a Summer Fellowship, a student cannot simultaneously be awarded a 12-month merit award (i.e., the Alumni Dissertation Fellowship and some of the Research Fellowships) and a Summer Fellowship.

Once granted, the recipient of the award must be certified as full-time and meet satisfactory academic performance and progress requirements. Additionally, the recipient may not hold any other work assignments at the University during the fellowship period, unless granted authorization to do so by the vice dean.
