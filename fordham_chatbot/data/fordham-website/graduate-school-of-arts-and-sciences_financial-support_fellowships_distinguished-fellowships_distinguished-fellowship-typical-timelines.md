* STF may substitute for an RF or ADF in the timeline above * TA, if available**The sample timelines above are not exhaustive.**For example, you could apply to hold an RF in your fourth year if you and your advisor believe you will be a competitive candidate.**You can apply for only one of these fellowships (RF, STF, and ADF) per academic year. You can be awarded a maximum of two distinguished fellowships during your time at Fordham.**

**If you hold two Continuing Student DFs within your funded years, you are eligible for one additional year of funding.**Example: Your admission letter indicates six years of funding. You received an RF in your fourth year and an ADF in your sixth year. In both cases, the fellowship replaced your institutional funding for that year, and you received the higher, distinguished fellowship amount. In recognition of having been awarded a distinguished fellowship, you will receive one additional year of funding (year 7) at the TF rate, not two. If you continue into an eighth year, you are eligible to apply for a Teaching Associate position.

**If you hold one Continuing Student DF and one prestigious external fellowship within your funded years, you will receive one additional year of funding.**Example: Your admission letter indicates five years of funding. You received an STF in your third year and a prestigious external fellowship in your fifth year. Both replaced your institutional funding for those years with the higher fellowship award. At the end of your regular funding period, you will receive one additional year of funding at the TF rate (year 6).

**If you are awarded a DF or prestigious external fellowship outside of your funded years, you are not eligible for any additional year of institutional funding.**Example: Your admission letter indicates four years of funding. You receive an ADF in your fifth year (outside the funded period). Since the DF fellowship is held after your funded period, you will not receive an additional year of funding. The same applies if you receive a prestigious external fellowship after your funded period.
