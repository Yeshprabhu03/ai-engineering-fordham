The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) Research Fellowship provides support for our students to work as research fellows. The fellowship provides support for students who wish to work closely with advisor to develop their own dissertation research projects or to learn methods or procedures that they will use on their own dissertation research. This support will be offered on a competitive basis and will reward students who have already submitted proposals for fellowships, published articles and/or book reviews, or presented papers at conferences. Second priority will be given to students who have already made significant progress toward these goals.

Students who are awarded this fellowship will be freed from teaching and other research obligations in order to focus on their own work.

**Award Information**

The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Research Fellowship provides an academic year stipend and tuition scholarship. For programs based on 12-month financial aid packages, a 12-month stipend is provided. For updated stipend rates, please see [Stipends and Scholarships](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/financial-support/stipends-and-scholarships/).

**Eligibility**

Doctoral students in good standing with satisfactory academic progress according to the guidelines established by us and **who will have completed at least six semesters of full-time graduate study** (with at least four of these semesters at Fordham GSAS) by the time the Fellowship begins are eligible to apply for the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Research Fellowship. A student may receive nomination for only **one** of the three academic-year merit awards for advanced students (Research Fellowship, Senior Teaching Fellowship, or Alumni Dissertation Fellowship, Renaissance Society of America Fellowship, or some Research Fellowships). Although a student may also apply for a Summer Fellowship, a student cannot simultaneously be awarded a 12-month merit award (i.e., the Alumni Dissertation Fellowship or Research Fellowship, Renaissance Society of America Fellowship, or some Research Fellowships) and a Summer Fellowship.

Once granted, the recipient of the award must be certified as full-time and meet satisfactory academic performance and progress requirements. Additionally, the recipient may not hold any other work assignments at the University during the fellowship period, unless granted authorization to do so by the vice dean.

**Guidelines for Project Narrative**The narrative for a Research Fellowship Application should not exceed five double-spaced pages, not including the accompanying bibliography (minimum 12-pt. font for the whole document). It should explain the objectives, methods and original contribution of the project in succinct, jargon-free language. (Remember that your proposal will be reviewed by faculty members outside of your disciplinary area.)

For the Humanities, the following questions and directives adapted from a National Endowment for the Humanities document may be useful to prepare the project narrative:

- What contribution will the project make?

- Where will you conduct the study and what materials will you use? Describe access to laboratories, archives, collections, or institutions with the necessary resources.
- Who is the intended audience for the results of the study?
- What are the intended results of the project? Indicate plans for articles, conference papers, books, etc.

For the Sciences and Social Sciences, the following research plan outline is appropriate:

- Abstract Paragraph
- Specific Aims (What do you intend to accomplish?) Specifically describe what you will accomplish during the Fellowship period, and relate this to Aims of the broader project. Please be focused and clear and include the intended outcomes:
- Background and Significance (Why is this work important to the field?)
- Define the problem. Explain what gaps in current knowledge would be filled by your research. Describe explicitly your hypothesis and how it will be tested. Relate this section to the Specific Aims.
