The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Summer Fellowships provide support for master's and doctoral students who wish to devote the summer to improving their professional credentials beyond the normal expectations of their program, which could include but are not limited to preparing proposals to apply for prestigious fellowships, articles for publication, conference papers, training, and workshops. Students are not allowed to hold a Summer Fellowship more than two out of five years.

## Award Information

### Eligibility

Doctoral students and master's students in good standing with satisfactory academic progress according to the guidelines established by Fordham GSAS and who will have completed at least two semesters of full-time graduate study (minimum of 18 credits) in the GSAS by the time the Fellowship begins are eligible to apply for the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Summer Fellowship. Recipients must devote full-time work to the proposed project during the summer. Funds must be used to assist in the student's progression toward completion of degree.

The following departments or programs (Biological Sciences, Economics, and IPED) have local summer opportunities, and we encourage students from these programs to apply through those resources. Unfortunately, due to our limited capacity, we are not accepting Summer applications from these programs.
