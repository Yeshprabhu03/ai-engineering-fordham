- Proposals should indicate how the project at hand will critically reflect on the role of women and gender in Christianity historically and today. They may, for example, reflect on specific historical or contemporary events that have shaped the perception and role of women within church teachings, liturgical practices, the development of church institutions, and/or the relationship between Christian communities and societies writ large (among other topics).
- From their assessment of the extant literature and their planned research contributions, applicants may also suggest how the new knowledge formed by their projects may reconfigure the role and perceptions of women in Christianity.

Along these lines, they should also clearly identify their project deliverables (e.g., preparing an article for conference presentations and/or article publications, supporting dissertation research, etc.).
