The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Santander International Internships Fellowships provide support for masters and doctoral students who wish to devote the summer to working with an international non-governmental organization (NGO).

## Award Information

The Santander International Internships Fellowship provides financial support for travel, visas, living and program expenses for GSAS students doing summer internships and field work abroad. The amount of the award can vary depending on the details of the proposal. The amount requested must be justified with a detailed budget and supporting documentation (see GSAS Budget Proposal Form in application instructions below).

*If a student plans to complete an internship for an NGO, and can do so in the absence of travel arrangements, then the student may be eligible to receive this award. Please plan accordingly when preparing your application.*
