# SSG Deadlines

SSG proposals will be reviewed semi-annually. Due to University fiscal year budget constraints, applicants are strongly encouraged to apply for an SSG as early as possible, and before their proposed project takes place.

Applications for projects that occur or are undertaken outside of the recommended time frame may be considered after other applications are awarded, subject to funding availability and only during the next funding cycle. For example, if you attend a conference in June, ideally you can apply for the spring funding cycle; however, you may apply for the fall deadline if in the spring you are not given an award.

For the 2025-26 academic year, completed applications will be due:

| Fall Funding Cycle Application Deadline | Spring Funding Cycle Application Deadline |
|---|---|
|
Closes: Monday, January 5, 2026 For activities occurring between November and MarchIf your project does not fall in this window, please apply anyway! Applications will be reviewed based on merit. |
Closes: TBD For activities occurring between April and OctoberIf your project does not fall in this window, please apply anyway! Applications will be reviewed based on merit. |

SSG proposals will be reviewed following the submission deadlines and award decisions will be communicated to applicants in a timely manner. Committee availability and University closures may affect the schedule of application reviews.
