### 2025 – 2026 Merit-Based Funding Renewals

### GSAS Graduate Assistantship, Research Assistantship, and Teaching Fellowship

Students who were admitted with merit-based funding must indicate annually their intent to continue on such funding. This category is open only to students who received a multi-year merit-based funding package upon admission. Continuation of merit based funding beyond the initial year is contingent, in part, upon the funding package granted at admission and upon satisfactory academic performance and/or progress.

### GSAS Distinguished Fellowships

([Research Fellowship](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/financial-support/fellowships/distinguished-fellowships/research-fellowship/), [Senior Teaching Fellowship](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/financial-support/fellowships/distinguished-fellowships/senior-teaching-fellowship/), and [Alumni Dissertation Fellowship](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/financial-support/fellowships/distinguished-fellowships/alumni-dissertation-fellowship/))

All matriculated students, whether they have been admitted with or without merit-based funding, may apply for [GSAS Distinguished Fellowships](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/financial-support/fellowships/distinguished-fellowships/), but note that there are specific eligibility criteria for the distinguished awards.

### GSAS Teaching Associateship

Applications are open only to those students in doctoral programs who have exhausted their funding or been admitted without funding.
