# Matriculated GSAS Student Status Certification

The [Status Certification Form](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/pdfs/jadu-single-folder-pdfs/matriculated_student_status_certification_form.pdf) form must be completed by a student who may be registered for insufficient credits to qualify for 1/2, 3/4 or full-time certification (according to its school or programs policy) for purposes of Veteran's Benefits, the New York State Tuition Assistance Program, Federal Loan Certification or Deferment, or any combination of the above choices.

Department Chair/Program Director completes Section D of the form and will need to assess the academic related activity that the student is engaged in and determine the appropriate credit equivalency. The definition of a credit hour is provided below as a guideline to aid in that assessment.

A credit hour is an amount of work that reasonably approximates not less than:

- One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class work each week for approximately 15 weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or 10 to 12 weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or at least the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or,
- At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours.
