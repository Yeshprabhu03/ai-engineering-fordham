# Badminton Club

We endeavor to provide a welcoming and inclusive environment to all those who want to play badminton. We believe that badminton is a sport suitable for beginners, and is accessible to a wide range of the graduate students at Fordham University. We also believe that the badminton charter group will serve as an avenue to foster graduate student physical and mental wellness, as well as offering the opportunity for students from different departments to connect.
