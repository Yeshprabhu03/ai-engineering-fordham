# GSAS Graduate Student Council Funding

As a matter of stewardship, the GSC’s budget is sourced predominantly from a small percentage of the student fees paid each semester by GSAS. As such, a significant portion of our annual budget is devoted to providing funding for departments to develop and support their own graduate programming as well as running a competitive, multi-track grant for those seeking support for research, conference travel, and alternative learning experiences. It is our goal to give back this money as much as possible to promote the well-being and growth of all our colleagues. Please see below for some of our funding initiatives:

The GSC is also proud to support the work of several charter groups developed and run by graduate students. If you are interested in starting a charter group or in joining a particular charter group, please visit the [Chartered Groups](/graduate-school-of-arts-and-sciences/student-resources/graduate-student-council/charter-groups/) page.
