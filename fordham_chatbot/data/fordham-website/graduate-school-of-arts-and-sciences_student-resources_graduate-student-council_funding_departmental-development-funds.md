# GSAS Graduate Student Council Departmental Development Funds

The GSC allocates a sizable percentage of its annual budget to funding department-specific events such as conferences, workshops, symposia, and speaker series. This percentage is split evenly across all seventeen graduate departments and a specific honorary ‘international students’ department with the available amount of funding per department being $4,000. Requests for more will be taken on a case by case basis.

Students interested in applying for departmental development funds (DDF) should contact their respective GSC representative. In addition to an estimated budget, the applicant must submit a 100 – 150 word advertisement of the event, which will be promoted through the GSC in anticipation of the event.
