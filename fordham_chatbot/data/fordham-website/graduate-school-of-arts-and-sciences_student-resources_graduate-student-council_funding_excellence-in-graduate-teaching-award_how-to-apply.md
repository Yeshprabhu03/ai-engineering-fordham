# GSAS Graduate Student Council Graduate Teaching Award - How to Apply

## Award Types

This spring, the GSC will grant two Graduate Student Teaching Awards ($1000). As of 2022, we are proud to announce an additional category which honors graduate student instructors and teaching assistants that best incorporate anti-racist teaching practices into their teaching ($1000). Please review the following rubrics as you make your application.

Both Graduate Instructors and Teaching Assistants are eligible to apply. The GSC understands that teaching designations sometimes vary across departments. If you are unsure if you qualify, please contact the GSC at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#17706474786279747e7b57717865737f767a39727362).

### Application Timeline

Opens: Wednesday, March 21, 2025

Closes: Wednesday, April 22, 2025

### Eligibility

- Applicant must be a matriculated GSAS student in good academic standing.
- Applicants must have experience as a Teaching Assistant or Course Instructor for undergraduate or graduate students at Fordham for two full semesters prior to the application deadline. Semesters need not be consecutive.
- Award recipients must be willing to serve as a future Excellence in Graduate Teaching Award review committee member.

### Review Process

Applications will be reviewed in a timely manner following the submission deadline by a committee of graduate students, with representation from each of the four academic divisions (i.e., humanities, natural sciences, social sciences, and interdisciplinary programs). Committee members will review and score each application individually, after which the committee will convene to discuss applicant rankings and select final award recipients. In extenuating circumstances in which the committee cannot reach consensus among top applications, the committee may request to observe finalists’ teaching directly via either video submission or live observations. Award decisions will be communicated to applicants via email by the end of the spring semester.
