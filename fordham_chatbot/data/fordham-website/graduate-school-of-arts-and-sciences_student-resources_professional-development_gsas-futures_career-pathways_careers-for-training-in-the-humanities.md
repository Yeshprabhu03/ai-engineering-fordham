# Careers for Training in the Humanities

Individuals with expertise in humanities fields can, and have, made their mark in a wide range of professional environments. Advanced study in the humanities cultivates a specific – and in-demand – skillset, including “[communication, listening, problem solving, critical thinking, [and] empathy](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Jobs-Will-Save-the-Humanities/243767).”

Employers not only actively seek out individuals who are practiced in discussion, who can synthesize, analyze, and draw conclusions from multiple perspectives, and who have excellent organization and project management skills. Beyond these basic contributions, professionals with humanities training often emerge as workplace leaders thanks to their versatile and entrepreneurial thinking.

Moreover, humanists themselves often discover that many different types of environments can stimulate their intellectual imaginations, stretch their skillsets, and offer them latitude to make a positive institutional and social impact. And they find their work in many workplace environments both purposeful and fulfilling.

Some humanists are able to effectively translate their skills to prospective employers’ needs. Therefore, they may submit job documents and interview in ways that help professional teams understand how their skills and expertise adds value to the organization they hope to join. But a more effective approach to simply translating one’s skillset is to gain experience in workplace settings **before** seeking a full-time role within them. Therefore, experience gained via internships, externships, part-time roles, or volunteer work (when judiciously undertaken) may prove invaluable to future professional pursuits.

Consult with mentors – including faculty members and Career Services counselors – to help you determine the best approach to gaining relevant and desired professional experience.
