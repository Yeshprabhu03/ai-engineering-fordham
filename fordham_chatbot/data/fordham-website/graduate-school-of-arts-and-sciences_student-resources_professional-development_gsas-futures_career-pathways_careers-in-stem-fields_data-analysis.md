# STEM Field Career Data Analysis

Much like their close professional counterparts – [data scientists](https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/analytics/what-is-a-data-scientist.html) – data analysts compile, process, examine, and analyze data sets to answer questions and solve problems. Positions in data analysis have emerged in large numbers thanks to the new availability of [big data](https://www.bernardmarr.com/default.asp?contentID=766) that has accompanied the digital age of the twenty-first century world. With expertise in quantitative methods that include statistics, programming, data correlations, learning theory, and machine learning, data analysts may be found in fields that include business, finance, e-commerce, healthcare, government, and information technologies.

Data analysts serve organizations in many capacities, from journalism to strategic research, making use of a combined skill set that emphasizes their capacity to work with data sets while presenting their research findings to diverse audiences within and beyond their organizations.

An effective data analyst has a demonstrated capacity to:

- Provide data reports and visualizations to convey conclusions from data set analysis
- Establish organizational goals and data-driven questions with management, business, and product teams
- Improve and streamline data analysis processes
- Create and maintain data models and dashboards
- Work closely with IT and R&D teams on organizational objectives

[Glassdoor.com](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/data-analyst-salary-SRCH_KO0,12.htm) reports that data analysts garner an annual salary of approximately $67,377. Sometimes considered “[junior data scientists](http://www.mastersindatascience.org/careers/data-analyst/),” data analysts have significant crossover with data scientists in their daily tasks, although they may experience less freedom to design and manage their own data-driven projects, relying instead on pre-existing tools and methods. Nevertheless, some companies make no distinction between the two roles. Both require creative thinking and a sophisticated facility with quantitative methods.
