# Guide to the GSAS Mentoring Network

The purpose of the GSAS Mentoring Network is to connect graduate students with GSAS alumni from around the world, and to provide new opportunities for graduate students to receive various levels of mentoring support.

**Why should I connect with an alumni mentor?**

A mentor is someone that concerns themselves with your individual growth and well-being. While an advisor provides you with support that is limited to your academic progress, a mentor works to advance your academic, professional, and personal goals. The concerns of a mentor are much broader than that of an academic advisor.


With this in mind, it is often the case that our best mentors are non-faculty mentors—in particular, alumni mentors. The alumni within the Fordham GSAS mentoring community share in common the facts that they have been in your position before, they have an informed understanding of what a strong mentoring relationship looks like, and—most importantly—they know how important mentoring support is for success in graduate school. By connecting with these alumni, you stand to benefit from their considerable expertise and experience, as well as from new relationships of support and guidance that can contribute to your progress.
