**Managing Stereotype Threat on the Job Market**

Join GSAS Futures in conversation with Rufus E. Jones, co-founder and President of the James Weldon Johnson Foundation. Jones will discuss a challenge endemic to many new candidates seeking jobs in academic and industry circles alike: "stereotype threat." Candidates are often unaware of the capacity for stereotype threat to negatively impact their pursuit of professional success. Stereotype threat involves an individual undermining his or her own performance at a given task because of widespread beliefs that a social group in which he or she identifies - including groups organized by race, gender, nation or age - do not "naturally" perform well at that particular task.

Stereotype threat can breed anxiety and create conditions of self-sabotage in which job candidates struggle to perform well on interviews, negotiate contracts with new employers, and perform new jobs with competence and confidence. Feelings of discomfort may accompany settings where there are few "people like me." Nevertheless, enhanced awareness and understanding of stereotype threat can greatly reduce its effects. Jones will discuss his own journey as an individual of color who moved from Harvard to Wall Street to roles promoting education and the arts as a teacher, administrator, coach, and fundraiser.

Jones will discuss stereotype threat as he draws from his own experience alongside of references to a research project he is co-facilitating on stereotype threat between the James Weldon Johnson Foundation and a laboratory at New York University. He will discuss challenges that individuals may encounter as they pursue a range of professions and will offer practical coping strategies, including the use of interventions, language, and tactics to effectively handle situations to mitigate the effects of stereotype threat and promote a job candidate's success.

## March 2018

**Surviving Graduate School with Your Sanity and Satisfaction Intact**

Join GSAS Futures and the Office of Career Services for a panel discussion featuring two recent Fordham alumni - Anna Beskin, English, GSAS '16, and Jason Aloisio, Biological Sciences, GSAS '17 - on maintaining one's well-being while coping with the rigors of graduate education and its accompanying transition into a fulfilling profession.

Drs. Beskin and Aloisio will comment on topics related to achieving a healthy work-life balance, including raising families as graduate students, coping with the expectations of demanding bosses and faculty mentors, managing pressures to maintain high levels of research productivity, the challenges of seeking employment during and after graduate school, and recovering from setbacks in the degree completion process.

Drs. Beskin and Aloisio will be joined by Dr. Debbie Lawrence from the Office of Counseling and Psychological Services. Dr. Lawrence will describe challenges common to the graduate student experience across the master's and doctoral levels and will offer practical advice on available coping mechanisms.

## February 2018

**Career Conversation: Teaching at an Independent School**

GSAS Futures invites you to join Judith Sheridan, Ph.D., Associate Director for Evaluation and Accreditation at the New York State Association of Independent Schools and Fordham Ph.D. candidate, Bronwen Durocher (English), for a conversation on teaching at an independent school.

Incorporating a large body of private and parochial schools, independent schools are often autonomous institutions that value creative and rigorous approaches to classroom instruction. Independent schools court individuals with advanced degrees, including master's and Ph.D.'s, with an interest in applying their expertise to classroom teaching. State certification is not always a requirement for independent school teaching, and schools that do require certification typically offer guidance and support for teachers to become certified.

Ms. Durocher, who teaches at Riverdale Country School, will describe her experience transitioning from graduate school into an independent school classroom, along with her day-to-day experience teaching. Dr. Sheridan will also discuss her journey from university to secondary school teaching at an independent school. Having worked as the director of an independent school in Manhattan, Dr. Sheridan hired a number of graduate students and will describe the traits that accompany ideal independent school candidates.
