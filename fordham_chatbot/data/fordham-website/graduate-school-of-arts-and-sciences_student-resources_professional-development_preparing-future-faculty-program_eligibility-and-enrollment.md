All GSAS students who are enrolled in a Ph.D. program, have completed at least 12 credits of graduate-level coursework, taught at least one course, and are in good academic standing at Fordham University will be eligible to sign up and enroll in PFFI.

We encourage (but do not require) students to enroll in the program around the third year of their Ph.D. program. The call for applications is typically announced in late summer or early fall. The program commences in late September, so the enrollment deadline falls sometime around mid-September. Students must obtain departmental approval by contacting their Director of Graduate Studies (DGS) or Associate Chair for Graduate Studies (ACGS) prior to joining the program. Students will satisfy PFFI requirements within one academic year Students in their final years at Fordham are still eligible and encouraged to enroll. Upon completing the PFFI requirements, participants will receive an official PFFI Certificate of Completion that they can include on their CV.

### Enrollment

Each student’s DGS or ACGS coordinates enrollment in PFFI. Students should contact their DGS or ACGS to discuss how the program fits into their departmental training and to indicate interest in enrolling. Programming will begin in the Fall semester and run through the Spring semester.

### Completing the program

To complete PFFI, students must attend the majority of the synchronous events (via Zoom) and complete required activities to receive their official PFFI Certificate of Completion: which includes developing an online portfolio, completing class observations, developing and workshopping job market material, and attending mock interviews. It is encouraged for students to meet with a departmental mentor to review that portfolio and discuss their progress. If you are not sure who your PFFI department contact is, please email the PFFI organizers at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f0809696b0969f829498919dde959485).
