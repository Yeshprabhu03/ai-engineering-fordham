Alexander explores how we can come together in agonistic disputes, rather than antagonistic, and why it is important to teach our children to be comfortable with disagreements.

## 3rd place: Louisa Foroughi

Ph.D. candidate in History

*"What is Yeoman? Status and Identity in Later Medieval England"*

The political meaning attached to the fifteenth century yeomen farmers give us context through which to better understand the rise of the modern American middle class.
