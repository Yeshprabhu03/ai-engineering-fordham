EdTPA is a performance-based, subject-specific assessment and support system used by more than 600 teacher preparation programs in some 40 states to emphasize, measure and support the skills and knowledge that all teachers need from Day 1 in the classroom.

Developed by educators for educators, edTPA is the first such standards-based assessment to become nationally available in the United States. It builds on decades of work on assessments of teacher performance and research regarding teaching skills that improve student learning.

It is transforming the preparation and certification of new teachers by complementing subject-area assessments with a rigorous process that requires teacher candidates to demonstrate that they have the classroom skills necessary to ensure students are learning.

Between September 1 and August 31, the New York State Education Department collects data on all students enrolled in or completing teacher or educational leader preparation programs. This data is used for three purposes.

- Federal Reporting Requirements for Title II, Section 207, of the Higher Education Act: Title II reporting requires pass rate data for program enrollees and completers in New York State teacher preparation programs.
- Teacher and Educational Leader Preparation Program Profiles
- To Ensure Institutional Accountability (as described in Commissioner’s regulations Part 52.21 (b) (2) (iv))

We are required to provide data for all candidates who are enrolled or have completed an NYS teacher preparation and/or NYS educational leader preparation program during the current collection period. These data are then compared with testing records and certification records, to create the required Title II reports and the NYS Teacher and Educational Leader Preparation Program Profiles.

Section 205 of Title II of the Higher Education Act (HEA) of 1965, as amended in 2008, requires that each institution of higher education (IHE) or organization that conducts a traditional or alternative teacher preparation program submit annual reports containing key requirements and characteristics of their programs to their respective states. New York State has opted to use the Institutional and Program Report Card reporting system (IPRC) in order to collect these reports.

Section 205(a) of Title II requires each IHE to report annually on:

- Basic aspects of its teacher preparation program, such as admissions requirements; number of students enrolled by gender, ethnicity and race; information about supervised clinical experience; the number of students prepared by academic major and subject area; and the number of program completers;
- Goals for increasing the number of teachers trained in shortage area and assurances about aspects of teacher training;
- How well groups of students perform on initial state licensing and certification assessments;
- Approval or accreditation of the teacher preparation program and whether the program is under a designation of “low-performing;” and
- Information about preparing teachers to use technology, to participate as a member of individualized education program teams and to teach students with disabilities or who are limited English proficient.
