![Teachers with Students](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/teacher-students.jpg)

The Accelerated MST Integrated Teacher Education Track provides opportunities for Fordham undergraduates to complete a B.A/.B.S. in a liberal arts and sciences major and a [Master of Science in Teaching](https://www.fordham.edu/graduate-school-of-education/academics/degree-and-certificate-programs/become-a-teacher/master-of-science-in-teaching/) (M.S.T.). **Students must enroll in the program prior to their senior year of undergraduate work in order to take advantage of fulfilling 12 graduate credits as an undergraduate.**

The integrated track is based on a reflective practitioner model with cohorts of students progressing through a sequence of coordinated courses and field experiences designed to link theory and practice.

Why should I apply for the Accelerated MST Program?

The Accelerated MST Program is a time-efficient and cost-effective way to earn both a bachelor's and a master's degree. The Graduate School of Education works to prepare and develop **highly qualified teachers who are committed to reflective practice, lifelong learning, professional and school excellence, respect for individuals in a multicultural society, and excellence in academic disciplines.**

The goals of the field experiences are to:

- examine your interest in teaching and to make an informed decision about teaching as a career.
- gain insight into the curriculum and organization of a school, classroom or educational settings.
- work with students on different age levels.
- allow education faculty to learn about your disposition, motivation, skills, and suitability for teaching.
- prepare you for a 5th year student teaching experience.

We require a minimum of 30 hours of fieldwork in a school or approved educational setting each semester. In choosing a site, our students look for the opportunity to be an active participant in teaching-learning and to gain exposure to diverse educational settings and age groups.
