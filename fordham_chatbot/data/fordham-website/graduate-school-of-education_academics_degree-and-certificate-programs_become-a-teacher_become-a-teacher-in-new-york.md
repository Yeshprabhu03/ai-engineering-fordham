## Determine Who You Want to Teach

Teaching requirements vary depending on the grade level, the subject(s) you are interested in teaching, and in which state(s) you would like to become certified. Many teacher preparation programs designate if they are for early, elementary, or secondary education. You may also be given the option to choose a specialized track that concentrates on teaching a certain population of children or subject area.

## Complete a New York State-Approved Teacher Preparation Program

After you complete your bachelor’s degree and determine who and where you would like to teach, it’s time to complete an [approved New York state teacher preparation program](http://www.nysed.gov/heds/IRPSL1.html).

It also puts you on a path to getting certified. After successfully completing a teacher preparation program, you are eligible to receive an institutional recommendation from the university for your New York initial teaching certification.

Teacher preparation programs are specifically designed to prepare you for your individual teaching goals, so it is important to consider what kind of program aligns with your values and lifestyle.

You should choose a program that both challenges you and prepares you to teach the population of students and subject matter you are interested in. For example, what you learn in special education, secondary education, or teaching English to speakers of other languages (TESOL) teacher preparation programs can lead to very different teaching careers.
