**Please Note: Admissions to the following program are currently on hold for the 2025-2026 application cycle. Program faculty are in the process of redesigning this program and we will update this site to indicate future admission cycles.**

To nurture middle school and high school students’ knowledge and appreciation of the physical sciences, a teacher needs more than a foundation in physics.

This program develops teacher candidates’ knowledge and understanding of adolescent learning and development, educational theory, and best practices in science education.

## Application Deadlines

## Fieldwork Requirements

In the fall and spring semesters of the first year, students are in classrooms for three full days per week: observation for three weeks, then student teaching, in the same classroom, for ten weeks.

In the fall and spring semesters of the second year, students are in classrooms for five full days per week: observation for two weeks, then student teaching, in the same classroom, for twelve weeks.

## Certification Information

The program leads to a Master of Science in Teaching degree and initial New York State certification.

Teacher candidates who meet all program requirements, complete the course of study, and meet established field experience competencies are eligible for Fordham University’s endorsement for New York state initial certification in their program area.

Pass rates for Fordham’s initial teacher education graduates on the NYSTCE Teacher exams have been over 95% each year.

Programs are open to all who qualify; however, only U.S. citizens or international students who possess a U.S. Green Card or H1-B visa may be recommended for New York State teacher certification.
