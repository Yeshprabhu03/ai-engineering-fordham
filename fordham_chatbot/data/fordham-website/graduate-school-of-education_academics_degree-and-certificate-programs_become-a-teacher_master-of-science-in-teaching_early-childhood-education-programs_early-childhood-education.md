## Fieldwork Requirements

The practical application of theory, teaching strategies, curriculum construction, and behavior management is woven into student teaching throughout our program. Generally, student teaching requires one full academic year, with placements in two different grade levels with general education and special education students. In the fall semester, students complete four full days per week, and in the spring semester, four full days per week. Students are mentored by a field specialist and placed in our high-needs partnership schools in New York City.
