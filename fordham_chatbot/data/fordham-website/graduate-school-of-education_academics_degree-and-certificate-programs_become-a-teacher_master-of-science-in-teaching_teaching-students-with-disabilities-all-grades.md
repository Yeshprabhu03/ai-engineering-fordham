To help students with disabilities reach their personal and academic potential, it is essential to have skilled teachers who are well-versed in student learning and development, Pre K-12 curriculum content, and effective pedagogy. These teachers should also possess the knowledge and skills to adapt learning environments and experiences to meet the unique needs of each child.

The Special Education program for Grades PreK-12 prepares such educators through a rigorous academic curriculum. This program integrates a strong foundation in PreK-12 education and psychology with a comprehensive sequence of field experiences and student teaching opportunities, ensuring graduates are well-prepared to support diverse learners effectively.
