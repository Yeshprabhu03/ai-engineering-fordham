The Doctorate in Educational Leadership, Administration and Policy (ELAP) is designed to prepare transformative leaders who are equity-minded problem solvers and designers of innovative solutions, using scholarly inquiry to improve schools, districts, and communities for all children. The program is based on the recognition that leadership must be an intellectual, creative and moral practice. **Read more about the Curriculum and Immersion Experiences in the drop-down menu below.**

The program is designed around four core areas: educational leadership and organizational change; leading teaching and learning; engaging and transforming schools, districts and communities; and policy and advocacy. Three signature pedagogies are foundational to our coursework and guide the dissertation in practice: social justice and ethics; scholarly inquiry and research; and problem-solving and design. The program emphasizes improvement science as a primary approach to inquiry, problem-solving, and innovation for school improvement.

#### Curriculum

Leadership—especially in education—must be an intellectual, creative, and moral practice. Using improvement science as a primary approach, the Ed.D. curriculum focuses on preparing social-justice-minded educational leaders to solve problems and design solutions that benefit schools and student learning.

The Ed.D. program consists of 50 credit hours. The curriculum is designed around four core practice areas:

- Educational Leadership and Organizational Change
- Leading Teaching and Learning
- Engaging and Transforming Schools, Districts, and Communities
- Policy and Advocacy

Through interactive coursework and collaborative discussions, students learn to advocate for educational policy reform, improve schools using research and improvement science, and act as change agents who engage with and support the transformation of schools, districts, and communities.

#### Immersion Experiences

-
During the first two years of the program, students must complete four Laboratories of Practice (LoP), which are practicum experiences that are to be incorporated into four core content courses, one from each domain. Each LoP provides an opportunity for candidates to apply their understanding of research and theory to understand and address authentic problems of practice in the field. These four LoPs are as follows:

**Practicum in Professional Learning**

Candidates complete an inquiry project on professional learning that includes data collection about a school or district professional learning need, analysis of key research and literature on professional learning, proposing strategies for promoting professional learning in their school or district context, and soliciting feedback from key stakeholders in their context.

**Practicum in Policies for Improvement**

Candidates complete an inquiry project on the role of policy in school improvement by collecting data on a policy need or gap, analyzing the gap from key research and literature on policy and advocacy, developing a policy brief or advocacy strategy, soliciting feedback from key stakeholders on the feasibility and use of their proposed strategy.

**Practicum in Transforming Schools, Districts and Communities**

Candidates complete an inquiry project on engaging and transforming schools, districts or communities by collecting data on a student need or gap, analyzing the gap from key research and literature how to engage families and communities to address this need, developing a plan and set of strategies, soliciting feedback from stakeholders on the feasibility and use of their proposed plan.

**Practicum in Leadership and Organizational Learning and Change**

Candidates complete an inquiry project on leadership and organizational change to support school improvement that includes data collection about a school or district school improvement need and priority, analysis of key research and literature on leadership and organizational change for school improvement effectiveness, proposing strategies for promoting organizational change in their school or district context, and soliciting feedback from key stakeholders in their context.

-
As a culminating experience, students will complete an inquiry-grounded, solutions-oriented Dissertation of Practice. Following the principles improvement science, students will be prepared to address relevant problems of practice in their school or district setting. In doing so, candidates will make a significant contribution to practice through their work and learn an inquiry-grounded and solutions-oriented approach to improvement that can guide their work as leaders in the future.

Throughout the program’s Year 3, students will complete four courses, during which they will design and complete a dissertation of practice that addresses a problem of practice using improvement science and relevant applied research methods.
