**Career Path:**The program prepares graduates to be competitive in diverse settings and fields in which education is at the fore, including non-profits, businesses, the media, museums, the arts, and schools.

The Contemporary Learning and Interdisciplinary Research (CLAIR) PhD program caters to students in search of cutting edge, cross-disciplinary solutions to current and anticipated issues in the very nature and delivery of education. [Watch a video from one of our students about the program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIPSb9mT0OY), which includes structures that search through coursework in quantitative and qualitative research methods, and in principles of learning, instruction, and appreciation and promotion of diversity. Students also partake in internships to gain first-hand experience of the different venues in which education occurs.


Guided by the belief that education should be transformative, this unique program fosters ethical, versatile, and collaborative scholars who embrace multiple paradigms of inquiry to understand and improve contemporary learning environments.

Through the perspective of multiple paradigms and the use of multiple methodologies, research teams of university faculty and CLAIR students generate new knowledge, test hypotheses, and solve problems related to contemporary learning.
