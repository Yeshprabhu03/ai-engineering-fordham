# Advanced Certificate in Jesuit Studies

**This hybrid program includes on-campus and online coursework.**

The advanced certificate in Jesuit studies offers essential grounding in the spirit and practice of Jesuit history, pedagogy, and spirituality.

This program was developed with the goal of reaching out to lay collaborators, alumni, and others interested in Jesuit middle and secondary education, higher education institutions, parishes, and Jesuit social ministries. It focuses on Ignatian spirituality and history, and the program includes courses from biblical to contemporary periods, discernment, and the history of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). This certificate requires a one-week (M-F) July immersive experience at one of Fordham's New York City campuses which involves seminars and excursions into the city.

Ideal for anyone working at a Jesuit institution or with Jesuits in various ministries, this certificate follows an adult education model, where a student's background and experience both inform and enhance each learning component of the program. Requiring only a bachelor's degree of any sort, the ideal student for this certificate is anyone longing to know more about the Jesuit context within which they work, worship, or relax.
