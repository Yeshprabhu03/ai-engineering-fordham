The Black Education: Faith, Race, and Educational Equity (BE: FREE) research project explores Black educational leadership through a race-conscious and culturally sensitive lens. It focuses on how community, faith, race, and civic engagement intersect to shape educational equity and leadership practices. The project highlights innovative, culturally enriched approaches to teaching, leading, and community engagement. Participants, including faculty, students, and staff, engage in critical discussions through BE: FREE’s programs to better understand Black educational leadership. The research aims to promote sustained positive outcomes for students, schools, and communities.
