# Black Education: Faith, Race, and Educational Equity (BE: FREE)

The Black Education: Faith, Race and Educational Equity (BE: FREE) research project, founded

and led by Dr. Phillip A. Smith, examines the phenomenon of Black educational leadership

grounded in a Black leadership epistemology (ways of knowing) as a race-conscious, culturally

sensitive pedagogical approach to teaching, leading, and learning. It explores the intersections of

community, race, faith, equity in education, and civic engagement as part of Black educational

leadership. BE: FREE showcases innovative, culturally rich educational practices, leadership,

critical conversations, and community engagement, towards sustained outcomes for students,

schools, and communities.

This project examines how faculty, students, staff, and community members who participate in

one or more of the BE: FREE Educational Leader Speaker Programs or related research

initiatives and collaborations describe and experience the nature of Black educational leadership,

community, community-engaged learning, and civic engagement.

## Community

Many of our current models of leadership rely heavily on colonized ways of thinking and doing.

Our models for leadership are hierarchical, linear, and one-dimensional which privileges one

over the many. There is limited evidence of sustained success in developing inclusive models of

leadership, teaching and learning that positions race, equity and faith in community as central to

the leadership experience. In considering connections between Black education leadership and

community engagement, as relates to social justice, activism, and advocacy, it is noted that:

For Black school principals, “community” is an expression of social justice

educational leadership, civil rights activism, and advocacy and commitment to the

transformation of an entrenched, segregated school system and structure. This is

evidenced through the greater (and positively encouraged) involvement levels of

parents and other community members in school activities, as a core aspect of the

leadership and decision-making processes of African-American school principals.**Smith, 2021, p.35.**


It is this deep sense of ‘community and leadership’ evidenced through collectivism, greater and

positively engaged levels of parental and other community involvement in school [education]

activities that typifies the leadership philosophies and practice of Black school leaders Black

school leadership. This is foundational to an improved understanding of Black educational

leadership and Black leadership epistemology.
