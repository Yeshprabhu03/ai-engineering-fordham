The Liberty Partnerships Program is a comprehensive pre-collegiate/dropout prevention program established in 1988 by the New York State Education Department. Fordham University has been a part of the Liberty Partnerships Program (LPP) since 1989.

Fordham University's LPP currently partners with local Bronx schools Jonas Bronck Academy, Bronx High School for Law and Community Service, Fordham High School For the Arts and the community based organization Madison Square Boys & Girls Club @ John E. Grimm III.Through these partnerships, LPP provides academic, social-emotional, and enrichment services to over 300 students enrolled in grades 6 through 12. Students are referred to LPP by teachers, guidance counselors, parents, school administration or through self and peer referral.
