### Credit Limit, Course Limitations

### Financial Responsibility Agreement

- All students who register for new course work will be required to electronically sign (e-sign) a
[Financial Responsibility Agreement (FRA)](https://www.fordham.edu/fra). Colleges and universities increasingly use such agreements to make sure students understand their financial obligation to the institution. - A Financial Responsibility Agreement is a disclosure agreement between you and Fordham University that states that you agree to pay all charges that result from your registration and services you receive from the university. You will be asked to acknowledge that you understand that you are responsible to pay for all charges associated with your attendance and where applicable, residence costs at the university.
- If you refuse to sign the form, your enrollment will be subject to cancellation since you are not agreeing to pay the charges which you incur as a result of the services you receive at Fordham.

### Financing Options

For your convenience, we offer various payment methods which will assist you in paying your tuition. The payment options include: electronic; credit cards; checks and money orders; in person; third party billing; wire transfer (both domestic and international); monthly payment plan; tuition reimbursement; tuition stabilization plan; and tuition remission.

The Fordham University Monthly Payment Plan, offered by Tuition Management Systems, is a payment plan by which a student or parent, guardian, or sponsor of a student can make monthly payments for out-of-pocket expenses. For more information, please visit the payment plan website. The plan features:

- Ten monthly payments (for full-year plan)
- Five monthly payments (for term-only plan)
- Access (everyone qualifies)
- Low-cost enrollment fee
- Flexibility (Plan may be established for any amount)

### Refunds

- The University's refund policies and procedures ensure equitable refunds to students who withdraw from all or a portion of their studies or when payment is in excess of the total charges.
- View the
[refund schedules](/student-financial-services/tuition-and-payments/paying-your-bill/refunds/), which are based on 100% payment of all institutional charges and deposits.

### Health Insurance Waiver

If you already have health insurance coverage that meets Fordham’s policy standard minimum insurance requirements*, you may apply to waive enrollment in the Fordham plan. This waiver would remove the insurance charge from your student account.
