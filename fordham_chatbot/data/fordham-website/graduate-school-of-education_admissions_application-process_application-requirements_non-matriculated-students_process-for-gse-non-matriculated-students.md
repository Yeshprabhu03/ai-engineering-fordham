# Process for GSE Non-Matriculated Students

The Graduate School of Education has instituted a new online application for non‐matriculated students.

- Interested candidates must submit our online application.
- Courses for non‐matriculated candidates will be suggested and approved by GSE faculty based on student interests and program guidelines for specific academic programs in teaching, educational leadership, counseling, school psychology, and interdisciplinary research.
- Candidates will register themselves for classes after being approved by a faculty member and receiving a confirmation email from the GSE admissions office with registration instructions.
