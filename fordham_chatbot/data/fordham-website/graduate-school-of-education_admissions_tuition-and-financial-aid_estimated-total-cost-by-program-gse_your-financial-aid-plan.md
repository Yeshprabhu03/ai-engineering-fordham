# Creating Your Financial Plan

We’re committed to helping you figure out a plan that allows you to pursue your master’s degree while staying comfortable with your financial investment.

We suggest you begin the financial aid process as soon as possible. You should file your [FAFSA](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa) and make your loan request(s) at least four weeks prior to the start of classes.

A few key things to keep in mind when applying:

**The FAFSA must be filed annually.**

It is valid for the full academic year and is available until June 30 for each year. This means that the 2021–2022 FAFSA must be filed by June 20, 2022.**Fordham’s academic year begins with the fall term and ends with the summer term.**

Each fall term, students can receive up to $20,500 in Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds. If eligible for the maximum amount, the $20,500 will be divided and disbursed over the fall, spring, and summer terms.**Take origination fees into consideration!**

An origination fee is an upfront fee deducted from each Federal Direct Loan disbursement. It is charged by the federal government to help cover administrative fees associated with the federal loan programs.

## Start by estimating your charges for each semester:

Use Fordham’s per-credit tuition rate, fees per term, and the amount of credits in your specific program as a guide for your calculation.

- $1,500 per credit
- $332 estimated fees per term
- Some
[program track options](/graduate-school-of-education/academics/degree-and-certificate-programs/become-a-teacher/master-of-science-in-teaching/online-master-of-science-in-teaching/)require 36 credits; others require 45

## Then, consider options that can help reduce borrowing:

- Tuition assistance opportunities
- Scholarships
- Military benefits (if applicable)
- Out of pocket payments/personal resources

## Review your borrowing options for the remaining balance:
