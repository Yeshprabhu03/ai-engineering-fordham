# GSE Federal Loan Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy (SAP)

Each school of Fordham University has established minimum standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) that students must maintain as they pursue their degree or certificate. The University measures SAP annually at the end of the spring semester.

To be eligible for federal aid, such as Federal Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans or Graduate PLUS Loans, each student must be making SAP according to the School's standards.

To be eligible for federal financial aid, a Fordham Graduate School of Education student must:

- Maintain a grade point average of 3.00 for ADV, ADVN, MS, MSE, MST degrees; 3.50 for Ed.D., Ph.D. degrees
- Attempt and complete a minimum credit load as follows:
- Attempt and complete no fewer than 6 credit hours per term
- Attempt and complete no fewer than 3 credit hours per term for the xGRE programs noted below
- Maintain active term matriculation status (from term admitted to term graduated
- Complete the course of study for ADV, MS, MSE, MST degrees within 5 years; Ed.D., Ph.D. degrees within 8 years


Students who fail to attain satisfactory progress at the end of each academic year shall lose federal financial aid eligibility. Students can appeal to be placed on an academic plan or probation, allowing them to regain eligibility. If the student resumes satisfactory academic progress, the student shall regain federal financial aid eligibility as long as she/he maintains satisfactory academic progress.

Students enrolled in non-degree programs are not eligible for Federal aid and should look into a private education loan for non-degree programs.

For former Graduate School of Religion and Religious Education (xGRE) programs below, students must attempt and complete no fewer than 3 credit hours per term.

- Christian Spirituality (ADV/MA)
