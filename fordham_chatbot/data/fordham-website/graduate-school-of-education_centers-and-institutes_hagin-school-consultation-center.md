# Hagin School Consultation Center at GSE

The center is associated with the Division of Psychological and Educational Services of the Graduate School of Education at Fordham University, and serves as a training facility for students in the school psychology and counseling psychology programs.


Our mission as part of the Graduate School of Education at Fordham University is to support improvement in school achievement and wellbeing for individuals, families, and communities. As a training center, the Hagin center coordinates educational opportunities for students to provide psychological services, including comprehensive assessment and mental health treatment informed by empirically supported best practices in the related fields. Building on the university’s Jesuit tradition of social justice, the Hagin center strives to effectively serve diverse populations with increased cultural awareness and sensitivity. The students and staff aim to ensure their work is guided by anti-racist practice and is sensitive to the needs of people living through systems of oppression.
