The Hagin School Consultation Center at Fordham University offers an assessment-focused externship, providing training and supervision in all aspects of psychoeducational and neuropsychological evaluation. Externs will have the opportunity to extend their personal assessment skills as well as to develop skills in supervision of less advanced trainees (i.e., practicum students).

This externship is offered as a full academic year (September–May) externship, with two (2) days per week on site (16 hrs.). Additional hours may also be available during the summer session (June–July) as an extension to the externship.

The externs are expected to supervise two (2) graduate trainees on two (2) psychoeducational/neuropsychological assessments, each semester. This entails providing in vivo supervision of test administration and family intake and feedback, external school observations, individual support with test scoring, interpretation, case conceptualization, and report writing. The externs are also expected to conduct at least one (1) comprehensive psychoeducational or neuropsychological evaluation on their own each semester.

The externs receive intensive supervision, both in individual and small group formats, on a weekly basis. Externs meet with a licensed senior supervisor, for a minimum of two (2) hours per week. In addition, there is weekly small group supervision with all externs and senior supervisors.
