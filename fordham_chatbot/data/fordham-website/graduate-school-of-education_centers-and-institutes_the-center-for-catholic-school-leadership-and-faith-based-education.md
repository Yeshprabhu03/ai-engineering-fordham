# The Center for Catholic School Leadership and Faith-Based Education

## Mission Statement

The Center for Catholic School Leadership and Faith-Based Education prepares **transformational leaders** for the 21st century—leaders who are spiritually grounded, highly educated, creative, politically astute, technologically sophisticated, and globally minded.

For more than three decades, the center has been a hub for **research, professional development, and international collaboration**, shaping the future of Catholic and faith-based education. Under the auspices of Fordham University’s Graduate School of Education, it offers **master’s and doctoral degrees** that integrate Catholic identity, mission, and culture while welcoming educators of all faith traditions.

Committed to ecumenism and inclusivity, the center provides significant tuition scholarships for educators from Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, Muslim, and other religious communities, ensuring that faith-based education remains accessible and sustainable.

By combining academic excellence, leadership development, and global advocacy, the center empowers bishops, university presidents, school superintendents, and faith-based educators to lead with vision, integrity, and a deep commitment to service.
