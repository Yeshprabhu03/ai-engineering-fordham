The Center for Catholic School Leadership and Faith-Based Education offers ecumenical programs that welcome educators from across Christian denominations and other faith traditions. Rooted in Fordham’s Jesuit values and Catholic intellectual tradition, the Center prepares leaders in education, spiritual formation, and ministry who serve with integrity, advance the mission of their schools and communities, and foster inclusive environments. Courses are offered at Fordham’s Lincoln Center and Rose Hill campuses, in partnership with local dioceses and archdioceses, and through online study.
