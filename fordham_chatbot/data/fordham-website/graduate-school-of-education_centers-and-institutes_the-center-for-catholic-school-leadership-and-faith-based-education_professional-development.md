# Professional Development

The center offers several professional development programs for current leaders in faith-based schools throughout the year.

## Cabrini Program

The Cabrini Program is part of the Diocese's three-year orientation for new principals. For the first year, the Diocese concentrates on introducing principals to policies, procedures, and expectations. In years two and three, the center provides ongoing presentations for these principals on topics such as leadership, mission, and strategic planning.

## Catholic School Executive Leadership Dinner Lecture

The dinner is held annually by invitation only for superintendents and their staff. Presentation topics at the dinner address the need for executive leadership in Catholic education.

## Consulting Services and Speakers

Workshops and seminars supporting the formation of faculty and school leaders are available through the center to evaluate current programs or develop new initiatives, cultivate effective school boards, improve school culture, increase advancement efforts, institute staff evaluation and growth processes, access technology priorities, or to learn to use analytics to support student outcomes and increase student retention.

## Entrepreneurial Leadership Seminar

Our Entrepreneurial Leadership Seminar works with superintendents' offices to identify a group of principals to meet at Fordham several times during the year. The series offers guidance and strategies to help these principals stay true to their schools' missions.

## President + Principal Round Table

This lecture series promotes the relationship between presidents and principals of Catholic High schools through the lens of current educational and faith identity issues.

## Professional Development for Non-Public Schools

The center, in conjunction with the GSE Center for Educational Partnerships, offers professional development programs via government grants.
