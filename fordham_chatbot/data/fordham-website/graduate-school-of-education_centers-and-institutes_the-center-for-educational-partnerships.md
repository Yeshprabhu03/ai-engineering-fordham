![Center for Educational Partnerships logo](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/edpartner_logo_hands.jpg)

Since its establishment in 2006, Fordham’s Center for Educational Partnerships has earned a reputation as one of the City’s most innovative and increasingly influential resources of its kind by promoting student achievement in Pre-K to Grade 12 schools and by leveraging multi-tiered collaboration between an institution of higher education and school systems as the essential community link.

In so doing, Fordham’s Graduate School of Education has immersed itself into the educational landscape of New York City Schools through the CEP, which serves over 550,000 students, 8,800 teachers, and thousands of parents/families throughout New York City and the greater metropolitan area.
