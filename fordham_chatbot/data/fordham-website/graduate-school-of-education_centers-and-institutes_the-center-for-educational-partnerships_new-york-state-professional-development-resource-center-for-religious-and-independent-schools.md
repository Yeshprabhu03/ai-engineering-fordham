# New York State Professional Development Resource Center for Religious and Independent Schools

The Professional Development Resource Center (PDRC) for Religious and Independent Schools offers administrators and teachers access to the many benefits of in-person and virtual learning opportunities that are aligned to Fordham’s standards for rigorous academic endeavors, reflective pedagogy, and a commitment to social justice, personal responsibility, and equity for all learners.

## Professional Development Opportunities

We look forward to the new school year in supporting the education of the whole child - academically, socially and emotionally. We will continue to provide a balance of in-person professional development, while continuing to benefit from Live Webinars, Self-directed learning opportunities, and professional resources via our Monthly Newsletter. Please view and register for upcoming events by checking the links on the side of this page.
