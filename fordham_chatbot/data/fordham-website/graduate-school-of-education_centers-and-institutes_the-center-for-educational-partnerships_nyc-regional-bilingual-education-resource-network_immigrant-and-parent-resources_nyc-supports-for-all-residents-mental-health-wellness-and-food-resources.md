- Do not receive meal assistance from other providers (incl. Meals on Wheels or God's Love We Deliver); and
- You are unable to afford meal delivery or grocery delivery.

Households that qualify may place an order once every two days. Each order will contain two days of meals (4 meals per person in the household, but no household will receive more than 8 meals per delivery).
