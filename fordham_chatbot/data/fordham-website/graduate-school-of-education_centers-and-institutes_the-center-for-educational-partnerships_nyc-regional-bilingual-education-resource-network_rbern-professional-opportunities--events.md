**January 7, 2025** - [ELs and ELs with Disabilities Book Study: UDL Now! 3rd Edition A Teacher's Guide to Applying Universal Design for Learning.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe4VMIl7A11pVfRFdX5y3Ci0MGgsChSMsdLHHQBI3T8KpbXGw/viewform) The purpose of this book study is to create an online PLC that supports the use of UDL to create lessons that address the unique needs of English Learners (ELs) and ELs with disabilities to meet grade-level standards while developing English literacy skills. The UDL lesson planning format will support ELs to become proficient communicators and independent thinkers, while providing more time for teachers to work efficiently and responsibly. We will meet once a month for four months, beginning in October 2024, to review, analyze, and discuss how to implement key features from each of the eight chapters into differentiated lesson planning and student-centered classroom practices. Audience: ENL, Bilingual, Special Education teachers, ENL Coordinators, IEP teachers and Administrators. 3:00 p.m. - 4:30 p.m.

Combinations involves explicit instruction in sentence-level routines (boundaries, hook it up/set it up, stretch it and parallel revision) that develop students’ written and oral language, content knowledge and reading comprehension simultaneously. These multiplier strategies are especially powerful for English learners because they also teach how the English language works. Please join us for this 6-day workshop aligned with structured literacy and the science of reading and based on ideas from our new book, Sentence Strategies for Multilingual Learners: Advancing Academic Literacy through Combinations (Routledge, 2023). You will learn how and why Combinations works to develop high levels of academic literacy for all students. You will leave with sentence-level activities for immediate use that tap into and draw upon students’ cultural and linguistic assets and that provide access to deep content learning and English language development concurrently for all students. This workshop is designed for teachers of multilingual learners in all content areas in grades 3-12, including bilingual and co-teaching pairs. Participants are expected to attend all sessions. Audience: Teachers of English Learners grades 3-12. 9:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.

Nearly half of all children and youth in the United States have encountered trauma, violence, or chronic stress due to abuse, neglect, or other household challenges. In addition to these alarming statistics, many multilingual learners and their families face unique disruptions, including living in war zones, experiencing persecution, undertaking perilous journeys to seek safety in the U.S., family separation, fear of deportation, and homelessness. Despite extensive resources for counselors addressing trauma, there is a noticeable gap in materials designed specifically for educators working with multilingual learners who have experienced ACEs. This three-part interactive series will address this gap by presenting evidence-based strategies, tools, and examples of instructional and school-wide practices. The three sessions will focus on recognizing and leveraging the strengths and assets of these students and their families to foster a supportive and empowering educational environment.

June 6, 2024 - Proven Practices to Support Multilingual Learners in Making Academic Writing Strides. Multilingual learners require informed, explicit, and systematic instruction that addresses their English language and written response needs. At all levels of proficiency, English learners depend upon every teacher to serve as the over-the-shoulder writing coach their parents cannot be. Dr. Kinsella carefully explains, justifies, and models research-informed writing instruction imperatives for educators serving English learners. Participants leave with detailed guidance and practical classroom-tested lesson resources to facilitate professional learning and implementation. Among other writing essential components, participants will learn to Introduce and unpack a model paper exemplifying the critical elements of a writing type; provide a student-friendly scoring guide that serves as a productive teaching tool; frontload rhetorical conventions and academic language for specific writing types; design academic interactions that guide students in applying vocabulary, syntax, and rhetorical devices they can apply in subsequent written work.
