![Anderson from GRE](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/Colt_Anderson_240x240_1.jpg)

C. Colt Anderson received his Ph.D. with a concentration in historical theology from Marquette University in 1998 and his M.A. from the University of Georgia in religious studies. He teaches courses in the history of Christian Spirituality, ecclesiology, and leadership. His research focuses on the intersection between three areas of concern: the communication of the Gospel, how to reform the church, and the importance of an eschatological perspective. The early Franciscan movement has served as a touchstone even as he has turned to address contemporary issues such as the rise of religious nationalism and the causes of the Catholic sexual abuse crisis.

Professor Anderson has published three monographs: *A Call to Piety: St. Bonaventure’s Collations on the Six Days* (Franciscan Press, 2002), *Christian Eloquence* (Hillenbrand Press, 2005), *The Great Catholic Reformers: From Gregory the Great to Dorothy Day* (Paulist Press, 2007). *The Great Catholic Reformers* won a Catholic Press Association award for history in 2007. He co-edited with Greg Peterson *Priesthood and Holy Orders in the Middle Ages *(Leiden: Brill, 2015). Dr. Anderson’s most recent book was a collaboration with David Elcott, Tobias Cremer, and Volker Haarmann. The volume, *Faith, Nationalism, and the Future of Liberal Democracy* (University of Notre Dame Press, 2021), won the Bronze Award for political science from the Indies Forward Book of the Year Awards and an honorable mention from The Catholic Media Association.

Professor Anderson has served as the Vice President of Academic Affairs at the Washington Theological Union and as the Academic Dean of the Graduate School of Religion at Fordham University. Prior to his academic career, he was a theological consultant to the Democratic Party of Georgia and an award-winning scriptwriter and film producer.
