Professor Cattaro is currently the Executive Director of The Center for Catholic School Leadership and Faith-Based Education, and former chair of the Division of Educational Leadership, Administration, and Policy, in the Graduate School of Education at Fordham University.

Appointed by Pope Francis as a consultor on the Vatican's Congregation for Catholic Education, Cattaro serves on the editorial boards of *Education and Urban Society*,* International Journal of Educational Reform* and the Governing Board of *Journal of Catholic Education*. He writes, teaches, speaks, and conducts research nationally and internationally, on governance issues associated with faith-based schools, executive leadership of faith- based schools, non-public school policy, and international faith-based education. Cattaro also currently serves on numerous national and international committees and boards, including The Pontifical Foundation of Scholas founded by Pope Francis, the Scientific Council of Advanced Studies at the University of Santa Maria Assunta, and as a chair of the steering committee of the World Congress of Catholic Education. He is a permanent observer for the Office of Catholic Education at the United Nations, and is the only American to sit on the Council of European Catholic Education.

Cattaro has made presentations at the United Nations' UNESCO in Paris and at the Vatican, plus at universities on all five continents, and to professional organizations such as the American Educational Research Association (AERA), the University Council for Educational Administration (UCEA), and the National Catholic Educational Association (NCEA). He made recent keynote presentations at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Australian Catholic University, and the University of Strasbourg.

In addition, Professor Cattaro has served as a mentor to doctoral candidates for more than 60 Ph.D. educational leadership dissertations. His former students reside on every continent, among them bishops, university and college presidents, deans, superintendents of schools, and school principals. Cattaro's latest upcoming book, on the 50th anniversary of Gravissium Educationes, is also being revised for other publications, including diocesan educational leadership studies for NCEA and articles in *Education Catholic, *a publication of the Vatican's Congregation for Catholic Education.

Previously, Cattaro was a Catholic school administrator for nearly 20 years, and earned his Ed.D. at Teachers’ College at Columbia University in New York City.
