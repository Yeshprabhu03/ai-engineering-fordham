In addition to my interest in mathematics and statistics anxiety, I have also worked in previous institutions with some faculty members in counselor education, including research related to career transitions.

In addition, having a background in statistics and research means that I am often able to collaborate with other faculty members in terms of setting up the research design and working with both qualitative and quantitative research. It allows me to work with interdisciplinary research projects.
