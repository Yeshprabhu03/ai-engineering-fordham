Phillip A. Smith is an assistant professor in the Educational Leadership, Administration and Policy (ELAP) Division of Fordham Graduate School of Education (GSE). Smith joins Fordham from Teachers College at Columbia University, where he completed his Ph.D. in educational leadership and a postdoctoral fellowship. A seasoned educational leader and professor at both the undergraduate and graduate levels, he has also served as a contributory member of instructional teams on doctoral-level courses.

Smith’s research includes examining how the racial identities and lived experiences of Black male K-12 public and independent school leaders informed their professional lives and leadership. The research builds theory and formulates a new and comprehensive definition and typology of Black male school leadership. His dissertation, entitled “Leading While Black and Male: A Phenomenology of Black Male School Leaders,” was awarded the Division A (administration, organization & leadership) Outstanding Dissertation Award, and the Division G (social context of education) Distinguished Dissertation Award from the American Educational Research Association (AERA). Smith will be creating a framework and model for mentoring grounded in a Black leadership epistemology, aimed at supporting Black men in educational leadership. His other research interests include exploring the intersection of race and gender in educational leadership to improve diversity and representation across the leadership workforce.
