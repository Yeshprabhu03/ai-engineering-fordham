The Graduate School of Social Service offers advanced standing M.S.W. program admission to students who have earned a Bachelor of Social Work (B.S.W.) or completed the generalist phase of a CSWE-accredited M.S.W. program.

Through this accelerated pathway, students can earn their [M.S.W. degree](http://fordham.edu/msw) in **as few as nine months** as a full-time student and **save over $30,000**. Fordham GSS also offers a part-time advanced standing plan of study, which can be completed in two academic years and is designed for working students.

## Advanced Standing M.S.W. Coursework and Field Education

#### Choose a Domain

Fordham M.S.W. students are also offered the opportunity to choose between four specialized domains to focus their coursework. The chosen domain should reflect the student’s career aspirations:

- Individuals and Families
- Organizations and Community
- Evaluation
- Policy Practice and Advocacy

#### Specialized Practice Certificates (SPCs)

In addition, Fordham offers Specialized Practice Certificates (SPCs) in two categories:

- Health
- Crisis and Resilience

SPCs come with specific coursework and training that will help you stand out in the job market if you wish to pursue work in one of these areas. [You can learn more about SPCs here.](/graduate-school-of-social-service/academics/master-of-social-work/)

### Advanced Standing Field Education

Advanced standing MSW students must complete one field education internship (500 hours) alongside their academic coursework. Fordham’s partnerships with thousands of agencies nationwide allow students to find fieldwork that prepares them for any career they choose—whether it be in [school social work](/graduate-school-of-social-service/admissions/fordham-gssnyc-public-schools-collaborative-fellowship/), [policy reform](/graduate-school-of-social-service/academics/master-of-social-work/united-nations-internship-experience/), or [immigration advocacy](/graduate-school-of-social-service/academics/unique-to-fordham/her-migrant-hub/).

Your specialist year field placement has intentionality. You collaborate with our field team to find a placement that aligns with your career interests and focuses on a population you want to serve.

## Is an M.S.W. Worth It After a B.S.W.?

Completing your B.S.W. degree is an incredible accomplishment. It will open doors for entry-level positions in social work and allow you to gain experience in the field. This experience will be invaluable for your career.

An M.S.W. degree will allow you to take the next step in your journey. The Master of Social Work designation will increase your compensation and skillset, and allow you to pursue licensure.

### The National Numbers

[According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/emp/chart-unemployment-earnings-education.htm), the median weekly earnings for those with a graduate degree is $1,737, while bachelor’s graduates earn $1,493 per week. This adds up to an extra $976 per month, $11,712 per year, and almost **half a million dollars** in a lifetime.

As an advanced standing student, **you enter a master’s program with half the work and cost behind you.** In just one academic year, you can expand your knowledge, boost your earning potential, and acquire a network of Fordham alumni eager to assist you in navigating your career.

## M.S.W. Advanced Standing Admissions Requirements

Aside from having already earned a Bachelor of Social Work (B.S.W.) degree or completed the generalist phase of a CSWE-accredited M.S.W. program, advanced standing M.S.W. admission requirements are similar to our traditional M.S.W. program requirements.
