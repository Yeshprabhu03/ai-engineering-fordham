# Hybrid Master of Social Work


## In Collaboration with Molloy University

Fordham’s online hybrid master of social work (M.S.W.) option on Long Island, is a collaborative program with Molloy University that combines traditional face-to-face classes at Molloy’s campus with online courses.

While our traditional Fordham/Molloy Collaborative Program—which offers face-to-face classes at both Molloy University on Long Island and Fordham’s Manhattan campus—will continue, this online hybrid M.S.W. option enables more Long Islanders to conveniently obtain a Fordham University MSW degree. We offer full-time, part-time and Advanced Standing [plans of study](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/gss/msw/#plansofstudytext) with both fall and spring start dates.

### A Fordham M.S.W., Without the Commute

Hear from a few of our students and alumni why the hybrid program was right for them and why it could be right for you.
