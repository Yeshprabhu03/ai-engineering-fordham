At Fordham GSS, we value hands-on experience just as much as in-class learning. In the Fordham GSS London Summer Program, M.S.W. students also complete site visits to historic settlement houses located in NYC and London. The program highlights the rich history of the settlement house movement in London and NYC and its role in the formation of the social work profession and social welfare. Read more about our trips to [NYC settlement houses](https://gss.news.fordham.edu/students/2023-fordham-london-summer-program-nyc-days-2-and-3/) and [London settlement houses](https://gss.news.fordham.edu/students/london-calling-students-take-toynbee-hall-and-tower-bridge/).

Faculty will facilitate structured opportunities for students to integrate their community-based and classroom experiences and learning and enhance the international comparative nature of their study abroad.
