The mission of the Palliative Care Fellowship is to educate and train social workers to deliver high-quality palliative and end-of-life care to individuals and families, with cultural competence and respect for patient self-determination, and to contribute specialist palliative social workers to the workforce.

## Fellowship Components

The Palliative Care Fellowship is for Specialist year students in the on-campus program and includes the following components:

- An internship working with seriously ill individuals and their family members in inpatient, outpatient, community-based, and hospice care settings
- Two course electives:
- Palliative Social Work
- Grief, Loss, and Bereavement
- A dedicated Field Seminar led by an experienced palliative social worker
- Support and mentoring from the Palliative Care Fellowship Director
- Half-day workshop in the Fall and one in the Spring by leaders in palliative care
- Small scholarship

Selection as a Palliative Care Fellow is competitive. The Fellows are carefully screened to select students who are clinically and academically strong and committed to a career working with seriously ill individuals and their families. The application is submitted in January in the year prior to completing the M.S.W. program.
