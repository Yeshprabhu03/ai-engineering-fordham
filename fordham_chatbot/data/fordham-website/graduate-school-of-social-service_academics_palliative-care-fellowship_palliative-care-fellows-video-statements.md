# Palliative Care Fellows Video Statements

The Fordham University Graduate School of Social Service is proud to showcase our Palliative Care Fellows through video statements gathered upon completion of the program. In these videos, Fellows explain what drew them to palliative care, their experiences in their internships, and how the Fellowship prepared them for a meaningful career in the field.
