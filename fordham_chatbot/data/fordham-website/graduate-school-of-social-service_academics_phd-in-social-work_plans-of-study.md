## The Importance of Representation

Doctoral graduate Vanessa Castellanos, Ph.D., is a first-generation Latina college student—and while coming up in higher education, she didn't see many professors who looked like her. Now, after graduating with her Ph.D. in Social Work, Castellanos has accepted an assistant professor position at California State University, Dominguez Hills. Her mission is to mentor students through the imposter syndrome that is exacerbated by new experiences, such as the college culture.
