## Your Future – Found at Fordham


As a Fordham GSS student, you’ll complete your education in the heart of one of the greatest cities in the world, learning from a distinguished faculty of social work pioneers, Fulbright scholars, and world-class innovators on the fringe of social work’s biggest breakthroughs.

Along with offering a top-ranked social work graduate education, Fordham GSS prides itself on giving students experiences in and out of the classroom they won’t get anywhere else.

London is calling! As a Master of Social Work (M.S.W.) student at Fordham, you can complete part of your education across the pond in London, England. In this three-week immersive program, you’ll take up to two courses, earning up to six credits toward your M.S.W., while exploring some of London and NYC’s most historic settlement houses and how they impact their communities.

Additionally, you can extend your London stay and complete part of your specialist year field internship abroad at one of Fordham’s partner organizations during the fall semester. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to immerse yourself in London’s culture and gain an international perspective to have in your social work skillset as you head into graduation.

As a student enrolled in GSS’s MSW on-campus program at the Lincoln Center or Westchester campuses, you can study global policy and learn from the world’s top social work leaders through field placement in collaboration with the United Nations.

In 2012, Fordham University became a non-governmental organization (NGO) associated with The United Nations Department of Global Communications (DGC) Civil Society Unit. Through this partnership, GSS offers advanced year MSW students the chance to participate as representatives of associated NGOs in official United Nations events and briefings.

Founded in 2021 by Fordham GSS Professors Dana Alonzo and Marciana Popescu, Her Migrant Hub is a grant-funded initiative for women asylum seekers, by women asylum seekers. The Her Migrant Hub project website partners with local organizations to provide them with the mental health and health care resources they need while navigating the migration process.

Select M.S.W. students are chosen each year to work alongside the Her Migrant Hub team to expand access to these resources, promote events and training webinars, and conduct research to inform the project’s innovations moving forward.
