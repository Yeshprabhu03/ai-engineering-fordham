**Fraudulent Documents and Omission Policy**Fordham University Graduate School of Social Service has a clearly defined policy concerning the submission of fraudulent documents and the omission of information in support of an application for admission, which is detailed as follows:

The submission of an application for admission, accompanied by supporting documents such as transcripts, test scores, references, personal statements, and resumes that are forged, fraudulent, altered from the original, materially incomplete, obtained under false pretenses, or otherwise misleading is strictly prohibited by the Graduate School of Social Service. The omission of essential information from an application is considered a misrepresentation, which impedes the Admissions Review Committee's capacity to perform a thorough evaluation and is therefore prohibited.

Violations of this policy may lead to: administrative withdrawal of the application, inability to submit a re-application, rescinding of an admissions decision, administrative withdrawal or dismissal from the MSW program, forfeiture of the application fee, forfeiture of the enrollment deposit and forfeiture of a tuition refund.
