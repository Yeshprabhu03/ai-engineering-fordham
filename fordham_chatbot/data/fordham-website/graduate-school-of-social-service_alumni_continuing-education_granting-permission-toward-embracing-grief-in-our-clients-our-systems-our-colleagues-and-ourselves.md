In modern Western society, grief is not granted

*permission*to exist, to be felt, without barriers. Grief of all types, including grief through death as well as grief engendered by serious illness, ambiguous losses, and other life challenges and transitions, is unavoidable within the human experience and is often excruciating. However, it is rarely sufficiently recognized or supported. By considering and evaluating grief experiences through the lens of their access to*permission*, clinicians can collectively imagine and promote inclusivity in grief.*Permission*will be presented as both a conceptual framework and a clinical tool. We will explore its micro- and macro-level applications across practice settings and populations, and its utility for both professional and layperson engagement. Building from this foundation, together we will imagine and set intentions toward building healthcare systems and social institutions that embrace healthier and more supportive narratives about grief. -

**Rennie Bimman, BSW, MSW, LICSW, RSW (i)**Rennie Bimman engages in clinical practice, research, and education to address grief, especially grief that has unmet needs. She holds a BSW from McGill University and an MSW from the University of Toronto, specializing in Gerontology with a Collaborative Specialization in Aging, Palliative, and Supportive Care Across the Life Course. In her clinical work throughout Canada and the U.S. she has supported individuals and families in their most vulnerable moments across the life course, including older adults with dementia and their caregivers, families experiencing the serious illness and death of a child, parents and grandparents enduring perinatal loss, adults and their families navigating terminal illnesses on a newly established palliative care unit, and pregnant and parenting young mothers grieving the nondeath losses of abortion or child removal. Her research includes investigating disenfranchised grief of caregivers and clinicians supporting patients with advanced liver disease, exploring the inclusion of persons with dementia in decision-making regarding their care and developing communication interventions to improve this, designing evidence-informed bereaved caregiver support programs and intervention approaches, and identifying the unique contributions of gerontological social workers. She is currently pursuing a PhD in Social Work at McGill University, investigating the needs of intergenerational family systems navigating pregnancy and infant loss.
