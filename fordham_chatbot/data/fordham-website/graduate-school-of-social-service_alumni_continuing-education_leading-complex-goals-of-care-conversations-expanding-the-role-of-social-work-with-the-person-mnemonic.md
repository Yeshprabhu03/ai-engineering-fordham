High quality goals-of-care conversations are essential to aligning treatment with what matters most to patients living with serious and life-limiting illness. It introduces the PERSON mnemonic (Perception, Explore, Relate, Sources of worry, Outline, Notify) as a practical, teachable tool for structuring complex goals-of-care discussions that surface values, hopes, and worries while translating them into clear next steps.

The class emphasizes how social workers’ skills in biopsychosocial-spiritual assessment, communication, and family systems uniquely position them to lead these conversations and expand their role beyond being seen only as providers of “emotional support”—a label that, while valuable, is frequently minimized or not viewed as clinically credible. Participants will learn how to apply PERSON step by step, practice language they can use at the bedside, and strengthen their ability to navigate uncertainty, emotion, and conflict. By situating PERSON as a tool that highlights social work’s clinical expertise, the course supports participants in recognizing their leadership potential and advancing their role within interdisciplinary teams.
