The International Military Social Work Consortium (IMilSWC) is an international group of military social work educators, practitioners, and researchers interested in supporting current or past military service members and their families through the development and sharing of knowledge about military social work best practices, education/training, and research.

The Consortium was formed following the first inaugural roundtable IMilSW Conference which was held on April 24-26, 2019 at the West Point Thayer Hotel. The conference, organized and sponsored by Fordham University Graduate School of Social Service, brought together invited subject matter experts in military social work from sixteen countries to share their knowledge about the role of social workers within their country's military and to develop a plan to further the development and dissemination of international military social work education, practice, policy, and research.
