He began his social work career in the South African military as a unit social worker, mostly with Naval personnel in Simonstown. After seven years he took up a position to start the Social Work Research & Development department, which rapidly grew to five full-time social work researchers, and then to start the Military Health Research Centre.

Since leaving the military, his attention has focused on developing ecological and interactional resilience theory and studying and promoting the resilience of young people in transition from care into young adulthood (i.e., youth transitions).
