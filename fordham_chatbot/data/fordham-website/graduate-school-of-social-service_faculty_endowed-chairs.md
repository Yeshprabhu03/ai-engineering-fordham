Endowed chairs enlarge the faculty and populate Fordham University with top academic talent, enabling us to attract distinguished scholars who are dedicated to teaching. Additionally, these endowed positions also allow faculty members to pay closer attention to each student's development, which is vital to our student-centered mission.

[Dr. Shirley Gatenio Gabel](/graduate-school-of-social-service/faculty/full-time-faculty-profiles/shirley-gatenio-gabel/), Quaranta Chair for Social Justice for Children

The purpose of the Quaranta chair is to increase and enhance opportunities for children who are deprived of the basic elements of healthy development and well-being. The core functions of this chair will be realized through research, information dissemination and advocacy in child welfare. The chair’s primary goal is to be a focus of change for a fragmented system of child and family services with the expectation that these changes will influence the development of healthy children, families and urban communities.

[Dr. Janna Heyman](/graduate-school-of-social-service/faculty/full-time-faculty-profiles/janna-c-heyman/), Henry C. Ravazzin Chair in Gerontology

The Henry C. Ravazzin Chair in Gerontology was established in 2002 through the Henry C. Ravazzin Fund, which also founded the Ravazzin Center on Aging in 1995. This chair recognizes the long-term commitment of Fordham University's Graduate School of Social Service (GSS) to understand and strengthen the social work role in meeting the needs of older adults and their families.

[Dr. Fuhua Zhai](/graduate-school-of-social-service/faculty/full-time-faculty-profiles/fuhua-zhai/), Thea Bowman Chair in Social Research

The Thea Bowman Chair in Social Research was founded to support and increase research and scholarship within the Fordham University Graduate School of Social Service (GSS). The Chair works to support faculty members in seeking funded research opportunities and increase the productivity and impact of their research and scholarship. This is supported in a variety of ways, including but not limited to organizing and sponsoring forums, development workshops, inviting experts to instructional sessions, and peer support initiatives. A core function of the Chair is to guide faculty in their efforts to seek both internal and external research funding. The goal is to increase research that advances the design of social programs and policies contributing to the well-being of individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities.
