Impact of dating/relationship violence


Intersection of violence and HIV risk behaviors among inner-city minority adolescent females -
After earning her Masters of Social Work Degree (MSW) from Clark Atlanta University in Atlanta, Georgia, Binta Alleyne-Green worked for a number of years as a social worker at a private social service agency. However, her passion for research prompted her to return to school to obtain her PhD, which she did from the University of Tennessee, Knoxille in 2007.

Currently an Assistant Professor at Fordham University Graduate School of Social Service, Dr. Alleyne-Green's research focuses on the impact of relationship violence on risk behaviors among minority adolescent females. She has been the recipient of a number of funding awards including a Diversity Supplement form the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA), a First Year Faculty Grant from Fordham University to examine the "Impact of Partners' Reproductive Control on Reproductive Decision Making Among Adolescent Girls With A History of Dating Violence", as well as a Faculty Research Development Award to examine the "Impact of Biological Fathers On Dating Violence and Sexual Risk Behaviors Among A National Sample of Adolescent Females."

To date, Dr. Alleyne-Green has published a number of articles that examine the impact of relationship violence on sexual and other risk behaviors among minority adolescent females.
