Dana Marlowe received her PhD in 2000 from Fordham University Graduate School of Social Service; a Master of Social Work degree from the State University of New York at Buffalo (1992); and a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology from the State University of New York at Binghamton (1990). She has been a Clinical Associate Professor at Fordham GSS since 2005. She teaches Generalist Practice I and II, Social Justice: Practice With Organizations and Communities, Social Welfare Policy and Services, and Social Policy Analysis, Advocacy, and Practice. Dr. Marlowe became an Associate Clinical Professor at GSS in 2014.

Dr. Marlowe has professional practice experience in both clinical and administrative areas. Her professional practice has been in the field of mental health and health, specifically in the field of cancer and HIV/AIDS. She also worked with helping the children affected by the Chernobyl nuclear disaster from 1992 through 1995, making three humanitarian missions to Belarus.

In 1995 Dr. Marlowe began working as the Program Coordinator for the Nyack Hospital Pediatric AIDS Program, providing both direct services and administrative oversight. She became the Clinical Coordinator of Together Our Unity Can Heal, an AIDS service organization in 1998. In 2000, she returned to Nyack Hospital, again providing program coordination to the Pediatric AIDS Program. From 2001 until 2004, Dr. Marlowe was the Coordinator of the Nyack Hospital Family Centered HIV Program. During her time at Nyack Hospital, she served on Ryan White Title I and II Steering Committees. She also implemented an HIV counseling and testing program for children and adolescents in foster care. Her dissertation, written while she was earning her doctorate at Fordham University, examined factors affecting social workers’ decision to breach confidentiality of HIV-positive clients in order to warn third parties. Since 2002 Dr. Marlowe has been a trainer for the New York City HIV/AIDS Services Administration, teaching workshops in HIV and families and cultural competence.

Her current research is examining cultural competence and working with individuals living with HIV/AIDS.
