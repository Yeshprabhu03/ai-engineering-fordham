Dr. Coleman received his MSW from Smith College and his PhD from University of California, Berkeley in 2000. He combines a psychotherapy/clinical social work background and subsequent training as a social scientist. His research grew out of his strong clinical interests and focused on theoretical orientation of therapists, treatment of depression, PTSD, and psychotherapy process. In recent years he has developed a primary focus on suicide and suicide prevention. He has received research funding from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration for evaluation research, and from the Lois and Samuel Silberman Fund for a study of gender role and suicide in older adults.

Dr. Coleman teaches advanced clinical practice courses and a philosophy of science course in the doctoral program. Previously he was on the faculty of Portland State University where he was director of the PhD program and taught clinical practice and statistics courses.

Dr. Coleman provides methodological and statistical services to other social and health scientists. His areas of specialization include small sample statistical procedures, measurement, and advanced linear models. Consultation projects have included: National Institute of Disabilities and Rehabilitation funded studies of work-life balance for families of children with mental health needs and of stigmatization of children with mental health problems; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration funded research on children’s mental health services; research design and statistical consultation to the Clinical Research unit of Shriner’s Hospital Portland. Services provided include research design, statistical planning, running and interpreting analyses, and assisting with grant applications, conference presentations, reports and peer-reviewed publications.
