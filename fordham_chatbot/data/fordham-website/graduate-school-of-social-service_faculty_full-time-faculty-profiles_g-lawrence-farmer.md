G. Lawrence Farmer, MSW, Ph.D., is a Professor and Director of the Doctoral Program at Fordham University’s Graduate School of Social Service. He earned his PhD. in Social Welfare at Florida International University, his M.S.W., and BA in Psychology and Biomedical Ethics at the University of Pittsburgh. His scholarly interests center on understanding those factors that promote the well-being of youth. For example, the role the social worker can plan to strengthen the social environment’s ability to promote the development of non-cognitive competencies in youth that will promote positive youth development. Additionally, Dr. Farmer has interests in psychometrics, implementation science, and advanced quantitative statistical methods. He is currently in partnership with the Urban Assembly (
