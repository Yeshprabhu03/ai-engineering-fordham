Jenn M. Lilly, PhD, LMSW, is an Assistant Professor in the Graduate School of Social Service at Fordham University. Her research and teaching focus on storytelling for social justice, with an emphasis on participatory, arts-based, and qualitative methods. Most of her work addresses issues impacting Latine migrant communities, building on more than a decade of practice experience in the U.S. and Latin America. Before joining academia, Dr. Lilly worked in the non-profit sector in roles spanning community organizing, program management, positive youth development, and participatory action research in settings including Chicago, New Orleans, New York, Chiapas (Mexico), and Lake Atitlán (Guatemala).


Dr. Lilly’s scholarship centers on two interconnected areas: promoting youth mental and sexual health, and advancing digital narrative media as a tool for health equity and advocacy. Guided by a commitment to making research meaningful, accessible, and community-driven, she partners with young people to co-create research products and intervention strategies that address issues of concern to them. Her current project develops a narrative media mobile app designed to empower Latine parents to support their daughters’ mental health and prevent suicide. She also leads a line of research examining representations of social workers in television dramas. Her work has been published in leading journals, including Families in Society and Children and Youth Services Review, and she has co-produced multiple media projects that amplify the voices and experiences of Latine migrant communities. Dr. Lilly's research has been supported by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Fahs-Beck Fund for Research and Experimentation, and National Research Center on Hispanic Children & Families.

As an educator, Dr. Lilly builds a vibrant classroom community where students feel safe to take risks, connect deeply with one another, and form relationships that last beyond the course. She teaches across the social work curriculum—including Contemporary Social Policy, Advanced Integrated Policy Practice, Social Work Practice with Individuals, Families, and Groups Across the Lifespan, Social Work with Organizations and Communities, and Qualitative Inquiry in Social Work Practice—and finds teaching both energizing and inspiring, continually learning alongside her students. Her classes combine intellectual rigor with warmth and collaboration, inviting every student to engage fully and contribute meaningfully to a shared educational journey. -
