Dr. Marciana Popescu is a Professor at Fordham University, Graduate School of Social Service (GSS), and a Fulbright Specialist on migration policy (2018-2023). In 2016/2017, Dr. Popescu was a Fulbright Senior Scholar in Austria, conducting research on migration policies within the EU space, and their impact on women asylum seekers or refugees. Since 2018, Dr. Popescu is a member of the UN-NGO Committee on Migration, working on global and local migration policies. Her research focuses on forced migration and gender, forced migration and health/mental health, and violence against women; as well as community capacity building and human rights/women’s rights. Dr. Popescu authored multiple publications on migration, women’s rights, and international development; and over the past 3 years worked closely on migration and health/mental health , exploring the impact of the pandemic on women migrants, and the impact of forced migration on the health and mental health of asylum seekers. In 2018, Dr. Popescu was selected as a Social Innovation fellow, working on a research project focusing on the integration of students with a forced migration background in higher education institutions; she continues to research the role of higher education institutions in addressing forced migration challenges, and engaging with communities to create safe spaces for refugees. Dr. Popescu is directing the

*Her Migrant Hub*project ([www.hermigranthub.org](http://www.hermigranthub.org)) together with Dr. Alonzo, a community-based initiative focusing on increasing access and utilization of health and mental health care services for women asylum seekers in NYC.Dr. Popescu is currently pursuing a law degree at Fordham Law School (expected graduation date: December 2024), with a concentration in International Comparative and Foreign Law/International Law and Justice. She was one of the selected

[Crowley Scholars](https://leitnercenter.org/news/the-leitner-center-announces-the-2022-23-class-of-crowley-scholars-5/)in 2022-2023, working on a research project focused on the emergency humanitarian evacuations from Afghanistan ([https://www.leitnercenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/FINAL-LeitnerCenter_Afghanistan-Evacuations_WEB.pdf](https://www.leitnercenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/FINAL-LeitnerCenter_Afghanistan-Evacuations_WEB.pdf)); and volunteered with the International Refugee Assistance Program (IRAP) on two separate projects (Spring 2022 and Spring 2023). Working across disciplines and across countries on migration policies and human rights, Dr. Popescu hopes to contribute to interdisciplinary, innovative solutions to the complex challenges faced by people with lived experiences of forced migration, and prepare social work students to participate at local, national, and international levels, in shaping global agendas and promoting justice and human rights. -
