Dr. Perez’s research focuses on the adaptation of immigrants and refugees to US society. In particular, she is concerned with adverse psychosocial effects of dissonant acculturation in families. Her doctoral research found that linguistic-acculturation and whom adolescent participants spent time with were positively correlated with reported well-being. Dr. Perez is also interested in developing robust cross-cultural methods that inform social work practice and research.

At Fordham, she teaches Human Behavior in the Social Environment and Empowerment Practices With Immigrants and Refugees. Professor Perez’ courses are both content-based and skill-based. Her students are encouraged to learn through active participation in assignments designed to help them be better writers, communicators, critical thinkers and better practitioners.

Her research and teaching are informed by her interdisciplinary education and experience in the social sciences and in business administration. In addition to two master’s degrees and a doctorate from the University Of Chicago, and an MBA from the University of Michigan, she has clinical experience working with acculturating adults, children, and couples around issues of subjective well-being, psychological distress, and familial violence.

Prior to entering social work, she held leadership positions in finance, marketing, and research for large corporations. Many of the skills she learned are transferable to developing and effectively marketing social work programs in underserved culturally diverse communities. The sum of her experiences help her to understand and bridge macro and micro social work research and practice issues affecting individuals and their families.
