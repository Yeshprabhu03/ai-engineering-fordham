She also did studies on Chinese Americans caregivers’ burden and causal attributions of schizophrenia, Chinese Americans’ help-seeking behaviors and barriers to mental health treatment, integration of primary care and mental health services, and the sociocultural contexts in shaping divorced women’s stress and coping in Hong Kong.
