# Preparing for College

**You can prepare for college well before your senior year.**

**Your entire high school experience plays an important role in preparing you for the college admissions process. The courses you take can help you figure out what subjects you like. The activities you participate in can help you gain experience, such as leadership and strong communication skills. The people you meet can show you different career paths that you might want to explore.**

## Reveal the Real You

The decisions you make in high school also show college admission counselors a bit more about you.

- Did you take courses that challenged you? That shows a desire to learn and push yourself academically.
- Did you find a club that you’re really passionate about? That shows them your interests and your dedication.
- Did you improve a low grade? That shows your determination.

**Find Out What You Like**

Your experience in high school will also help you figure out what you’re looking for in a college.

- Where do you like to spend your free time—in the heart of a city or in a more quiet neighborhood?
- Do you like working closely with your teachers and mentors or do you prefer larger group experiences?
- Think about your learning style. Do you learn better when you watch someone else or do you prefer hands-on experience?

Answering questions like this will help you prioritize the colleges that are right for you.
