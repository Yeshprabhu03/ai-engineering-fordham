You could have the best application, but if you don’t submit it on time, it won’t matter. Submitting all your materials on time is very important.

The first step is knowing which decision option is best for you—Early Decision, Early Action, or Regular Decision.

**Fordham Application Deadlines**

Visit Fordham’s Undergraduate Admission site for deadlines for first-year student applicants.

## Early Decision

When you apply Early Decision, the college’s decision is binding, meaning that if you are accepted, you have to attend. So if you need to compare financial aid offers from schools or aren’t 100% sure of your top choice, Early Decision might not be right for you.

*Early Decision deadlines are usually in November. Decisions are usually sent out by January.*

## Early Action

If you feel prepared to submit your application but not to commit to attending a particular school, Early Action might be right for you. This path allows you to submit your application—and get a decision—earlier than most students without requiring a binding commitment from you.

“You should apply early if you’re ready and and can put your best foot forward in the process.” Patricia Peek, Ph.D., dean of undergraduate admission at Fordham, says.

*Early Action deadlines are also traditionally in November. Decisions are usually sent out by January.*

## Regular Decision

While you won’t hear a decision from schools until the spring if you apply Regular Decision, this option gives you the most time to prepare and the most flexibility in terms of choice.

*Applications are usually due in early January. Fordham sends out its decisions by April 1 and most schools by early April.*

## Rolling Decision

Some schools can share decisions throughout the cycle as applications are reviewed. For example at Fordham, transfer applicants will learn of their decision a few weeks after completing the application process.
