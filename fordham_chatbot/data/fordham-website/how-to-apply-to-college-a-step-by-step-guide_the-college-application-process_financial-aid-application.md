Financial aid deadlines often vary and differ slightly from admission application deadlines, so it’s important to keep track. You should not wait for an admission decision before starting the financial aid process.

“The admission process and the financial aid application process should be happening simultaneously,” Brian Ghanoo, Associate Vice President, Office of Student Financial Services at Fordham, said.

Almost all schools require students to fill out the FAFSA form, which stands for Free Application for Federal Student Aid. Colleges use the information on this form to help determine your eligibility for federal aid. Many schools, like Fordham, also require the CSS Profile, which allows schools to get a more detailed picture of your family’s financial means and determine eligibility for school funds. Check with the schools you're interested in to make sure you meet their specific requirements.

Here are some different types of financial aid to keep an eye out for:

**Merit-based scholarships:**Look for scholarships that are awarded based on your academic history or your skillset in a particular area, such as performance or STEM fields.**Need-based aid:**Many universities and colleges help you and your family cover the cost of college based on your financial situation. Make sure you fill out financial aid forms to qualify for this aid.**Loans:**Loans can help you and your family cover the net price of college. But remember: They have to be paid back, usually with interest, after you graduate.**Work-study:**The Federal Work-Study program can help you gain experience through working on campus while earning money that can be put toward your degree and other necessary expenses (books, food, etc.).**Payment plans:**While not technically a type of financial aid, a payment plan can help make paying for college easier by breaking the payment up over the school year.
