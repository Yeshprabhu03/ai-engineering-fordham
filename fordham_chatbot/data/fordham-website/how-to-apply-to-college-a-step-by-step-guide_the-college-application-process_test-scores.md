While some schools require you to submit standardized test scores, you may see others listed as “test-optional,” which means you are not required to submit an SAT or ACT score.

## Your Test Scores

If you’re looking at schools that do require test scores, you should think about taking the exams during the spring of your junior year in high school. This would allow you to take them again in the fall of your senior year if you are looking to get a higher score. You should also take a look at the student profile of each college you’re considering applying to, which will show the average test scores for the current class. That can give you an idea of what score you might need to get admitted.

If you’re applying to schools that make it optional to submit your test scores, here are a few tips to help you decide what to do.

**Are your test scores going to help your application?**If your scores are higher than the average test scores reported by the college or university, they could help show that you’re a good candidate for this school. If you’re worried that your scores might not showcase your best attributes, not submitting them might be the better route.**Are your scores going to show something new or different about you?**If there is something not demonstrated elsewhere in your application that your test scores can show college admission counselors, submitting them could help tell your story. If they’re not going to add value, think again about sending them.**Will it be held against you if I don't submit my test scores?**For the most part, test-optional schools won’t hold it against you if you don’t submit your scores—after all, they are optional! Be sure to check the requirements for each school you apply to so you can make sure that you don’t need to submit scores to gain access to specific programs and financial aid.
