In addition to looking at the academic pieces of your application, college admission counselors often look at what you did outside of the classroom.

Activities can also help you learn more about yourself. Maybe you find a new passion for engineering through a robotics club or maybe you find out you want to work in public office after participating in your school’s student government.

Your extracurricular or co-curricular activities can also provide admission counselors a sense of what you care about and what abilities you might have developed outside of the classroom.

To give them a more complete picture of your story, you also should include things you do outside of school. If you babysit or work a part-time job, for example, that can showcase your work ethic, dedication, service, and commitment.
