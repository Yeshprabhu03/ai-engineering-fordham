# Your Final College Choice

## You’re In! Now What?

**When you were deciding where to apply to college, you gave some thought to how you would become a part of your chosen school and what you would bring to that community. Now that you’ve been accepted, take time to think about how you will become a part of that school’s community, both socially and academically. **

## Pick a College that Makes You Feel at Home

Hopefully you have a sense of what it’s like to be on campus at each of the schools you’ve been accepted to. It’s also never too late to visit!

Picture yourself at each of the schools. Do you see yourself grabbing coffee with friends at the little cafe on campus before you walk to your morning classes? Do you see yourself conducting research in the labs or studying in the library? Do you see yourself taking part in big homecoming festivities or finding a museum in the neighborhood to explore?

## Pick a College That Will Prepare You

Ultimately, college is about preparing for a career. When you’re thinking about which school you want to choose, keep academic programs at the top of your mind. Even if you haven’t decided exactly what you want to study, think about your interests and make sure they’re available to you.

## Pick a College You Can Pay For

**Your education is an investment in your future. There are many ways to help you finance it. Use this time to think about how you will take advantage of the opportunities available—through financial aid at the college and through other sources—to create a plan to keep you on track to graduation. **
