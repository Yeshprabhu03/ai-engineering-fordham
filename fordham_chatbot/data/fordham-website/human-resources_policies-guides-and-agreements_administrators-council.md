# Administrators' Council

The Administrators’ Council (AC) makes recommendations to [senior leadership](/about/leadership-and-administration/) on matters that have a significant bearing on the University as a whole, and administrators in particular. Council members are elected from across the University in proportion to the number of employees in a division. The AC consists of a minimum of 11—and up to 25—members.

The job of the AC is to help promote the growth and welfare of its fellow administrators, creating an atmosphere in which employees are willing and able to share ideas and questions to improve the workplace environment. This forum will provide a venue for open communication and ongoing dialogue among and between administrators, as well as the University community.

The AC regularly solicits feedback from the University's administrators using an anonymous form. Administrators may submit concerns or ideas using the form, or [reach out to their representative(s) personally](/human-resources/policies-guides-and-agreements/administrators-council/administrators-council-members/#d.en.140326).

Read the [charter and bylaws](/human-resources/policies-guides-and-agreements/administrators-council/charter-and-bylaws/).
