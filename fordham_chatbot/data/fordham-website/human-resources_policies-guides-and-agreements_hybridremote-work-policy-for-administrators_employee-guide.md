## Policy Overview

[The University developed its Hybrid/Remote Work Policy (“Policy”) recognizing the changes in the work environment. Hybrid/remote work arrangements are necessary to stay market competitive, to enhance employee recruitment and retention, as well as to increase environmental sustainability. However, this flexibility to work hybrid or, in very rare cases, remotely, is offered ]** only to eligible employees** when work performance, productivity or the collaborative nature of our Jesuit mission is not compromised.

The Policy provides a framework for which positions and employees may be eligible for a hybrid/remote work arrangement. In turn, it is essential that you understand the Policy before submitting any requests for hybrid/remote work. This will allow you to have an informed and constructive discussion with your supervisor for a hybrid/remote arrangement.

## Frequently Asked Questions

1.

**What is the Difference between Hybrid and Remote Work?**

** Hybrid Work** means working from an assigned campus location for a minimum number of days during the work week and from an off-site location for the remaining workdays on a regular basis. Whether working on campus or off-site, employees are expected to perform their responsibilities and work the same general hours they were originally hired to work. Employees must reside in NY, NJ, CT or PA within a commutable distance from campus.

** Remote Work** means working from an off-site location all workdays on a regular basis. Covered employees are expected to work the same general hours that they were originally hired to work, and to perform their responsibilities as they otherwise would at an on-campus work location. An employee approved for remote work may also be required, at times, to attend meetings or work at a campus location as directed by a supervisor or as operationally necessary.

**are the exception and**

*Remote work arrangements***.**

*will be granted only under extraordinary circumstances*2. **Who is Eligible for Hybrid/Remote Work Arrangements?**

This Hybrid/Remote Work Policy applies to benefit eligible Administrators employed in the United States. Employees who wish to participate in a hybrid/remote work arrangement must be: (i) in good standing; and (ii) in a job whose duties and responsibilities are suitable for a hybrid or remote work arrangement. Eligibility for a hybrid/remote work is subject to the provisions of section 6 (Eligibility) of the Policy.

3. **Can Employees Work Remotely from Outside of the United States?**

No, employees are not permitted to work remotely from other countries due to tax and labor law implications.

4. **Who has the Authority to Approve Hybrid/Remote Work Arrangements?**

The supervisor is responsible for determining if a position or a class of positions, and the employees in those positions are eligible for a hybrid or remote work arrangement. As described in section 7.b (Approval of Hybrid/Remote Work Arrangement) of the Policy, the specific terms of the arrangement must be approved by the relevant Academic Dean (if applicable) and the Area Vice President or designee. Remote work arrangements must also be approved by the CFO and General Counsel.

5. **For How Long is the Approval of a Hybrid/Remote Work Arrangement Valid?**

Approval of a hybrid or remote arrangement ** is valid for one year** unless it is revoked sooner by the University or ended by the employee.

6. **Is There a List of Positions That Are Eligible for a Hybrid/Remote Work Arrangement?**

No, there is no University listing of eligible positions. Not all positions and employees may be suitable for hybrid/remote work. It is the responsibility of the supervisors to determine if a position or a class of positions is eligible for a hybrid or remote work arrangement based on the department’s operational and business needs. Typically, if all the duties of the position can be accomplished at an equal or higher level of performance from an off-site location, the position *may *be eligible for hybrid/remote work. Some positions may be eligible only for “seasonal” hybrid work depending upon the fluctuating nature of the work schedule and the operational needs during a particular time of year.

7. **Can a Hybrid/Remote Work Arrangement for Two (2) Similar Positions be Handled Differently? Can One be Approved and the Other Denied?**

Yes. It cannot be assumed that the same decision is appropriate for similar positions and employees of those positions, as these decisions must be guided by the business needs of the department. Section 6 (Eligibility) of the Policy provides supervisors the guidelines for evaluating eligibility. Supervisors should document the rationale of their decision when denying a request.

8. **What if an Employee Disagrees About Their Position’s Eligibility or Denial of Hybrid/Remote Work?**

If a request is denied, or an employee does not agree with the terms of their hybrid/remote work arrangement, the supervisor should attempt to resolve the matter informally with the employee. If needed, supervisors should consult with their Academic Dean (if applicable), Area Vice President or the Office of Human Resources Management.

9. **What Happens if an Employee with a Hybrid/Remote Work Arrangement Transfers to Another Department?**

The employee will have to apply for approval of a hybrid/remote work arrangement at the new department and may be granted approval at the discretion of the new supervisor, Academic Dean (if applicable) and Area Vice President.

10. **Are Employees Reimbursed for Expenses on Printing, Phone, Internet, Furniture, etc. Incurred at the Off-site Work Location?**

There will be no reimbursement for printing, phone, internet or furniture for off-site work location and all costs, whether relating to the initial set-up or the maintenance of an off-site work location, will be borne by the employee.

11. **Are Employees Covered Under Workers’ Compensation Insurance for Injuries Which Occur While Working from an Off-site Location?**

Yes. Such incidents of injury should be reported and handled in the same manner as if the injury occurred on campus.

12. **What Should an Employee Do if They Have Connectivity Issues While Working from an Off-site Location?**

If employees experience internet, phone, or power outages, they should get in touch with their supervisor as soon as possible. The supervisor will determine what work can still be performed during the outage or if the employee may have to come to campus. If problems persist, the supervisor will revisit the hybrid/remote work arrangement to determine if employee’s off-site location is suitable for continued hybrid/remote work.

13. **What Should an Employee Do if They Are Ill on the Day When They Are Working from Off-site Location?**

If illness or other issues prevent an employee from working on off-site workdays, the employee should follow the department’s normal process for reporting absence and seek supervisor’s approval for appropriate leave, as they would for on-campus workdays.

14. **Who Should I Contact If I Have Questions About the Hybrid/Remote Work Arrangements?**

Employees should contact their supervisors for specific questions about their eligibility and scheduling.
