# Hybrid/Remote Work Policy Supervisor Guide

Supervisors play a vital role in implementing a Hybrid/Remote Work Program. This guide is intended to familiarize supervisors with the responsibilities, processes and resources that will help in managing an effective and productive hybrid/remote work environment.

The University developed its Hybrid/Remote Work Policy (“Policy”) recognizing the changes in the work environment. Hybrid/remote work arrangements are necessary to stay market competitive, to enhance employee recruitment and retention, as well as to increase environmental sustainability. However, this flexibility to work hybrid or, in very rare cases, remotely, is offered * only to eligible employees* when work performance, productivity or the collaborative nature of our Jesuit mission is not compromised.

Policy Overview

The Policy provides a framework for assessing which positions and employees may be eligible for a hybrid/remote work arrangement. In turn, it is essential that supervisors understand the Policy before processing any requests for hybrid/remote work. This will allow the supervisors to have an informed and constructive discussion with employees who wish to apply for a hybrid/remote arrangement.

Supervisor Responsibilities

It is your responsibility to ensure that the hybrid/remote work arrangements for your team:

- Support the University’s mission and vision, as well as align with the operational and business needs;
- Sustain service levels, quality of work, and productivity; and
- Approvals are made without favoritism or bias.

### Determine Position Eligibility for Hybrid/Remote Work Arrangement

Determine suitability for hybrid/remote work arrangements for your team. Consider:

- Nature of the work and responsibilities to be performed are conducive to a hybrid/remote work location without causing disruption to performance or service.
- The needs of the department to advance its core mission and fulfill its role in that mission, including frequency of meetings, department goals and projects, and space constraints.
- Other collaborating departments’ needs and schedules.
- Whether or not daily face-to-face, in-person interaction is required, including on-campus appointments or meetings with students, constituents, or colleagues. Generally, positions with significant face-to-face, in-person interactions or require regular access to onsite confidential documents may not be suitable for hybrid/remote work.
- The position does not require onsite employee supervision.
- An excellent level of service can be maintained without hardship on collaborating departments, students, internal constituents and co-workers.
- Identification of a backup to monitor the hybrid/remote employee in the supervisor’s absence.

### Determine Employee Eligibility for Hybrid/Remote Work Arrangement

After you have determined which positions are eligible for a hybrid or, in rare cases, remote work arrangement, you should evaluate if the employee(s) in the position is in good standing and can satisfactorily complete the job functions from an off-site work location. You should assess employee’s work habits, attitude, and overall performance based on the following:

- A clear understanding of the position and expectations;
- The ability to work independently, not requiring close supervision;
- The ability to work collaboratively with University stakeholders;
- Met or exceeded performance expectations in the last performance evaluation;
- Consistent ability to complete tasks and assignments timely and accurately;
- A high degree of workplace responsiveness to all constituents; and
- Communication skills.

### Determine Schedules for Eligible Employees

A hybrid work arrangement will generally require at least three (3) days of on-campus presence pursuant to the Policy. It is recommended that you plan your team’s schedules (days in the office and days at an off-site location) so there is adequate on-campus presence throughout the work week, keeping in mind the business needs of your department. Schedules should be based on business needs; not on personal preferences.

Hybrid/Remote Work Best Practices

**SETTING EXPECTATIONS**

**Clarify Expectations: **Communicate clear expectations regarding job performance and responsiveness.

**Be Specific: **Communicate specific, measurable, attainable, and time bound outcomes that you expect the employee to produce.

**Agree on Expectations: **Ensure the employee understands and is aligned with work expectations.

**COMMUNICATION**

**Establish Guidelines: **Set guidelines around communications and responsiveness. For example, you may establish the expectation that emails be responded to before the end of the workday, and any missed calls should be returned within two hours. Guidelines should be clearly communicated and compatible with the operational needs of your department and deliverables.

**Communicate Regularly:** Communication is critical for successful hybrid/remote work arrangements. Set guidelines regarding response times, shared calendars and documents, as well as preferred communication methods for various situations.

**Be Available and Engage Daily: **Be available and supportive, track progress, and keep your team in the loop. Make sure employees working on-campus are available to collaborate and communicate with employees working off-site.

**RELIABLE TECHNOLOGY TOOLS**

Employees working at an off-site location should have access to reliable tools and technology to work collaboratively with the team. Reliable access to electronic files, resources, and smooth functioning of telephone/video conference calls will enhance their productivity.

Application and Approval Process

**Application**

Eligible employees who wish to apply for a hybrid/remote work arrangement are * required to formally apply* through the online electronic Hybrid/Remote Work Arrangement Form (“Form”). No informal hybrid/remote work arrangements should be made outside of this application and approval process.

**Approval Process**

Employees Submits Application:

- After the employee submits the Hybrid/Remote Work Arrangement Form, their supervisor will be notified via an email containing the link to the employee's application for supervisor’s review and approval.

Supervisor Review/Approval:

- If the supervisor determines the position and the employee are eligible for a hybrid/remote work arrangement, the supervisor grants their approval.
- The Form is electronically routed to the relevant Academic Dean (if applicable) and then to the Area Vice President for final approval of the specific terms of the work arrangement.

Academic Dean (if applicable) Area VP Approval:

- Once the Academic Dean (if applicable) and the Area Vice President approve or deny the request, both the supervisor and employee will be notified via an email regarding the final decision.
- Applications for remote work will need the approval of the CFO and the General Counsel.

For a step-by-step guide for accessing and processing the Form, please see [Appendix A](#appendix).

No, there is no University listing of eligible positions. Not all positions and employees may be suitable for hybrid/remote work. It is the responsibility of the supervisors to determine if a position or a class of positions is eligible for a hybrid or remote work arrangement based on the department’s operational and business needs. Typically, if all the duties of the position can be accomplished at an equal or higher level of performance from an off-site location, the position may be eligible for hybrid/remote work.

Some positions may be eligible only for “seasonal” hybrid work depending upon the fluctuating nature of the work schedule and the operational needs during a particular time of the year.

**What Should an Employee Do if They Have Connectivity Issues While Working from an Off-site Location?**

If employees experience internet, phone, or power outages, they should get in touch with their supervisor as soon as possible. The supervisor will determine what work can still be performed during the outage or if the employee may have to come to campus and if any makeup time will be required. If problems persist, the supervisor will revisit the hybrid/remote work arrangement to determine if employee’s off-site location is suitable for continued hybrid/remote work.

**What Should an Employee Do if They Are Ill on the Day When They Are Working from an Off-site Location?**

If illness or other issues prevent an employee from working on off-site workdays, the employee should follow the department’s normal process for reporting absence and seek supervisor’s approval for appropriate leave, as they would for on-campus workdays.
