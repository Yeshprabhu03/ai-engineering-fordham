### About the Programs

Ailey/Fordham B.F.A. in Dance

*Co-Directors: Melanie Person, The Ailey School; Andrew Clark, Fordham University*

*Program Manager: Emily Riehle*

The Ailey/Fordham program offers students the best of both worlds: professional dance training at the official school of the world-renowned Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and an exceptional liberal arts education rooted in the Jesuit tradition of intellectual development and personal attention at Fordham College at Lincoln Center.

The Fordham Jazz Ensemble is open to all students interested in learning about and performing music by great jazz composers and arrangers, including Duke Ellington, Benny Carter, Thad Jones, Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie, Mary Lou Williams, and Charles Mingus. Students learn about melody, harmony, arranging, song form, and improvising in various group formats. And they perform several times throughout the year.
