## Serving the Fordham Community Since 1977

We have been proudly serving the Fordham community as an emergency response agency for over 35 years. Please take full advantage of the information and resources we have made available.

If you are experiencing a medical emergency on or off campus (within the greater Belmont community), please contact Public Safety at 718-817-2222 and request FUEMS so that they may be dispatched and will be at your aid.
