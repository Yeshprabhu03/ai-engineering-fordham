Daniel Soyer’s research has focused mainly on Eastern European Jewish immigrants to the United States during the mass migration of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, on transnational Jewish politics, and on New York politics in the mid to late 20th century.

His work has examined how Yiddish-speaking immigrants Americanized on their own terms in the context of fraternal and mutual aid societies made up of people from the same home towns; how New York City shaped the development of Jewish politics, culture, community and identity, as well as how Jews influenced the city; and the role of travel – especially to Poland, the Soviet Union and Palestine -- in Jewish political debates in the interwar period. His most recent book recounts the history of New York’s Liberal Party, a social democratic labor party based in the garment unions, and explores not only its influence, but also its eventual degeneration into what many considered a cynical patronage machine.

In his current project, Dr. Soyer seeks to contribute to the burgeoning genre of family histories as vehicles for exploration of larger historical issues. Through the story of one family (his own), he will explore traditional Jewish life in the Russian Empire’s Pale of Settlement, migrations to the interior of Russia and cultural Russification, immigration to the United States, and cultural and political movements, including the Haskalah (Jewish Enlightenment), the rise of modern Hebrew and Yiddish literature, Zionism, Communism, social realism in the visual arts, and acculturation into an urban, liberal, cosmopolitan American identity.


Dr. Soyer has advised or curated a variety of film and exhibition projects at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, WNET-TV, the Museum of the City of New York, the Center for Jewish History, and elsewhere, and is a member of the academic council of the American Jewish Historical Society. He has had several moments of fame, resulting from an appearance on the television series “History Detectives,” from being quoted by Malcolm Gladwell in*Outliers: The Story of Success*(2008), and from being featured in the*New York Times*article about New Yorkers with deep roots in the city.

From 2016 through 2021, Dr. Soyer was co-editor of the journal*American Jewish History*. -
