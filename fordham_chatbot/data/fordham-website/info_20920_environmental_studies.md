# Environmental Studies Program

## A Sciences and Humanities Major Program

Who speaks for Earth and addresses the world’s big environmental challenges? With a degree in environmental studies at Fordham, you can.

You’ll tackle the most pressing issues of our times: Climate change. Habitat loss. Mass species extinction. Natural capital degradation. Environmental health. Environmental justice. Building sustainable societies.

### Study Both Science and the Humanities With a Focus on Policy Solutions

You’ll do interdisciplinary [course work](/academics/departments/environmental-studies/major-and-minor/) in the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities to gain insight into the physical and societal causes and effects of environmental problems, integrating these disciplines in economic, political, and societal policy solutions.

### Choose Your Major Concentration and Career Track

[Career tracks](/academics/departments/environmental-studies/major-and-minor/career-tracks/) such as conservation biology, pre-health program, environmental law, sustainable business, sustainable architecture and urban planning, environmental journalism, or sustainable agriculture, are developed through course electives, internships, study abroad, senior thesis research, and our Alumni Career Advisory Board, allowing you to graduate with a clear academic profile and strong professional resume.

### Access to World-class Fordham and NYC Facilities

- Louis Calder Center Biological Field Station
- St. Rose’s campus urban agriculture garden
- Facilities campus sustainability program
- University partnerships with New York Botanical Garden, Wildlife Conservation Society (Bronx Zoo), and Bronx River Alliance (Department of Parks)

### Studying Abroad Takes You Around The Globe

[Study abroad](/academics/departments/environmental-studies/major-and-minor/study-abroad/) courses and fieldwork from Denmark to South Vietnam, Africa, and Australia give you invaluable international experience and can be counted toward the environmental studies major or minor (up to four courses).

### Practice in Professional Internships What You're Studying in Courses

You’ll start practicing what you’re studying now by taking advantage of [internship opportunities](/academics/departments/environmental-studies/internships/) in New York City, abroad, and in our special Bronx River Stewardship and Internship Program, incorporating professional experience into your course work, and your employment resume and graduate-school application.

### Pursue Your Own Original Research

Your [research](/academics/departments/environmental-studies/research/) in courses, study abroad, and internships culminates in the senior research thesis. You’ll spend a semester or entire year on an original research project under the guidance of faculty members and publish your research in an online journal format.

### Participate in a Close-knit Community of Learners

[Environmental clubs](/academics/departments/environmental-studies/about-us/environmental-clubs/) at Rose Hill and Lincoln Center sponsored by our program allow you to participate in a close-knit community of learners also beyond the classroom and pursue activities such as campus ecology projects, invited speakers, career fairs, and field trips.

### Environmental Citizenship and Mission

You’ll serve the [mission of Fordham](/about/mission-statement/) and our program: to respect the environment, serve the greater good, and be an exemplary environmental citizen and leader.
