# Merchant Credit Card Acceptance Policy

## Policy Statement

The University’s credit card program is managed by the Office of Treasury Operations pursuant to applicable state and federal laws and regulations, and the regulations of the payment card industry (PCI). All credit card collection programs must be registered with the Treasury Office. For purposes of this policy, the term credit card includes branded debit cards (having credit card logo and not requiring pin input) unless otherwise indicated.

University departments may accept credit cards for the payment of transcripts, application fees, housing deposits, miscellaneous charges, conference fees, event tickets, payments in collection and donations. Credit cards may be accepted for programs administered by Professional and Continuing studies; Gabelli School of Business Evening program; all summer charges for undergraduate, Graduate Arts and Sciences and Graduate Religion programs.

The University also accepts payment by credit card with a convenience fee for tuition, room and board, and technology and general fees.

**All fees and charges associated with credit card payments are the responsibility of the department collecting the receipts.**

Fordham accepts Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express cards.

## Reason for Policy

Credit card data is high risk confidential information that is protected by state and federal law and Fordham University has a legal obligation to protect it. Credit card associations require all merchants to follow protocols entitled Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (“PCI DSS”), which are designed to prevent cardholder fraud and identity theft. PCI DSS is a set of association mandated requirements for the handling of credit card information, classification of merchants and validation of merchant compliance. All merchants must comply with PCI DSS before accepting credit cards and must also certify their compliance annually. The risks of noncompliance include substantial fines and penalties imposed on the University by the card associations, liability for all financial losses incurred as a result of a security failure, and damage to the University’s reputation.

## Who Must Comply

All individuals and departments that collect credit card payments or process, store or transmit cardholder data or plan to outsource the process.

## Procedures

Credit card acceptance is a convenience but it also entails legal/financial risk for the University and requires substantial compliance activities. Before requesting a merchant account, departments should consider the risks and responsibilities associated with accepting credit cards, as well as payment alternatives.

A Merchant Identification Number (MID) is an account established with the University’s credit card processor and bank to uniquely identify and track credit/debit card sales and processing fees. MID’s are approved and assigned by the Office of Treasury Operations.

The department requesting the Merchant ID must identify an individual who shall be responsible for reporting and for compliance with this policy. Changes to responsible parties must be reported to the Treasury Office.
