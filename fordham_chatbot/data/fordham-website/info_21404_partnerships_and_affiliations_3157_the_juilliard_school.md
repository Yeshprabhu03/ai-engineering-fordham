Bill Baker teaches a course on the business of the performing arts that attracts students from Fordham and the Juilliard School.

A big reason to study music at Fordham College at Lincoln Center is in our very name. Music is all around us. Among our neighbors like Jazz at Lincoln Center, the Metropolitan Opera, New York Philharmonic, and the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, is the Juilliard School which has been training and educating exceptionally talented young performing artists from around the world since 1905.

Through Fordham’s arrangement with Juilliard, advanced music majors may take courses for academic credit at The Juilliard School Evening Division.
