# Title IX Office

Fordham University is committed to a living, learning, and work environment free of any kind of sexual violence or misconduct. The University will take prompt steps reasonably calculated to end the sexual violence, eliminate any hostile environment, prevent recurrences, and, as appropriate, remedy any effects.

The Title IX Office is responsible for the University’s Title IX compliance efforts and violations of University policies, including gender equity in athletics, limitations on consensual relationships, sex and gender discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, other sexual misconduct, stalking, forcible touching, dating and domestic violence, intimidation and retaliation for filing such complaints. For more information and full descriptions of prohibited conduct, please read the Sexual and Related Misconduct Policies and Procedures for the Fordham University Community.

Inquiries concerning the application of Title IX and its implementing regulation may be referred to the designated Title IX Coordinator or to the [Office for Civil Rights](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/howto.html) of the U.S. Department of Education.

**Update:** University policies on sexual and related misconduct apply to in-person interactions as well as online interactions. Members of the community are expected to maintain a tone of civility and respect during online classes and in online communications just as they would if they were physically on campus.
