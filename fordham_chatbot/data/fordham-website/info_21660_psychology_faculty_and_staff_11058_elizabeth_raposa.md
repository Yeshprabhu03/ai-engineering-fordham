My research focuses on the negative impact of early life stress on youth socio-emotional development, as well as protective factors that can mitigate the risk associated with early stress.

In one line of work, I examine the biological and interpersonal mechanisms that explain the mental health consequences of early stress exposure in marginalized communities of youth. Although some of this research examines the impact of a particular stressor, like maternal depression or poverty, most of my projects examine cumulative early life stress, given the frequent co-occurrence of stressors for at-risk youth.

In another line of work, I explore the ways in which supportive relationships can offset the risk associated with early adversities. I explore how close relationships with parents, mentors, and peers, or even fleeting positive interactions with strangers, can mitigate the negative effects of stress on youth. These projects are designed to illuminate the ways that prevention and intervention efforts can harness social behavior and close relationships in order to promote positive psychosocial development. Much of my recent work in this area has explored whether and how youth mentoring programs improve psychosocial and academic outcomes for youth growing up in risky environments, and how adjustments to mentoring programs could help to serve these youth more effectively. My ultimate goal is to leverage this body of research to reduce health disparities in traditionally underserved populations of youth.
