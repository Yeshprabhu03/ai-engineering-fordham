[Celia B. Fisher](https://www.fordham.edu/info/21660/faculty_and_staff/5337/celia_fisher)(Fordham University). Supported by NIDA Grant# 1R25DA031608-01.Now in its eighth year, the Fordham HIV and Drug Abuse Prevention Research Ethics Training Institute (RETI) is a training grant sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (#1R25DA031608-01, Principal Investigator,

[Celia B. Fisher](https://www.fordham.edu/info/21660/faculty_and_staff/5337/celia_fisher), Director[Center for Ethics Education](https://www.fordham.edu/info/24014/center_for_ethics_education)). The RETI provides early career investigators in the social, behavioral, medical and public health fields with an opportunity to gain research ethics training. A major function of the RETI is also to conduct institute-funded research on ethical issues in HIV and drug use research. In doing so, RETI addresses the urgent need for HIV investigators who can identify and address ethical issues, engage drug-using and other at-risk communities in the construction and evaluation of population-sensitive research protections, and generate empirical data to inform ethical practice and policies for HIV prevention science. Through their funded Mentored Research Project (MRP), RETI fellows generate empirical data, publish their findings in a variety of high-impact academic journals, and are trained to apply for increasing grant opportunities. -

[Dr. Celia B. Fisher](https://www.fordham.edu/info/21660/faculty_and_staff/5337/celia_fisher), Professor in the Fordham University Applied Developmental Psychology program and Director of both the Center for Ethics Education and the NIDA funded HIV/Drug Abuse Prevention Research Ethics Institute.In the HD&SJ lab, our research is at the intersection of developmental science and social justice. We apply developmental theory and research methods, as well as contemporary research ethics frameworks, to examine the experiences that promote equity and wellbeing among under-researched populations. Our current projects focus on issues of stigma, identity, health disparities and the role of personal and systemic experiences in daily life. We explore these experiences within underserved adolescent groups: ethnic minorities, LGBT and individuals with a history of mental health and substance-use conditions. We are committed to conducting and promoting research that enhances the responsible conduct of research by looking at issues such as informed consent, motivations and implications of research participation and facilitators and barriers to health care services
