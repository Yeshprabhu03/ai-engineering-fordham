Fordham’s doctoral program in psychometrics and quantitative psychology (PQP) offers a broad education in various sophisticated measurement, evaluation, and statistical skills. Students in our program not only learn how to develop and apply advanced data analytic methods but are also trained to understand data in context and evaluate methods critically. Our graduates are prepared for careers in industry, research, and teaching.

With help and guidance from faculty mentors, our doctoral students perform research in one or more of the following areas:

- Cognitive diagnostic modeling
- Bayesian statistics
- Structural equation modeling
- Item response theory
- Hierarchical linear modeling
- Longitudinal modeling
- Missing data analysis
- Categorical data analysis
- Mixture modeling
- Propensity score analysis
- Estimation theory and psychometric/statistical algorithm development
- Affective instrument design
- Latent variable modeling
- Measurement invariance/Differential item functioning

Our program also provides a strong foundation in general psychology. Students regularly interact with faculty and students in other psychology doctoral programs. Consistent with Fordham’s commitment to the dignity and uniqueness of each person, students develop a deep understanding of the ethical principles that guide modern research.
