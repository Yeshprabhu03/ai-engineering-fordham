# Bias-Related Incidents and/or Hate Crimes

In accordance with its mission, Fordham University respects the fundamental dignity of students, faculty, and staff from all backgrounds and identities, strives to create a community that does the same and facilitates the education and development of students as men and women for and with others. Bias-related incidents and hate crimes are unacceptable and antithetical to these goals as they send a powerful message of intolerance and discrimination, disrupt the community and educational environment, and erode standards of civility.

It should be noted, however, that the University values freedom of expression and the open exchange of ideas. The expression of controversial ideas and differing views is a vital part of University discourse. Although the expression of an idea or point of view may be offensive or inflammatory to others, it may not constitute a hate crime or bias-related incident. While this value of openness protects the expression of controversial ideas, it does not protect or condone harassment or expressions of bias or hate aimed at individuals or groups that violate the University Code of Conduct.

**What is a Hate Crime?**

A hate crime is defined in Section 485.05 of the New York State Penal Law in the following manner:

Hate Crimes - A person commits a hate crime when he or she commits a specified offense *(as defined in Section 485.05[3]) *and either:

(a) Intentionally selects the person against whom the offense is committed or intended to be committed in whole or in substantial part because of a belief or perception regarding the race, color, national origin, ancestry, gender, gender identity or expression, religion, religious practice, age, disability or sexual orientation of a person, regardless of whether the belief or perception is correct, or

(b) Intentionally commits the act or acts constituting the offense in whole or in substantial part because of a belief or perception regarding the race, color, national origin, ancestry, gender, religion, religious practice, age, disability or sexual orientation of a person, regardless of whether the belief or perception is correct.

**What is a Bias-Related Incident?**

Not all hateful behavior rises to the level of a crime. Bias-Related Incidents refer to any act or behavior that is a violation of the University Code of Conduct and reasonably believed to be motivated by a consideration (real or perceived) of race, color, religion, age, sex, gender, gender identity or expression, national origin, marital or parental status, sexual orientation, citizenship status, veteran status, disability, or any other basis prohibited by law.

Individuals are encouraged to report all hate crimes and bias-related incidents immediately to the Department of Public Safety via telephone, in person or online and/or to the Dean of Students:

**What happens when a Bias-Related Incident and/or Hate Crime is Reported?**

After consultation with the alleged victim/complainant and sensitive consideration of the facts of the case, an investigation of the incident will be conducted by the Department of Public Safety and/or the Dean of Students so that appropriate student conduct action may be taken. When an incident involves a University employee as a perpetrator or a victim, the Office of Human Resources will be notified and participate in the investigation with other appropriate University officials. Internal proceedings do not supersede, and will not interfere with, an individual's right to pursue other legal remedies, including criminal prosecution. The Department of Public Safety maintains a cooperative relationship with local police precincts and will assist any victim in every possible way through the process of reporting, investigation, and resolution of any criminal proceedings.

Anyone who believes they may be a victim of bias-related incidents and/or hate crimes is also encouraged to utilize the services provided by the Office of Multicultural Affairs, Counseling and Psychological Services, and Campus Ministry, located at each campus, and the Vice President for Equity & Inclusion.

In accordance with Section 6436 of the New York State Education Law, and in order to inform the Fordham community about bias-related crime prevention and reporting procedures, the Associate Vice President for Public Safety provides a series of presentations on student safety, residence hall safety, reporting procedures, and the types, definitions, and penalties of bias-related crimes. In addition, public safety procedures and the availability of counseling and support services are discussed with incoming students and their parents at New Student Orientation and through First Year Core Programming. Students are informed about events that affect their personal safety and the safety of the Fordham community through Public Safety Alerts and in the student press. Key staff in residential life, public safety, student life and student services are trained to respond to bias-related incidents, hate crimes and other crimes reported on campus.
