It’s time to use your gifts in service of the world.

Our program is rigorous—and full of choice. You will complete a specific core of foundational international courses in politics, law, economics, history, and culture, and then choose one of three tracks of specialized study. You’ll combine classroom learning with internships and study abroad.

You will master the political, economic, environmental, historic, cultural, and sociological dynamics that drive modern life. And then what? Will you work to alleviate poverty? Promote justice? Protect human rights? Respect the environment?

It’s time to get started.

Our program reflects Fordham’s Jesuit tradition of respect for other cultures, the dignity of each unique person, and the development of the student as a whole person.

That’s why you’ll learn more than international studies here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, history, literature, mathematics, languages, science, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.

There are three concentrations:

- International Expertise: analyze international affairs from a global perspective
