Eunice Hunton Carter Distinguished Research Scholar, Professor of Law


**Areas of Expertise:** Equality, Constitutional Law, Human Rights, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in a Digital Age

-
Professor Catherine Powell is a leading expert on questions of human rights and equality theory. She has worked on these matters in the White House under both Presidents Obama and Biden as well as on Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s State Department Policy Planning Staff. Her current work focuses on how the digital economy is restructuring our relationships with each other, with the state, and even with ourselves (in how we perform and express ourselves online) and the implications of this for law. More broadly, her work explores matters concerning equality law, belonging, and inclusion.

She coined the term "Color of Covid" through a series of CNN op-eds and a Yale Journal of Law and Feminism law review article. Previously, Professor Powell was on the Columbia Law School faculty, where she was a clinical professor as founding director of the Human Rights Clinic and the Human Rights Institute. At Fordham Law, she teaches constitutional law, human rights, feminist theory, and civil rights in a digital age. She has also served on various boards, including the Human Rights Watch board of directors and the American Journal of International Law board of editors. Other previous leadership positions include her roles as Vice President of the American Society of International Law (ASIL) and co-chair of Blacks in ASIL (BASIL). She is the Eunice Hunton Carter Distinguished Research Scholar and moderator of a lecture series named after Eunice Carter.
