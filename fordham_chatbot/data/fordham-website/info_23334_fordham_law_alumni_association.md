# Fordham Law Alumni Association

The Association helps Fordham Law achieve this goal by deepening the already strong bond between the School and its alumni. Alumni involvement and a commitment to one another have always been and will continue to be hallmarks of the Association’s work. Whether it be the 800-person Annual Luncheon or an affinity group meeting of 25, FLAA dues subsidize the ticket price of every alumni event.

The FLAA is one of the largest law school alumni associations in the country, thanks to Fordham Law’s outstanding alumni.
