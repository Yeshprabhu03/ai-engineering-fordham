# Curran Center for American Catholic Studies

**Our mission is to:**

- Educate rising generations of religiously-informed citizens
- Foster ecumenical, inter-religious, and interdisciplinary engagement with Catholic thought and practice
- Promote informed and compassionate analysis of the critical religious and social issues of our time.

## A Center for American Catholic Studies

-
- The Center focuses on the rich and complex story of Catholicism in the Americas.
- We take a ‘hemispheric’ approach to Catholicism that recognizes the interwoven tapestry of Catholicism in North, Central, South America, and the Caribbean—the entire “ecclesia in America.”

-
- The Curran Center is rooted in Fordham’s Roman Catholic Jesuit identity, an identity that inspires a critical-faithful approach to the tradition and a creative search to imagine its place in the world.
- Catholic means universal, and the Center’s vision of Catholicism is global and inclusive.
- Our conversations are ecumenical, interreligious, and with those not having religious identities.
- Inspired by the example of Pope Francis, we recognize that thinking about faith demands thinking about justice issues such as poverty, peace, and the earth as well.

-
- As a university-based center, we emphasize an approach to Catholicism that is intellectual and engaged.
- Our American Catholic Studies concentration provides Fordham undergraduates with an opportunity for intensive study of the Catholic tradition enhanced by events, outings, mentorship, service, and an experience of the community.
- Our programming includes lectures by distinguished scholars, conferences on timely issues, and faculty reading groups that explore topics of faith, justice, aesthetics, and human meaning.
- Our awards and book series seek to support scholarship on Catholicism that is creative, critical, and explores new horizons.
