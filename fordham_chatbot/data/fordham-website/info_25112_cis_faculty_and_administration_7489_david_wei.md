Professor David S.L. Wei received his PhD degree in Computer and Information Science from the University of Pennsylvania in 1991. He has authored and co-authored more than 60 technical papers in the areas of distributed and parallel processing, wireless networks and mobile computing, and optical networks in various archival journals and conference proceedings. His contributions have helped advance the frontier of knowledge in those areas. Dr. Wei served on the program committee and was a session chair for several reputed international conferences. He also served as a co-chair of Power Aware Communication and Software, Minitrack in the Software Track at the 34th Hawaii International Conference on Systems Sciences (HICSS-34). He is a lead guest editor of IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications for the special issue on Mobile Computing and Networking. Currently, Dr. Wei focuses his research effort on mobile computing and wireless networks.

I have worked on some fundamental problems in the areas of parallel and distributed processing, mobile computing, and optical networks. In particular, I have worked in the areas of routing and sorting, parallel parsing, task scheduling, distributed systems, mobile computing , and WDM. My current research interests are in the areas of wireless networks and mobile computing. Wireless communication has added a new dimension to the way people have started communicating, be it for personal, business, or entertainment purpose. The new challenges in designing software systems for wireless networks include mobility and resource management, power conservation, middleware design for peer-to-peer communications, among others. Therefore, my current research mainly focuses on channel assignment, power-efficient 802.11 MAC protocol design, co-existence of 802.11 and Bluetooth technologies, and power-aware topology control in wireless ad-hoc networks.
