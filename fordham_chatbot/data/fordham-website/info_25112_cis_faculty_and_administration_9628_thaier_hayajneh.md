Thaier Hayajneh, Ph.D. is the founder and director of Fordham Center for Cybersecurity, University Professor, and director of the cybersecurity programs at Fordham University, New York. Prior to joining Fordham, he was a full-time faculty of computer science at New York Institute of Technology and founding director of NYIT Center of Excellence in Cyber Security (2014-2016). He also worked as Chair and Associate Professor at the Computer Engineering Department at the Hashemite University in Jordan (2009-2014). He received his Ph.D. and M.S. degrees in Information Sciences with specialization in cybersecurity and Networking from the University of Pittsburgh, PA. He also received his MS and BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan, in 1999 and 1997, respectively.

He served on several NSF Cybersecurity review panels and serves as a CAE reviewer and mentor for NSA. His research focuses on cybersecurity and networking, including wireless security, applied cryptography, blockchain and cryptocurrency, and IoT security, privacy, and forensics. His research was funded by NSA, DoD, NSF and he published over 80 papers in reputable journals and conferences.

Dr. Hayajneh is currently serving/served as Editor in Chief, editor, and guest editor for a number of prestigious Journals. He also served as Program Chair and on the technical program committee of several leading conferences including IEEE NSS, GLOBECOM, and ICC. He reviewed for numerus number of prestigious journals (over 100 reviews) and received several peer-review awards from Publons.

My current research area is in

**cybersecurity**and**networking**, including wireless networking security, system’s security, information assurance and privacy, crypto-resilient attacks, applied cryptography, blockchain and cryptocurrency, IoT security and privacy, cyber-physical systems and WBAN security, steganography, lightweight cryptographic algorithms and protocols, cloud-computing security, ad hoc and WSNs, secure remote patient monitoring systems, computer networks protocols and QoS, and wireless networks coexistence.More specifically, my research focusses on applying and designing security protocols and techniques to secure systems including: medical systems, wireless systems, Internet-of-Things, Sensors, and electronics systems, computer systems, networking systems, etc. Hence, I publish in journals and conferences that are related to these fields and indexed in Scopus (Elsevier) and/or Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics).
