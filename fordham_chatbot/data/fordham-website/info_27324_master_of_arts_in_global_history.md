History has only recently come to be understood from a global perspective. At Fordham, our goal is not just to include more regions and peoples in the human story, but to identify new questions about the many worlds we study—whether they are local communities or planet-spanning systems. These new insights lead us across spatial scales to examine migration and exchange, global empires, cultural transfers, and more.
