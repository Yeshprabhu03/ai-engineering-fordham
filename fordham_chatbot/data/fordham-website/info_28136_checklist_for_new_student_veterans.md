# Checklist for New Student Veterans

**CERTIFICATION OF BENEFITS**

Each student must request benefits certification at the beginning of each term. Failure to do some will result in delayed tuition and BAH payments. The video below will walk you through the process.

[National Archive](https://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records)) - DD-214, (can be requested through the

- When you receive your COE, make sure to e-mail a copy of your COE and your DD-214 (member copy 4) to your corresponding Fordham certifying official so they can create your student/VA profile and get your credits certified. (
- Once you pass your end of active service (EAS), immediately call the VA Education, Benefits, and Training Department at (1-888-442-4551) and ask the following questions to prepare accordingly:
- Are you registered as a veteran in their system? (You need to be registered as a veteran in their system to receive BAH). Do not assume this happens automatically. You may need to send the VA a copy of your DD-214 to confirm your eligibility.
- Make sure your mailing address and pertinent information are updated with the VA as they periodically send important mail.
- Arrange to set up your direct deposit information in their system. You will need to provide the VA your personal bank routing number and account number. Otherwise, expect to receive a check by mail which could further delay receipt of your benefits.


* Note A:* If your semester starts before your end of active service, (i.e. going to college during your terminal leave), there may be some financial planning issues to work out. Reach out to your certifying officials (Ms. Heslin-Scott/ Ms. Saumell).

* Note B:* Do note, there's a delay in receiving your BAH and it usually takes about a month – i.e. receiving your housing allowance for September/January on October/February 1st.

*Plan your financials accordingly.*
