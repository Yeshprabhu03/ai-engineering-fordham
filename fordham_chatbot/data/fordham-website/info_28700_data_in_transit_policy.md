## Definitions

**Authorization **is a process by which a server determines if the individual has permission to use a resource or access a file. Authorization is usually coupled with authentication so the server can identify the individual requesting access.

**Encryption** involves the process of transforming data so that it is unreadable by anyone who does not have a decryption key. Encryption in transit means ensuring that all data sent over a network is encrypted.

**IT Resources** include computing, networking, communications, application, and telecommunications systems, infrastructure, hardware, software, data, databases, personnel, procedures, physical facilities, cloud-based vendors, Software as a Service (SaaS) vendors, and related materials and services.
