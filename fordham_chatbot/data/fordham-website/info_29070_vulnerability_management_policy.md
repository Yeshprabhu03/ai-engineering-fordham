# Vulnerability Management Policy

## Version 1.3

**For Students, Faculty, Staff, Guests, Alumni**

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to ensure a higher level of security to the University’s IT Resources provided through vulnerability management.

## Scope

This IT security policy, and all policies referenced herein, shall apply to all members of the University community, including faculty, students, administrative officials, staff, alumni, authorized guests, delegates, and independent contractors (the “User(s)” or “you”) who use, access, or otherwise employ, locally or remotely, the University’s IT Resources, whether individually controlled, shared, stand-alone, or networked.

## Policy Statement

- All patches or configuration changes must be deployed to University-owned or managed IT Resources per the timeframe stated in the
[Vulnerability Management Procedure](/information-technology/it-security--assurance/it-policies-procedures-and-guidelines/vulnerability-management-procedure/). - Information Security and Assurance (ISA) provides approved standard tools and methodologies for vulnerability assessments.
- All IT Resources must be part of a patch management cycle as defined in
[Patch Management Policy](/information-technology/it-security--assurance/it-policies-procedures-and-guidelines/patch-management-policy/). - Application and System Owners are responsible for the assessment and remediation of IT Resources under their management or supervision.
- ISA must approve any compensating or mitigating controls should a solution not be available or practical to address a vulnerability. A risk assessment will be conducted.
- Application and System Owners must have a written and auditable procedure addressing remediation steps.

## Definitions

**Compensating control** is a data security measure that is designed to satisfy the requirement or some other security measure that is deemed too difficult or impractical to implement.

**IT Resources** include computing, networking, communications, applications, and telecommunications systems, infrastructure, hardware, software, data, databases, personnel, procedures, physical facilities, cloud-based vendors, Software as a Service (SaaS) vendors, and any related materials and services.

**A patch** is a software update comprised of code inserted (i.e., patched) into the code of an executable program. Typically, a patch is installed into an existing software program. Patches are often temporary fixes between full releases of a software package. Patches include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Upgrading software
- Fixing a software bug
- Installing new drivers
- Addressing new security vulnerabilities
- Addressing software stability issues

**Patch management cycle** is a part of lifecycle management and is the process of using a strategy and plan of what patches should be applied to which systems at a specified time.

**Remediation** is an effort that resolves or mitigates a discovered vulnerability.

**System Owner** is the individual or group responsible for the procurement, development, integration, modification, operation, maintenance, and retirement of the server, operating system, or other elements that support an Application Owner providing services. The System Owner provides the technical infrastructure for system state and data retention backups. If a third party provides these services, the System Owner is responsible for maintaining the relationship with the third party providing the service.

**Vulnerability management** is the practice of identifying, classifying, remediating, and mitigating vulnerabilities.
