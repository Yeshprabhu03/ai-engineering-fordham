**J.D./M.A. Program (International Political Economy and Development)****Admissions**Students must apply to and be admitted to each school independently, although such admission need not coincide. Law students may apply to the Graduate School at any time while in residence at the Law School, and it is recommended that they complete their course of studies at the Law School before beginning study at the Graduate School.

A student in residence at the Law School may take one or more courses at the Graduate School as long as the total number of classroom hours per week does not exceed the number permitted by Law School regulations. Students should email Fordham Law,

**J.D./M.B.A. Program**The J.D./M.B.A. program enables

**full-time students to complete the J.D. and M.B.A. degree requirements in as little as four calendar years**rather than the five it might take if each degree were to be pursued separately.**Admissions**Due to the required 4-week pre-term Gabelli Launch (beginning the last week of July each year), only first-year law students can apply for the J.D./M.B.A. Students must apply and be admitted to each school separately. Students already enrolled in the Law School may be accepted into this dual-degree program by submitting their application to the Gabelli School by the required application deadlines.
