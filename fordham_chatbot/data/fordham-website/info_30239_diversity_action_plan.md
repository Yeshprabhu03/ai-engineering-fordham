As a Catholic university in the Jesuit tradition, Fordham aims to form individuals who are intellectually capable and committed to building a more just world. This mission is rooted not only in the Gospel but also in the nearly [500-year history of the Jesuits](/about/living-the-mission/jesuit-and-catholic/st-ignatius-founder-of-the-jesuits/) and in the long tradition of [Catholic social teaching](#CST) which invites us to:

- Reflect on our responsibility to uphold the dignity and worth of each person as created by God
- Promote the common good
- Work toward a more just and compassionate society

As Jesus urged his followers to welcome the stranger, Fordham welcomes students, faculty, and staff from every background and faith. We embrace diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging principles as central to our mission—and part of our commitment to promote understanding, solidarity, and a sense of duty toward others and our broader community.

Only a social and political culture that includes free welcome can have a future.

[- Pope Francis, 2023](https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2023-03/pope-inclusion-is-path-towards-better-future.html)

History of Catholic Social Teaching

The roots of Catholic social teaching can be traced back to Catholic theologians such as Thomas Aquinas, who responded to historical conditions in medieval and early modern Europe. Pope Leo XIII began the development of a modern body of social teaching in 1891 with the publication of [ Rerum Novarum](https://www.papalencyclicals.net//leo13/l13rerum.htm) (Of New Things), an encyclical, or formal letter on Catholic doctrine.

In *Rerum Novarum*, he addressed the effects of rapid industrialization on cities and people, with many living in squalor and poverty. He urged that “some opportune remedy must be found quickly for the misery and wretchedness pressing so unjustly on the majority of the working class.”

Many popes have since published their own encyclicals on a wide range of social and economic issues, stressing the importance of human rights, dignity, international solidarity, and justice.
