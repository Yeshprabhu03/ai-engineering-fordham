# Spam and Phishing

Fordham University will never ask you to provide personally identifiable information (PII), such as your Fordham ID number (FIDN), via email. As a rule, do not send any PII through email. If you receive such a request via email, contact the IT Service Desk.

**Spam** is irrelevant or inappropriate messaging sent online to a large number of recipients. It can be sent via email, over text, in messaging apps, and other types of electronic media.

**Phishing **is an attempt to obtain sensitive information by disguising it as a trustworthy website, person, or company. Requests for personal information such as phone number, account ID, PIN, Social Security number, passwords, etc., are examples of information attackers in a phishing campaign might seek. Always think twice before providing sensitive information online.

If something feels fishy, it's probably a phish.

Attackers may compromise legitimate email accounts belonging to people you know or to @fordham.edu addresses by sending phishing email from these accounts.

Fordham Gmail is scanned for suspicious content. For more information, see our pages on [spam filters](/information-technology/it-security--assurance/information-security-and-assurance-resources/spam-and-phishing/) and [Targeted Attack Protection](/information-technology/it-security--assurance/information-security-and-assurance-resources/spam-and-phishing/tap-for-employees/) (TAP) for faculty and staff, which analyzes and blocks in real-time malicious URLs and attachments.

**Phishing Reporter Add-on for Fordham Gmail** Report potential phishing and malicious emails with one click from your Fordham Gmail safely and in real-time with the PhishAlarm.

**Identify fraudulent emails**

If you are unsure of a link in an email, mouse over--but don't click--on the link. A small pop-up window will appear that shows the *actual* URL that the link connects to. If the URL doesn't match, or the URL is not from a domain or company you are familiar with, then there is a good chance that this is a fraudulent email and the site is not legitimate.

Most URLs for organizations and companies use URLs that begin with **https://**. The "S" stands for secure; http:// is not a secure connection.

**If the email is from Fordham, it**

- Will come from a Fordham.edu email account
- Will not contain a generic greeting, for example, "EDU Webmail Users," or have no greeting at all
- Will not request that you respond to a non-Fordham email address
- Should be signed by a Fordham employee or department.

Forward any suspicious email to [IT Service Desk](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9ff7faf3eff6ebdff9f0edfbf7fef2b1fafbea).
