# Spam Management and Email Filters

Email protection services from Proofpoint provide added security to the protection built into Fordham Gmail. This email security solution filters spam, including emails that match known patterns for malware and phishing.

## Features

Proofpoint applies a score to each email; the higher the score, the more likely the email is spam. When a message is identified as potential spam, it is quarantined. Quarantine Summaries are sent daily, and ONLY if something is quarantined. Fordham faculty and staff are also provided with TAP, which analyzes and blocks in real-time malicious URLs and attachments that can be sent via email

### Quarantine Summary

Proofpoint places messages it deems as spam in a Quarantine Summary. A score is assigned to each email; the higher the score, the more likely the email is spam. The summary is sent to your email daily if there is spam to report or as requested by the user from the web console. In the Quarantine Summary email, you can view the messages and decide whether to release them to your inbox or mark them as not spam. The same actions can be performed from the Quarantine Summary that is located in the web console.
