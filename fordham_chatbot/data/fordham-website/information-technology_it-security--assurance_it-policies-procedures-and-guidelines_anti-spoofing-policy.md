## Version 1.3

## Scope

This IT security policy, and all policies referenced herein, shall apply to all members of the University community, including faculty, students, administrators, staff, alumni, authorized guests, delegates, and independent contractors (the "User(s)" or "you") who use, access, or otherwise employ, locally or remotely, the University's IT Resources, whether individually controlled, shared, stand-alone, or networked.

## Policy Statement

You must configure network devices to reject packets originating from non-University networks that claim to originate from within Fordham University's owned and managed networks.

## Definitions
