OnBase® by Hyland

Description

OnBase® by Hyland, Fordham University's enterprise content management system, stores documents and data that have been captured and indexed according to individual departments' business rules, records management guidelines, and retrieval needs. This information is accumulated and managed as a system of record in a secure central repository where the documents can be easily retrieved via line-of-business applications (e.g., Banner, PowerFAIDS®, Fordham Connect, FSA Atlas) or via the OnBase Web and Unity clients. Rules-based workflows move documents from point A to point B by placing documents in queues, thus eliminating the tedious and risky part of a process. Additionally, workflows route documents based on established process rules (rules-based routing) or based on a user decision (decision-based routing). Finally, each step in every process is tracked and scribed to the audit trail for each transaction to ensure compliance requirements and accountability.


OnBase provides the ability to:

-
Capture documents, including paper, electronic documents, email, system reports, e-forms

-
Manage content according to business rules

-
Store, organize, and track content

-
Create workflows to deliver documents to processes as soon as they are needed

-
Preserve and protect documents in compliance with internal and external standards



Data Retention and Recoverability

Data contained in Hyland/OnBase is manually retained. Those using Hyland/OnBase should delete documents per the

[Records Retention and Disposal Policy](https://www.fordham.edu/info/21366/policies/2785/records_retention_and_disposal_policy). We are in the process of implementing a records management module, which will manage the retention and disposition of stored documents according to predefined business rules. Data stored on Hyland/OnBase is backed up at Hyland data centers. Additionally, deleted documents are sent to a document maintenance queue and can be recovered if needed.
