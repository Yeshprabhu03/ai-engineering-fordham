## Guideline Statement

- Users may only forward messages per the
[Data Classifications Guidelines](https://www.fordham.edu/info/25534/data_classification_guidelines). - Email is typically not considered a secure data transfer method, especially when sending it externally (i.e., not the Fordham domain).
- Secure information may be emailed, provided you use a University-approved email encryption solution. Follow the instructions on the
