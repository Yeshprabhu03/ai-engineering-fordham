# Firewall/Access Control List Policy

## Version 1.6

**For Students, Faculty, Staff, Guests, Alumni**

## Purpose

This policy ensures that the University's IT Resources are properly protected behind firewalls or access control lists (ACLs).

## Scope

This IT security policy, and all policies referenced herein, shall apply to all members of the University community, including faculty, students, administrators, staff, alumni, authorized guests, delegates, and independent contractors (the “User(s)” or “you”) who use, access, or otherwise employ, locally or remotely, the University’s IT Resources, whether individually controlled, shared, stand-alone, or networked.

## Policy Statement

- System Administrators who can grant access to restricted network devices, including but not limited to routers, switches, and firewalls, must abide by the rules in this policy.
- System Administrators must verify that firewalls, switches, and router configurations, including access controls, are reviewed and examined regularly.
- All IT Resources that allow access to data, systems, and networks must contain a default "deny all" inbound access rule.
- Fordham-owned and managed IT Resources on high-risk networks, such as the PCI and DMZ (demilitarized zone) networks, must also contain a "deny all" rule on outbound traffic.
- Users must request firewall or ACL changes via the University’s ticketing system from the IT Internal Service Catalog.
- Information Security and Assurance (ISA) must approve all change requests.
- ISA must explicitly authorize outbound traffic from PCI networks.


## Definitions

**DMZ** is a physical or logical subnetwork that contains and exposes an organization's external-facing services to an untrusted network, usually a larger network such as the Internet.

**IT Resources** include computing, networking, communications, applications, telecommunications systems, infrastructure, hardware, software, data, databases, personnel, procedures, physical facilities, cloud-based vendors, Software as a Service (SaaS) vendors, and related materials and services**.**
