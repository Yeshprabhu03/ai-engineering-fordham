# Multi-Factor Authentication Policy

## Version 1.1

**For Students, Faculty, Staff, Guests, Alumni**

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to ensure identification verification by using two or more factors to access University IT Resources.

## Scope

This IT security policy, and all policies referenced herein, shall apply to all members of the University community, including faculty, students, administrators, staff, alumni, authorized guests, delegates, and independent contractors (the “User(s)” or “you”) who use, access, or otherwise employ, locally or remotely, the University’s IT Resources, whether individually controlled, shared, stand-alone, or networked.

## Policy Statement

- Users must utilize Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access all IT Resources (e.g., University portal, Blackboard
®, Google Workspace™, Zoom®). - Users must not share individual passcodes or passwords with others.
- Users may authenticate via push notifications to smartphones and tablets, mobile passcode, SMS passcode, telephone callbacks, or hardware tokens. Should these methods not be available to the User, they should contact the
[IT Service Desk](/information-technology/it-services/technology-support/)at 718-817-3999. - Information Security and Assurance must approve access to IT Resources that cannot support MFA.

## Definitions

**IT Resources** include computing, networking, communications, application, and telecommunications systems, infrastructure, hardware, software, data, databases, personnel, procedures, physical facilities, cloud-based vendors, Software as a Service (SaaS) vendors, and related materials and services.

**Multi-Factor Authentication** is an electronic authentication method in which a user is granted access to a website or application only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism: knowledge, possession, and inherence.
