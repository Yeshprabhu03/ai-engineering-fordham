# Provisioning and Deprovisioning Policy

## Version 1.6

**For Students, Faculty, Staff, Guests, Alumni**

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to define the University’s IT Resources access issuance, modification, or revocation for entities affiliated with the University.

## Scope

This IT security policy, and all policies referenced herein, shall apply to all members of the University community, including faculty, students, administrators, staff, alumni, authorized guests, delegates, and independent contractors (the “User(s)” or “you”) who use, access, or otherwise employ, locally or remotely, the University’s IT Resources, whether individually controlled, shared, stand-alone, or networked.

## Policy Statement

- Access to University IT Resources must only be granted to entities (person or non-person) following the Principle of Least Privilege.
- When an entity’s (person or non-person) role or affiliation is modified or terminated, or access is no longer required, it is the responsibility of the managing supervisor (or higher) to notify
[Human Resources](https://www.fordham.edu/info/23397/human_resources)and[IT Service](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e48c818894adb0a4828b96808c8589ca818091)Desk, as applicable, of the status change. - All provisioning and deprovisioning requests must be kept in the University’s IT ticketing system to enable an appropriate review of compliance with this policy.
- IT Resources that do not use centrally managed services (e.g., Central Authentication Service) or have an automatic provisioning/deprovisioning process in place must be manually provisioned/deprovisioned by the individual(s) responsible.
- Non-centrally managed accounts include but are not limited to:
- Service and administrative accounts,
- Educational Technologies and Research Computing accounts,
- Database accounts,
- Application-based accounts, or
- Corporate and Generic Accounts.


## Definitions

**Corporate Accounts** are departmental or group email accounts.

**Deprovisioning** is the term used when account access is suspended or disabled from use.

**Generic Accounts** are considered accounts not derived using the faculty, staff, or student naming convention. There is no corresponding ID associated with a Generic Account. These accounts do not identify the person or entity using the account. See the [Generic Account Policy](https://www.fordham.edu/information-technology/it-security--assurance/it-policies-procedures-and-guidelines/generic-accounts-policy/).

**IT Resources** include computing, networking, communications, application, telecommunications systems, infrastructure, hardware, software, data, databases, personnel, procedures, physical facilities, cloud-based vendors, Software as a Service (SaaS) vendors, and any related materials and services.

**Principle of Least Privilege **is the cybersecurity practice that individuals should have access to only IT Resources and functions required to perform their stated duties.

**Provisioning** is the term used to create or provide specific accounts and applicable access.
