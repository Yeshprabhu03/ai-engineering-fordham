# Risk Assessment Policy

## Version 1.2

**For Students, Faculty, Staff, Guests, Alumni**

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to facilitate compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations, protect the confidentiality and integrity of the University’s IT Resources, and enable informed decisions regarding Risk Management.

## Scope

This IT security policy, and all policies referenced herein, shall apply to all members of the University community, including faculty, students, administrative officials, staff, alumni, authorized guests, delegates, and independent contractors (the “User(s)” or “you”) who use, access, or otherwise employ, locally or remotely, the University’s IT Resources, whether individually controlled, shared, stand-alone, or networked.

## Policy Statement

- The Senior Director of IT Security and Assurance (or designees) is authorized to perform periodic information security Risk Assessments to determine vulnerabilities and initiate appropriate remediation.
- The University uses formal Information Security Risk Management (ISRM) programs that identify risks and implement plans to address and manage them.
- The Senior Director of IT Security and Assurance manages the ISRM program and coordinates the development and maintenance of program policies, procedures, standards, and reports.
- The ISRM program is based on risk assessment and developed in consideration of University priorities, staffing, and budget.
- Risk Assessments must identify, quantify, and prioritize risk acceptance and objectives relevant to the University. The results are to guide and determine the appropriate management action and priorities for managing information security risks and for implementing Controls to protect against these risks.
- The Risk Assessment must include the systematic approach of estimating the probability and impact of the risk and the process of analyzing the Inherent Risk score to evaluate the significance of the risk.
- Risk Assessments are performed periodically to address changes in security requirements and the risk situation (e.g., threats, vulnerabilities, impacts).
- Risk Assessments are to be undertaken systematically, capable of producing comparable and reproducible results.
