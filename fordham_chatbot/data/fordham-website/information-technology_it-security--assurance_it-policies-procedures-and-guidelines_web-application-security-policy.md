# Web Application Security Policy

## Version 2.2

**For Students, Faculty, Staff, Guests**

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to ensure that web applications maintain the security posture, compliance, risk management, and change control of University IT Resources.

## Scope

This IT security policy, and all policies referenced herein, shall apply to all members of the Fordham IT staff (the “User(s)” or “you”) who use, access, or otherwise employ, locally or remotely, the University’s IT Resources, whether individually controlled, shared, stand-alone, or networked.

## Policy Statement

- Web application security assessments must be performed to identify potential or realized weaknesses (e.g., insecure coding, inadvertent misconfiguration, weak authentication, insufficient error handling, sensitive information leakage) per the
[Vulnerability Management Policy](/information-technology/it-security--assurance/it-policies-procedures-and-guidelines/vulnerability-management-policy/). - Web applications must follow regular security or out-of-band assessments if one of the following criteria are met:
- New or significant application release.
- NB: Subject to the
[Secure Software Development Life Cycle](/information-technology/it-security--assurance/it-policies-procedures-and-guidelines/secure-software-development-life-cycle-policy/)review before approval of the change control documentation or release into the live environment. - Third-party or acquired web applications (when installed or upgraded).
- Vulnerabilities must be reported to Information Security and Assurance (ISA) and the vendor for correction.


- Shared accounts are prohibited, except where it is not technically possible to individually provision accounts.
- All Internet-facing web applications should deploy the ISA-approved technical controls (e.g., Web Application Firewall (WAF) or Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)).
- Other security controls include, but are not limited to, the following:
- Access controls,
- Configuration changes (submit non-agreed-upon configuration changes to ISA for review),
- Authentication (multi-factor authentication must be used except where it is not technically possible with ISA review and approval),
- SSO,
- Data protection (e.g., encryption, data masking),
- Error handling and logging,
- Input and output handling, and
- Session management.
