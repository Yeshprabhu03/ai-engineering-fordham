# Information Security and Assurance Service Portfolio

Fordham University is strongly committed to protecting data assets and information technology resources that support the University’s academic, administrative, and research objectives. Information Security and Assurance services and activities facilitate Fordham reaching these objectives.

-
To prepare for outages and other significant disruptions, Information Security and Assurance helps its business partners identify the technology and systems critical to their business processes, build robust technical business continuity plans and communication strategies, and test them with departmental and University-wide exercises. As part of Business Continuity Planning, Information Security and Assurance also works with business partners and other Office of Information Technology groups to compose Disaster Recovery Plans to restore critical operations in anticipation of or after an event. In addition, Information Security and Assurance actively participate in Fordham Public Safety’s University-wide emergency preparedness tabletop exercises.

The primary purpose of business continuity and disaster recovery planning is to minimize the effect of an outage or other significant disruption on critical Fordham operations.

Fordham uses

[Preparis](https://www.preparisapp.com/home)to publish and maintain departmental business continuity plans created in partnership with business process owners. -
Information Security and Assurance partners with several groups, sharing experiences and gaining insight on worldwide security threats. These groups include Higher Ed organizations, REN-ISAC, the FBI, the U.S. Secret Service, and law enforcement agencies.

As the threat landscape for information security continues to evolve and affect those around us, key partnerships are essential to staying ahead.

Information Security and Assurance provides data destruction services for various media and conditions. There are numerous data erasure and data wiping standards for the secure removal of data. In addition, the team has the technology and capability to erase or wipe data from a single low-level format to a 7-pass DoD (Department of Defense) 5220.22-M Wipe Standard.

The data must be completely erased or wiped clean when disposing of a computer, mobile device, removable media, or other storage devices. If data is improperly or not thoroughly wiped, it can be retrieved by hackers, putting Fordham assets at risk.

A request for data destruction (wiping) can be made as a service request using Tech Help on our portal or by contacting IT Service Desk at 718-817-3999 or

[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e1a9848d91a8b5a1878e938589808ccf848594). -
Information Security and Assurance guides how data should be classified and, based upon this classification, ensures that the data is stored on an appropriate platform that provides adequate data protection. This group also ensures that new solutions have appropriate data protections, either by technology, administrative controls, or contractual provisions, before they are deployed.

Identifying and classifying data and the standards and policies to properly handle each type of data help ensure proper protection, facilitate regulatory compliance, and increase awareness of who should or shouldn’t have access to it.

Fordham University’s

[Data Classification and Protection Policy](/information-technology/it-security--assurance/it-policies-procedures-and-guidelines/data-classification-and-protection-policy/)applies to all data produced, collected, stored, or used by the University, its employees, student workers, consultants, and agents during their relationship with the University. The[Data Classification Guidelines](/information-technology/it-security--assurance/it-policies-procedures-and-guidelines/data-classification-guidelines/)can help you understand the regulations and policies governing Protected and Sensitive Data and determine where to store your files. -
Information Security and Assurance employs a variety of proactive and reactive tools to protect University data in print, in use, at rest, and in transit – both on-site and on remote equipment. The tools include but are not limited to enterprise-class encryption software, personally identifiable information cataloging, shredding services, data destruction, redaction, and obfuscation tools.

Data loss/leakage prevention tools and techniques mitigate and, whenever possible, prevent the loss of, misuse of, or unauthorized access to University data.

Fordham uses Spirion™ (formerly Identity Finder) to identify unprotected sensitive data on desktops, laptops, servers, and other media (excluding mobile phones or tablets) issued by Fordham University. Any sensitive information found is masked and not visible in plain text.

[Learn more about how Fordham uses Spirion here](/information-technology/it-security--assurance/it-security-guides-and-tips/spirion/).Fordham uses CloudLock® to scan Google Drive™ files and Microsoft 365™ DLP to scan Microsoft OneDrive™, SharePoint®, and Microsoft 365 files in the Fordham domain. This ensures that Fordham Protected and Fordham Sensitive data are stored and shared appropriately and securely.

Information Security and Assurance provides full-disk encryption for Fordham-issued desktops, laptops, and removable media encryption for items such as thumb drives, to help safeguard data stored locally on those devices. Encryption involves the process of encoding data or plain text in such a way that only authorized parties can access it. The

[Disk Encryption Policy](/information-technology/it-security--assurance/it-policies-procedures-and-guidelines/disk-encryption-policy/)states Fordham employs disk encryption technologies on the University's IT Resources to protect the confidentiality of information.By encrypting devices such as desktops and laptops, Fordham ensures data confidentiality and integrity on the device, as only the laptop owner can access the locally stored data. The data cannot be modified while “at rest” without credentials. Additionally, if the device is lost or stolen, encryption safeguards the locally stored data from unauthorized access.

Fordham uses McAfee® Drive Encryption on all Fordham-issued desktops, laptops, and McAfee's File and Removable Media Protection for devices such as thumb drives. A request for drive encryption or removable media encryption can be made as a service request using

To augment the email protection features built into Gmail™, Information Security and Assurance employs three email protection services from Proofpoint®: email filtering, malicious URL blocking, and email encryption.

Emails are scanned and filtered for spam (junk email and unsolicited messages sent in bulk) and match known malware and phishing patterns. When a message is identified as potential spam or suspicious, it is quarantined. The recipient is sent a Quarantine Summary email and can view the messages and decide whether to release them to their inbox and mark them as not spam or leave them classified as spam to be deleted.

Fordham faculty and staff are also provided with Targeted Attack Protection (

[TAP](/information-technology/it-security--assurance/information-security-and-assurance-resources/spam-and-phishing/tap-for-employees/)), which analyzes and blocks malicious URLs sent via email messages and attachments.Fordham offers email encryption to secure messages sent to people outside of Fordham, that is, to non-Fordham email addresses. In addition, email communication within the Fordham domains, fordham.edu and law.fordham.edu, is automatically secured while in transit.

Email filtering helps reduce Fordham’s volume of intrusive and unsolicited spam emails. In addition, TAP helps protect Fordham employees from specific threats distributed via email, including phishing and access to malicious websites. Although these email protection services reduce email-borne security risks, caution must still be exercised when reviewing suspicious emails.

Email encryption provides Fordham University employees a method for safeguarding the content of email messages from being read by unintended recipients while in transit. Encryption renders the content of your email (including any attachments) unreadable as it travels from origin to destination.

Potential phishing and malicious emails can be reported with one click from your Fordham Gmail safely and in real-time with the Cofense Reporter™ Gmail add-on or email

[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).For more information on email security services, review webpages on

Endpoint Protection software is installed on all Fordham-owned and managed endpoint devices running Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. An endpoint is any remote device sending and receiving communications within Fordham's network, such as desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones, and servers.


Endpoint protection or endpoint security software is designed to prevent endpoints from being breached and to safeguard against advanced security threats. Endpoint protection software includes antivirus (AV) functionality to detect and remove malware such as viruses, ransomware, trojans, and keyloggers.Fordham uses CrowdStrike Falcon™, an endpoint protection platform that combines antivirus, threat intelligence, endpoint detection and response (EDR), and other IT hygiene products.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) provides password-protected online accounts at Fordham with an additional layer of security. This security enhancement requires you to verify your identity with a 2nd factor, in addition to your password, when logging in to your account. A smartphone, landline, cell phone, tablet, or hardware token may be used to verify your identity.

Passwords that are short, simple, and reused for multiple sites and accounts do not provide adequate protection. Verifying user identity using MFA reduces the risk associated with unauthorized access to accounts, should passwords ever be compromised.

Fordham's MFA service is provided by Duo Security®, a trusted company used by many higher education institutions.

[Learn more about how MFA works](/information-technology/it-security--assurance/information-security-and-assurance-resources/multi-factor-authentication/). -
