Teaching and Thinking with A.I.

Co-presented by

[José Antonio Bowen, Ph.D.](https://josebowen.com/)and[C. Edward Watson, Ph.D.](https://www.eddiewatson.net/), the authors of the upcoming book,[Teaching with AI: A Practical Guide to a New Era of Human Learning](https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/53869/teaching-ai).The excitement (and panic) surrounding A.I. is shattering expectations around assignments, assessment, class preparation and attendance, while challenging us to build more future-proof and inclusive classrooms. AI is rapidly changing how humans work and think. AI is also changing how we think about average and AI is even changing creativity. This session will give you a different way to think about AI and introduce the workshops to come.

To improve the integrity of your in-person exams and reduce distractions we have a solution that simplifies your life and ensures your students are fully engaged during exams. We suggest utilizing the powerful software called Insight, which is installed in the computer labs on campus.

Insight works by “blocking internet access, external drives, and other programs during the exam, Insight creates a focused environment. It provides only necessary software such as a word processor and Blackboard for file uploads.”

This allows the faculty to easily:

- Monitor the classroom screens
- Administer assessments
- Share screens

If you are interested in this mode of examination, you will need to reserve a computer lab for the date and time of your exam, then contact the technical lab managers for guidance on Insight.
