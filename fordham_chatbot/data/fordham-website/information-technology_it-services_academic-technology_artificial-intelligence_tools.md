# Tools

**For Faculty, Staff**

Since the announcement of ChatGPT an industry of GAI detection tools has also been booming. Hundreds - and growing - products claim to be able to differentiate between a GAI text from that of a human being with a various level of accuracy. Yet none seem to be conclusive.

Caution is advised in testing and experimenting with these tools, as in several cases quite a few of them marked a clearly human generated text as that of a GAI and vice versa. Such mistakes could have potential ethical and legal ramifications. Much research and experimentation is needed to these tools as this industry is still in its development

In addition, you need to be careful with what type of data you share. Avoid putting you and your students' data into any AI system. When utilizing AI tools, bear in mind the importance of understanding regulations and policies governing Fordham Protected and Fordham Sensitive Data. Fordham University’s Data Classification and Protection Policy applies to all data produced, collected, stored, or used by the University, its employees, student workers, consultants, and agents during their relationship with the University.

For information about the difference between sensitive, protected, and public data please visit [Fordham's Data Classification Guidelines](https://www.fordham.edu/information-technology/it-security--assurance/it-policies-procedures-and-guidelines/data-classification-guidelines/).
