# Computer Teaching Labs

**For Students, Faculty, Staff**

## Overview

Educational Technology Research Computing maintains learning labs on Fordham University's three campuses. These facilities provide space for instructors to teach classes that require the use of computers and to provide students with access to computing.

Specialized learning labs on the Rose Hill and Lincoln Center campuses are also available. They are designated for teaching specific applications and may only be used for those purposes.

## Classroom Management Software (Insight)

For faculty who wish to conduct an in-person exam with an extra level of security, Fordham offers a software called Faronics Insight installed in a few of our labs.

Insight works by “blocking internet access, external drives, and other programs during the exam, Insight creates a focused environment. It provides only necessary software such as a word processor and Blackboard for file uploads.”

This allows the faculty to easily:

- Monitor the classroom screens
- Administer assessments
- Share screens

If you are interested in this mode of examination, you will need to reserve a computer lab for the date and time of your exam, then contact the technical lab managers for guidance on Insight.

Lincoln Center:

Lowenstein 304, 305, 306, 309, and 312

Rose Hill:

Keating 317, 318, 320, Language Lab (basement)
