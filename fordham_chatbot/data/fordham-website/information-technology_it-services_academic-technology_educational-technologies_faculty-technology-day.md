Discernment is a fundamental and distinguishing element of Jesuit education, rooted in the Spiritual Exercises and integral to Ignatian Pedagogy. It is a holistic, ongoing process of spiritual and intellectual reflection that guides individuals and institutions like Fordham in making choices that contribute to the well-being of the human community, and helps us form “men and women for others.” The process involves not only intellectual analysis but also engaging the heart, carefully reflecting on motives and values, and considering the impact of decisions.

With that in mind, as we find ourselves in the age of AI, what happens if we confront the concerns and the opportunities of AI with that Ignatian tradition of discernment?

Through this perspective, we are called neither to uncritically embrace nor reflexively reject AI, but to thoughtfully evaluate – with heart and mind – how these tools might serve our commitment to human dignity and the common good. Ignatian discernment invites us to consider:

- How can AI enhance rather than replace the transformative human relationships at the heart of education?
- How might these technologies help us better fulfill our mission of
*cura personalis*– caring for the whole person – while remaining vigilant against their potential to reduce human complexity to algorithms?

The Jesuit tradition of finding meaning in all aspects of our experience challenges us to discern value even in these new technologies while maintaining critical awareness of how they shape our communities and institutions.

Faculty Technology Day 2025 invites our community to explore these questions together through engaging discussions with a diverse array of thought leaders and educators. We hope you’ll join us in this important conversation.

Author of[Universities on Fire](https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/12668/universities-fire?srsltid=AfmBOore6XOz1AgjzieJ424sN7TcL4qz-cXwN7F8jeLV7ea1CZXug-yC)(2023) and[Academia Next: The Futures of Higher Education](https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/12088/academia-next)(2022), as well as the creator of[The Future of Higher Education Observatory](https://futureofeducation.us/). ([Full bio](https://bryanalexander.org/bio/))In this keynote address, Dr. Alexander asks: What is AI doing to higher education, and how are academics responding?

This session offers several possible futures for academic AI, grounded in the present. We begin by noting the differences between generative AI and other technologies in the education space, then set the stage by exploring several macro-level trends and possibilities: the fragility of AI; the open source world; impacts on the labor market; the geopolitical dimension. Next, we survey leading trends in college and university engagement, from operational use to teaching and research. We conclude by offering several scenarios for higher education in the medium-term future, based on how AI develops and what actions we take.

## Breakout Session 2

-
Jude Jones, Ph.D.


Associate Professor of Philosophy at Fordham University and Special Advisor to the Provost For Teaching and Learning, Fordham UniversityThis presentation will argue that the ethical issues we as faculty see in our students' encounter with AI can only be addressed at a level much more fundamental than the functional questions of how to prevent cheating and how to protect students' cognitive skills from erosion. How to use AI with creativity and integrity is secondary to the question of how to be a thinker with creative and authentic objectives at all. Ignatian Discernment unfolds a pedagogy of self-awareness that is alert to the energies inside each of us that move us to cheat or create, and this talk will explore what this needs to mean to the academic culture at Fordham from the first day students set foot on campus, and on all days of our lives as faculty.

This session was recorded and is currently under review. The video will be posted here as soon as it’s ready. Thank you for your patience!
