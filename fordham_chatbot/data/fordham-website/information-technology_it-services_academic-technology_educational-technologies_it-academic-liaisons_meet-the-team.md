Heather is especially passionate about digital humanities, accessibility, and user experience, and is excited to help the Fordham community implement these ideas in their work.

Heather has a background in library and information science (MSLIS, Pratt Institute) and medieval studies (MA, Fordham University). She has had broad training in digital humanities tools, including mapping platforms, text analysis, photo analysis, and information visualization, and has conducted methodological research regarding the history of digital humanities and the difficulties of digital historical mapping.

Shawn works with faculty across Fordham’s many schools and departments to encourage the use of innovative digital technology in the classroom.

By consulting with faculty and helping them integrate new tools into their classes, Shawn helps Fordham faculty offer students new and creative approaches to existing assignments that foster critical thinking. Shawn goes into classrooms, teaches the new technology to the students and serves as their support backstop so faculty can focus on assessing student writing, creativity, and intellectual growth - and not on supporting the technology.

Shawn brings 32 years of teaching experience in 7 countries in North America, Europe, and Asia, combined with a background in visual arts, geography, ESL, and technology, to his position.
