## Best Practices

**Avoid green clothing or patterns containing green.**

- A green screen is used for background insertions, and green clothing may pass video through.

**Avoid very dark clothing if using the light board function.**

- You may blend into the black background.

**Run a test recording.**

- If it’s your first time using the One Button Studio, schedule a time in advance to start a test recording and test the various features available on the touch screen to get accustomed to the options available and how they look on the recorded file.

**Have a script.**

- Have a script prepared before arriving.
- Practicing your script beforehand allows for a more natural-sounding flow.
- A script will also make the recording easier and possibly shorter, as you will have already fully considered your points and will have a reference if needed.

## FAQs

-
*If you are using PowerPoint, Keynote, or any other media for making a presentation during a recording, it’s helpful to follow some general rules about font, color, and any photos you may be including. Keep slides as simple as possible, and avoid flashy transitions or animations unless necessary.*- Design your PPT to an all-black background.
- Use high-res images on your PowerPoint.
- Be sure to describe the images in your video, include captions, and follow

There are two displays - a ‘flex’ display and a ‘confidence monitor’ display.

-
- The
*flex*display shows the local PC built into the one-button studio. You can log into this PC using your usual Fordham login credentials, browse the web, or use Office and other desktop applications. This display will not be recorded and is intended to hold your notes or content you don’t want the viewer to see. - The
*confidence*display shows precisely what the one-button studio will record to the USB flash drive. The built-in PC has a second video output sent to this monitor.- To record/show content here, drag the window you’d like to record from the left
*flex*display to the right*confidence*display.

The one-button studio will treat

**full black**backgrounds on PowerPoints or browsers as transparent and pass the camera signal through. This means that if you make your PowerPoint background black and the text or images white, red, blue, gray, etc., you will have floating text with your camera feed displaying. This allows you to point and write over the content without being obscured. -
No software is needed to use the One Button Studio. It saves the video file as an industry-standard MP4 to a USB flash drive which can be uploaded to

*Panopto*or*Youtube,*or shared directly to your viewers via file sharing services such as*Google Drive*or*Microsoft OneDrive*, both of which are available on the*My Apps*portal on[fordham.edu](https://fordham.edu). -
We provide a USB-C flash drive tethered to the control panel for recording. You can also provide

[your own USB flash drive](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-128GB-Ultra-Drive-Type-C/dp/B07YYJRXQR). You can transfer this file out of the One Button Studio via your Fordham-provided Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive by visiting the portal and then dragging the file to the storage service you choose. You may also use your own laptop to copy the file from the built-in USB-C flash drive if so equipped. -
While editing is not required, you may want to cut out sections of the recording or add additional content. We suggest the web-based app

*Panopto*, offered free to all members of the University. It can ingest the file created by the One Button Studio and offers built-in editing capabilities. For more information about*Panopto*, please visit[fordham.edu/panopto](https://www.fordham.edu/panopto/)or contact the IT Service Desk at (718) 817-3999. IT Service Desk staff is also available at the LITE center’s front desk. -
