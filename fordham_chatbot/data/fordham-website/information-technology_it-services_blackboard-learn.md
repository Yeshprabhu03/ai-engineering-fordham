# Blackboard Learn

**For Students, Faculty, Staff**

## Overview

Blackboard is Fordham University's learning management system, which can be accessed at any time from any computer with an Internet connection via [Fordham's Blackboard portal](https://fordham.blackboard.com/). Faculty and students in on- and off-campus courses use this application as a repository for course material and information.

Instructors can manage all course materials online, making them immediately accessible to students. All members of a course can use Blackboard for online discussions, to collaborate on projects, share files, send emails, and much more.

## Course Merge

If you are teaching multiple sections of the same course you can fill out this form to request a course merge: [Course Merge Request form.](https://fordham.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=6187200597bc82107551bff3a253afcb&sysparm_category=4a74828d97f6d1107551bff3a253af07)

Please note:

- We recommend you request your course merges as early as possible.
- Do not begin working on your courses before they are merged, as the merged course will be blank upon its creation (i.e., content in the individual sections is deleted in the course merge process).
- Last be aware that if you request courses to be merged that already include publisher content, then the publishers will need to be contacted to “unlink” the courses so that you can set up the publisher content in the merged course (e.g. Cengage, Oxford, Barnes And Noble, Kritik, Pearson, McMillion, and Voicethread).

- Course shells appear on Blackboard at least one week before the start of the new semester.
- Banner automatically adds registered students to Blackboard courses. Students who drop a course will not be unenrolled but listed as unavailable.
