When you send emails to the users in your course, you will receive an email with your name only, but the email would have been sent to all the users you selected. The only way to verify is by asking your students.

Another option you can use on Blackboard is creating an announcement, and checking off the box to send email as well. The announcement will be posted to your Blackboard course, and an email will be sent to the roster of students listed in your Blackboard course.

This provides 2 areas for your students to view your message, if they access your Blackboard course it will appear on the Announcement Page, and if they check their email they will receive a message there as well. Creating an announcement and checking off the box to send an email is the only way to see a record of what was sent via Blackboard.

A few weeks before the end of the term you'll receive an email from the Office of Academic Records advising you to enter grades prior to the deadline stated in the Academic Calendar.

Blackboard is to be used during the term to provide a status update to students enrolled in each course, however, it is not the official system of student records, thus, while you can provide a final grade on BB, you also must submit a final grade on the portal/Banner by the stated deadline.

To submit your official final grades in Banner:- Sign into the Fordham portal (at
[fordham.edu](http://fordham.edu/)) - Select "My Pages" and click on "Faculty"
- Click on "Faculty Services Dashboard" and then you'll see a link to "Enter Final Grades Here." You'll also see a link on that page with instructions for entering your final grades.

If you have any questions about entering final grades through the Faculty Services Dashboard, you will need to contact Academic Records at[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#72131113160017111d00160132141d00161a131f5c171607). - Sign into the Fordham portal (at
