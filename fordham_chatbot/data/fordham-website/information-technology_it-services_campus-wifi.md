Fordham University allows connectivity to the network on all major game consoles and most media streaming devices (i.e., Roku, Apple TV, etc.). These devices are supported on both the wired and wireless networks. Media streaming devices that require a P2P (Peer to Peer) connection between devices on the network, such as Chromecasts, are currently not supported.

Steps for connecting your devices are:

For Wireless Devices

- Access the
[Multimedia Device Registration Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdC8zQje9v__jRzEhW0zW5PQgM5cPeYIllasXrekkklAS45kw/viewform)by logging in with your Fordham username and password. - Navigate to your device's network settings and
[obtain the wireless MAC address](/information-technology/it-services/campus-wifi/wifi-mac-address/). - Complete the form and click on Submit.
- Your device will be registered within 4 business hours.
- Once registered, connect your device to the FordhamGuest wireless network.

For Wired Devices

- Connect your game console or media device to the wired ethernet jack in your dorm room.
- Confirm that you have network connectivity. If you encounter any problems, please contact the
[IT Service Desk](/information-technology/it-services/technology-support/)for further assistance.

Registered devices will become inactive at the end of each year on June 30th. You will need to re-register your device at the beginning of each year. You can start re-registering your device as soon as July 1st.

Info Tech highly recommends the use of a wired ethernet connection in your dorm room (instead of wireless) in order to ensure a more reliable connection.
