## Internet Access

Telephone and TV service providers offer the best Internet access for consumers. They can equip your household with an Internet modem, which connects to your computer via an ethernet cable, or a wireless router. A WiFi hotspot may be used as an alternative connection. It allows your computer to connect to the Internet using cellular networks from providers such as T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon. **A hotspot, however, might not provide enough bandwidth to meet your needs and therefore should be used only as a short-term solution.** For help with choosing a way to connect to the Internet, contact IT Service Center.

**Which browser should I use?**

- Use the most current version of Chrome or Firefox. Allow these browsers to update automatically. These browsers work well with Blackboard, Panopto and Fordham's other web-based tools. For best results, install both browsers in case one of them isn't working with an online application.
- Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, and Safari are not recommended because they may not be compatible with many of Fordham's applications and systems.

**My PC uses Windows 7. Is that ok?**

Microsoft no longer supports Windows 7, and therefore it should not be used due to security concerns and compatibility issues with Fordham applications. Moreover, the IT Service Desk may not be able to support you if you run into a problem. For assistance with upgrading your PC to Windows 10, contact the IT Service Desk.
