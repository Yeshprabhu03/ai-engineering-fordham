# Fordham Additional Storage

**For Faculty, Staff**

## Overview

Fordham storage is web-based file storage hosted on site, available to faculty and staff. There are two storage platforms available: shared.fordham (for sharing files with others) and storage.fordham (for single-user file access and storage).

## Shared.fordham

With shared.fordham, you can store and share files with people at Fordham and outside users.

See instructions here: [Shared.fordham - User Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ILudTDvpEf_PJnZ3gWDCTOidoNWEcMNJRXKLzKefMQs/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.nnnl7d1gtagt)

See instructions here: [Migrating files from Google Drive to Nextcloud Guide](https://scribehow.com/shared/Migrating_files_from_Google_Drive_to_Nextcloud_Guide__u8xrgdcISHOX5E7AkoHkJg)

Faculty and staff can request space via the [Shared.Fordham Storage Request form](https://fordham.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&table=sc_cat_item&sys_id=09d0367847d6d6d05a9a96f5036d4395), subject to IT review and approval. If approved for shared.fordham, additional fees may apply and be billed to your department.

Access it via [shared.fordham.edu](http://shared.fordham.edu) on any browser from on or off campus.

## Storage.fordham

All full-time faculty and staff automatically have access to 100 GB of space on storage.fordham. Additional space can be requested, though additional fees may apply.

At storage.fordham, you can store files the same as with shared.fordham, but there is no sharing ability.
