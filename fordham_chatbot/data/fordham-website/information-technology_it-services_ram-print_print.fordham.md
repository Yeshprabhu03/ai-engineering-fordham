# Ram Print

**For Students, Faculty, Staff, Guests**

## Overview

Ram Print is Fordham University's managed print service, allowing Faculty, Staff, Students, and Guests to securely print, copy, or scan materials at any Ram Print device. It includes a networked, multi-function device print platform available in departments, residence halls, and the library. It reduces costs by limiting the need for personal desktop printers, fax machines, hallway copiers, and scanners.

Faculty, staff, students, and guests all use the same Canon printers through the PaperCut printing software.
