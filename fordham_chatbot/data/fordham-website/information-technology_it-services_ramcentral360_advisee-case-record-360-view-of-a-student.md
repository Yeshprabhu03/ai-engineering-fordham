# Advisee Case Record: 360 View of a Student

**For Advisors**

## Overview

The Advisee Case record is where you’ll see the 360 degree view of the student and most relevant information you need to advise your students.

To navigate to the Advisee Case record, select the case number from the My Advisees list view. When you open a case record, it opens under the student contact record, so you will always see the name of the student in the tab at the top.

**Note**: In order for a student to show up in your My Advisees view, you must be listed as a member of their Success Team. Advisor Assignments are assigned from the Banner Integration. If you are not on their Success Team (i.e. Dean or other school staff), you can access the case by searching for the student in the Global Search bar at the top of your screen.
