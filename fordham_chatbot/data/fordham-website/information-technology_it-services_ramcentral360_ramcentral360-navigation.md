**For Advisors**

## Overview

Leveraging the power of the Salesforce platform, Fordham Hub for Advisors is an advising platform that enables students to connect with a network of advisors, their “Success Team.” It provides the tools and data for advisors to support the advising process for deeper student engagement and success.

Fordham academic advisors, class deans, and academic support staff will access the Advising Application. The Fordham Hub can be found on the fordham.edu **MyPages \ Advisors**, or the **MyApps** page. Click on **The Fordham Hub**.
