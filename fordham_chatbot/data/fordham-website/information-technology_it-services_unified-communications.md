# Unified Communications

**For Faculty, Staff**

## Overview

Fordham's Unified Communications includes intercampus, local and long-distance calling from desktop phones, faxing, and teleconferencing services. Training for using any part of the system is available on request.

To make an emergency call from your university phone, dial 9 + 911.

## Services

For all service requests related to Unified Communications, please contact the IT Service Desk. To route your request to the proper group, the help team may need your extension number and the type of handset you use.

### Teleconferencing

The options below describe telephone-based conference calls using the Cisco handset or a dial-in service.

-
Conference Now is available for up to 6 callers (host and 5 guests), and may be used with any phone (including mobile phones). Conference hosts use their 5-digit telephone extension (which is the meeting code) to enable a teleconference call. Hosts must set a PIN for the conference system in advance; this only needs to be done once and must be done on campus.
