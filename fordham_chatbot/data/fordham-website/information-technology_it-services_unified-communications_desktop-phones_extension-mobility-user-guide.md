# Extension Mobility User Guide

**For Faculty, Staff**

## Overview

In your role here at Fordham, do you find yourself working from multiple locations? Or maybe you share a desk and phone with a colleague? Wouldn’t it be nice if you could have your office phone number move around with you? With Extension Mobility, you can!

You can sign into any Cisco 8851 phone in the Fordham University network and have it act the same as your office phone with Extension Mobility (EM). After you sign in, the phone adopts your user profile, including your phone lines, features, established services, and web-based settings.
