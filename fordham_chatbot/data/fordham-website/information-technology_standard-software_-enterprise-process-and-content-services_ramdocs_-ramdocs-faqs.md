Before getting started with designing solutions familiarize yourself with the

[Data Classification and Protection Policy](https://www.fordham.edu/information-technology/it-security--assurance/it-policies-procedures-and-guidelines/data-classification-and-protection-policy/)If you need to collect/manage information owned by a different group it is best to connect with the data owner in advance. Before a form is released for production use, the Enterprise Process and Content Services team will review the form. In some cases, there may be a need for the Office of Information Assurance (ISA) to review as well. Data collection and storage must be in support of a business need.

Forms and workflows must be compliant with the University’s FERPA policy.

- Build forms and workflows for your own department based on good practices and guidelines.
- RamDocs is WCAG/Section 508 compliant except for a subset of fields that are not supported. These field options are not available to the Fordham community. These fields will often be flagged as problematic on the designer tool.
- Date/Time field: use separate fields to collect date and time if needed
- Address Block: do not collect the entire address in one field–create short answer fields to collect address line 1, address line 2, city, state, and zip
- “Add Other” option for radio buttons and checkboxes. You can add a short answer box for “other” information
- Signature box. You can create a short answer field with an agreement, and the user can type their name

- Forms and documents should be maintained and audited frequently. Ensure your solutions are current.
