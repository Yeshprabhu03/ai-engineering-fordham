### Before You Begin Creating Forms

Please read the following before you start developing a form.

[Contact IT Service Desk](/information-technology/it-services/technology-support/)with the following information to create the Unity Form document type:- Document Type requested (e.g., AR Transcript Request)
- Keywords to retrieve the document in the future (e.g., FIDN, First Name, Last Name, Vendor, FY). Keywords can be free text or configured with a drop down/select list.

- Once your request is received, you will be set as a forms developer in UT1/TEST. Configure and validate your form in this area.
- Notify the Enterprise Process and Content Services team via email to
[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4b2824253f2e253f382e393d22282e380b2d24392f232a26652e2f3e)when the form is complete, and they will move the forms to production.

**Note:** Ask the Enterprise Process team for assistance when

- Your form requires a workflow for routing/approvals, or contains email notifications that will be triggered by the process.
- Your business case calls for an authenticated form. ECM will help you draft the specs to call the data from the system of record (e.g., Banner/PowerFAIDS) and/or if data needs to post from the form to the system of record/target system.

For assistance contact The Enterprise Process and Content Services team at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#680b07061c0d061c1b0d1a1e010b0d1b280e071a0c000905460d0c1d).
