# Role-Based Email Accounts

**For Students, Faculty, Staff, Alumni**

## Overview

Members of Fordham University are now provided with **role-based email addresses** that specifically correspond to their role at the university as **student**/**alumni** or **employee**. As a result, individuals with multiple roles at the university receive two email accounts: one for work and one for student or alumni activities. This keeps work communications separate and secure from student-related activities.

## Primary vs Role-Based Email Accounts

All members of the Fordham community are provided with a ** primary email account **based on their primary role. Members of the community who have two roles at the university are also provided with a

**second role-based email account**in addition to their primary email account.

You will use your **primary account** for all communications relating to your primary role. For Fordham-provided services requiring you to log in (like the portal, Blackboard, DegreeWorks, Banner, etc.), you must use your primary Fordham account. [Manage your primary account](/information-technology/it-services/fordham-username/).

You will use your **second role-based email account** for all communications relating to your second role in accordance with the [Role-Based Email Accounts Policy](/information-technology/it-security--assurance/it-policies-procedures-and-guidelines/role-based-email-accounts-policy/). Set up your second role-based email account following the instructions below.
