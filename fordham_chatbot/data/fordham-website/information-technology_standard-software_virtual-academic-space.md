### Recommended network connection and saving files

- For an optimal experience with Azure Virtual Desktop, make sure you have a high bandwidth Internet connection.
- A wired connection is preferred but not necessary. WiFi connections may be used, but graphics-intensive applications such as Adobe Premiere may function with delays. Smartphone hotspots are not recommended.
- A Round Trip Time (RTT) of 150ms or lower is recommended for display performance.
- If you are experiencing a sluggish display or input response, check your RTT (Average Latency (ms)) from your device to the
**East US Azure Region**via the[Azure Latency Test](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/virtual-desktop/assessment/#estimation-tool). Under**US**select**East US.**

- Save your work frequently, especially if your network connection is unreliable. Save your work to your desktop or documents folder on your hard drive. This will ensure access to those files even when your session is disrupted due to a poor network connection.
- Before you begin working with files in the Virtual Academic Space: If you're using cloud storage services to access your files, such as OneDrive and Google Drive, copy or drag the files from Cloud Drive to your desktop.
- It is recommended that you save all your data to your OneDrive.

- Each workspace will create its unique user profile. Data saved to your profile in the Standard Desktop and GPU Desktop will not be accessible between each other. Please save data to your OneDrive, Google Drive, or local device if it needs to be accessible in each workspace.


### User Data Policy

While data saved to your profile (Documents and Desktop folder) is persistent for at least the semester, it is limited to 30GB, please save your data to your OneDrive, Google Drive and/or save it to your device to reduce the chance of data loss. We are not responsible for any data lost in these lab Virtual Academic Spaces. Please save important data outside the environment using the previously mentioned options.
