Record your meetings to the cloud if you intend to share them with others. Meetings recorded to the cloud will produce an automatic transcript. The option to record to the cloud will appear when you initiate the recording. Zoom cloud recordings will be deleted from Zoom after 90 days. Cloud recordings are deleted after 30 days. Use

[Panopto to store, view, and share your recordings](https://www.fordham.edu/information-technology/standard-software/panopto/)for an unlimited time.Before posting your recording, it must be ADA compliant. Review the transcript for accuracy; this is the only way you can be sure it's ADA compliant. The transcript can be displayed within the video itself, similar to a closed captions display.

*If you plan to share your recording with others, please do not record it locally.* -
