# Accessibility at Fordham

Fordham University is committed to ensuring that our campus, programs, and digital environments are accessible to all, including individuals with disabilities.

To advance this commitment, the University established an Accessibility Committee in July 2019. This committee brings together representatives from across the University to identify barriers, recommend solutions, and promote best practices in accessibility.

Through these efforts, Fordham continues to work toward becoming a fully accessible and inclusive institution, where every member of our community can thrive.

## The Accessibility Committee

The Fordham University Accessibility Committee is dedicated to fostering fully inclusive learning, working, and living environments across all University campuses.

Our mission is to raise awareness that accessibility is a shared responsibility—one that belongs to the entire Fordham community. We are committed to ensuring that the University provides the resources, support, and infrastructure necessary for every student, faculty member, and staff member to fully engage with Fordham’s content, pedagogy, technology, and facilities.

Through collaboration and continuous improvement, we strive to make Fordham University a model of accessibility and inclusion.

### Strategic Goals

- Educate the community on the importance of accessibility best practices and principles
- Ensure the community (including visitors) can use, engage, and interact with our content, pedagogy, resources, and facilities
- Encourage an ‘accessibility first’ perspective on a university-wide level including content and design from digital communication to physical construction
- Identify areas where improvement and changes are needed and provide resources and assistance to those with disabilities

Additional information and resources will be shared as it is available.
