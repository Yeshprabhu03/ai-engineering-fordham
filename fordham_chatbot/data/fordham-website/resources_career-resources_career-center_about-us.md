# About the Career Center

The formative experiences you will have at Fordham, from study abroad to service opportunities to simply being challenged and inspired by your professors and fellow students, will change you in ways that may feel hard to put into words.

That’s where the Career Center comes in. We serve as the bridge between your classroom experience and the world beyond, helping you to understand the extraordinary value and relevance of your Fordham education—and ensuring employers do, too.

Whether we’re helping you edit your resume, find an internship, network with employers, or learn about new developments in our rapidly-changing economy, everything we do is based on Cura Personalis- the care of the whole student . To put it simply, we work to help you:

- become aware of what your skills are
- see how they apply to the world of work
- learn how they differentiate you from other candidates for your career of choice
