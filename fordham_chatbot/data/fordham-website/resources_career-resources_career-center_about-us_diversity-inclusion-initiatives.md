# Career Center Diversity Inclusion Initiatives

Principles of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging are central to [our mission as a Jesuit institution](/about/living-the-mission/diversity-and-inclusion/) and connect us to a long Catholic tradition of advocating for the dignity and worth of every person.

In addition to online resources and one-on-one career counseling, the Career Center for Cura Personalis offers programming designed to connect students and employers in key conversations on equity and inclusion. Students of any interest, identity, or academic background are welcome to attend these events, and employers have the opportunity to attend and sponsor these programs.

## Annual programs

### Networking Banquet

The Networking Banquet is the Career Center's oldest inclusion program and has been held annually since 2003. Every fall, the banquet invites keynote speakers and employers to share their professional experiences with a selected topic in the world of work. Previous speakers have included Anthony Carter, Former Chief Diversity Officer Johnson & Johnson, FCRH ’76 , Author Kevin Powell and Congressman Jose É Serrano, Bronx New York, Kimberly Hardy Watson, CEO Graham Windham, FCRH ‘84, Stephen L. Ball, Dean of Students at Harvard Law School and more!

### Pop-Up Career Closet

The Pop-Up Career Closet aims to create a more equitable workplace by allowing students to receive professional attire for interviews, career fairs, networking events, internships, and more at no cost. This event is typically held at the beginning of each semester, and the Career Center welcomes donations from employers and community partners year-round for professional attire in all sizes.

### Student Club Expo / Reverse Career Fair

Launched in 2023, the Student Club Expo / Reverse Career Fair flips the model of a traditional career fair with student groups tabling instead of employers. This unique structure allows recruiters to meet student leaders from a wide array of on-campus organizations and hear about their work and accomplishments.

### Panels

The Career Center regularly partners with the Office of Multicultural Affairs, Counseling Psychological Services, Office of Disability Services, and other Fordham departments and student organizations in developing and offering employer panels on topics related to professional development and growth. Previous panels have covered a wide range of inclusion topics, from neurodiversity to cultural identity, and have featured partners from Deloitte, KPMG, RSM, Clarins, Graham and more.
