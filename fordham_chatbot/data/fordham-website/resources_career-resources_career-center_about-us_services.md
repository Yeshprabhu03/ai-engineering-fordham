We understand that last-minute schedule changes and emergencies happen. However, to be able to provide the best service to all of our students, we require the following:

**Appointment cancellation**If you can no longer make it to your scheduled appointment, you must cancel it in Handshake by 8 a.m. ET the morning of your appointment. If you are no longer able to make it after this point, you must send an email to your counselor notifying them of the cancellation prior to the start of the appointment, in addition to canceling it within Handshake.

**Late arrival policy**If you are late to your counseling appointment, we are unable to extend your appointment and can only meet with you for the remainder of your scheduled session. If you arrive more than 15 minutes late, you will have to reschedule your session or it will be counted as a no-show.

**No-show policy**If you do not cancel your appointment prior to the start of the session and do not show up, it will be recorded as a no-show. If three or more “no-shows” are recorded in a semester, your ability to schedule appointments will be restricted for the rest of that semester until you complete a meeting with an Associate Director of Student Engagement.
