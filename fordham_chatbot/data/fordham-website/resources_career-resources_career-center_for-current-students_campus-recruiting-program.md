# Career Center Campus Recruitment Program

Our Campus Recruiting Program (OCR) gives you a chance interview on-campus for internship and full-time job opportunities with exciting companies. You can apply for these opportunities via [Handshake](http://app.joinhandshake.com/), and if you're selected, you'll receive an invitation to interview on campus!

In order to gain access to OCR jobs, you'll have to watch our OCR Campus Recruiting orientation [online](https://youtu.be/SJC4WizLCRY?si=dffbU-cdwa5Bv1go). After watching the video, complete the on-campus interview policy acknowledgment. [Click here to gain access.](https://app.joinhandshake.com/edu/surveys/78436)

**Campus Recruiting policy**

Unexcused absences and last-minute cancellations do not enhance your image with potential employers and weaken the integrity and reputation of Fordham University and the On-Campus Recruitment Program. Your actions can also jeopardize the entire recruiting program for future students. Thus, a strict policy regarding "no shows," "cancellations," and job offers will be enforced for the protection of the students of Fordham University.

We ask that you carefully review the [Campus Recruiting Policy.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16tukyzLPuJiHS3Qi5zkq6gUhiWrDKRz3FtMKMIzLTBI/edit?usp=sharing)

***All students must read and agree to the terms and conditions by providing signatures on the On-Campus Recruitment Student Policy. Failure to comply with the following above will risk the loss of your on-campus recruitment privileges.*
