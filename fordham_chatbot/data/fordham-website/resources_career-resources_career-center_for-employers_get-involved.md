# Employers: Get Involved With Our Students

Whether you're looking to recruit for a currently open position or build brand awareness to foster relationships with up-and-coming potential candidates, the Fordham Career Center offers a variety of opportunities for involvement to meet your organization's recruitment needs.

**Handshake**

Handshake is our one-stop portal for career management! Employers are able to post jobs and internships, message students through in-platform inboxes, and register to attend career fairs and other events. Sign up for Handshake today by visiting [app.joinhandshake.com](https://app.joinhandshake.com/)*Contact: Kathlene Mullaney, [email protected] *

**Career fairs & large scale events**

Career Fairs and other large-scale events, like our Diversity Banquet, are an opportunity to showcase your current opportunities while simultaneously networking with hundreds of students. The Career Center offers both all-industry events, like the Internship Fair and Spring Career Fair, and tailored events to specific industries and initiatives, including the annual Networking Banquet and Veterans. Career Fair registrants can also consider becoming a Pipeline Partner (see below). *Contact: Greg Triandis, [email protected] For information on the Diversity Banquet: Brittany Perez, [email protected] *

**Tabling & info sessions**

Tabling and information sessions are great opportunities to make a strong introduction to students! Tabling in a high-traffic area can help build your brand awareness and knowledge of current opportunities or upcoming events. Information sessions are a deeper dive into your organization’s programs, structure, and culture. Tabling and information sessions are managed through Handshake.*Contact: Brittany Perez, [email protected] *

**Coffee chats & interview days**

Coffee chats and interview days are the best ways to develop individual relationships with students. While coffee chats are more informal and ideal for determining potential candidates, interview days are optimal for simplifying a crucial component of the formal recruitment process. Both coffee chats and interview days are organized with support from the Career Center in logistics, promotion, and day-of assistance.*Contact: Michael Persaud, [email protected]*

**Site visits**

Site visits provide students with the opportunity to get an insider look at potential employers. By providing students with a look into a day in the life, employers are able to increase interest and visibility in the recruiting process while developing stronger connections with their potential candidates.*Contact: Avery O'Rourke, [email protected] *

**Panels & networking events**

The Career Center routinely hosts panels and networking events targeted to specific industries as well as student demographics, such as first generation students. These events allow you to showcase the opportunities your organization can provide to students in these interest areas, as well as develop meaningful connections with potential candidates.*Contact: Kathlene Mullaney, [email protected] *

**Fireside chats**Fireside chats are an innovative way for employers to connect with prospective talent in an informal setting, providing a platform for representatives to share their organization’s story, values, opportunities, and culture through authentic dialogue. These chats are typically 30–60 minutes and feature an organization representative in conversation with the organization’s interviewer or Career Center moderator, followed by interactive audience engagement.

Registrants gain access to a resume book prior to the fair, which they can use to invite students to coffee chats in advance. On the day of the fair, pipeline partners receive a designated interview room to host their coffee chats. pipeline partner registration includes up to three representatives to attend the career fair, lunch, and refreshments throughout the day.
