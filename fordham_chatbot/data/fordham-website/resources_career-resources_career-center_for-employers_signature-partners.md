# Fordham Career Center Signature Partnership Program

The Fordham Career Center’s Signature Partnership Program is an opportunity for organizations to make the most of their recruiting efforts. By establishing a formal partnership, the Career Center is able to provide tailored, continuous support in recruiting strategy on both campuses. Signature Partners can build strong brand awareness and relationships with Fordham students through branding and engagement opportunities. The generous support of each of the Signature Partners is essential for maintaining the robust professional development offerings of the Career Center.
