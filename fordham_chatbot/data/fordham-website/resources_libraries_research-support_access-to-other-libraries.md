Other major New York collections are accessible using METRO cards. If both Fordham and the New York Public Library do not own the material you need, you may apply to the Reference Desk for a yellow pass to a library that owns a particular item. You may also apply for a blue pass to a library with strong holdings in your subject area. Many museums and learned societies maintain libraries. Ask a reference librarian about them.
