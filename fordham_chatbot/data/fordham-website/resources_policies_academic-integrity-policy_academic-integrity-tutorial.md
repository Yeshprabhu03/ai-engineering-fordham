# Academic Integrity Tutorial

The Academic Integrity Tutorial is an online presentation designed to help students understand issues related to academic integrity in general, and the Undergraduate Policy on Academic Integrity in particular. It explores what it means to plagiarize, cheat, and misrepresent scholarly work with examples and interesting illustrations. In addition, the Tutorial provides strategies that can be used to improve academic efforts and avoid committing academic offenses.

The deadline for completing the Tutorial for 2015-2016 is Friday, September 18, 2015. All incoming freshmen must complete and pass the Academic Integrity Tutorial by the deadline in order to receive the special six-digit advising PIN needed to register for the spring semester.
