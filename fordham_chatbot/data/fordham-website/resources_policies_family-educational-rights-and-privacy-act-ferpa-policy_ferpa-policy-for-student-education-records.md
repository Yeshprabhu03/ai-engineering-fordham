# FERPA Policy for Student Education Records

## I. Statement of Policy

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), as amended, is a federal law which provides regulations regarding the access, review, amendment, and disclosure of student education records. FERPA provides a student with the right to inspect and review his/her education records, to challenge the contents therein, to request a hearing if the outcome of the challenge is considered unsatisfactory, and to submit explanatory statements for inclusion in the education records if the student determines that the decision of the hearing panel is unacceptable. FERPA also regulates the disclosure of student education records to other parties.
