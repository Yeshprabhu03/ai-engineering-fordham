# Office Supplies

** **Fordham’s contract is with Staples Business Advantage (SBA)** NOT with Staples.com or Staples Direct, which are separate retail divisions. Our contract with SBA is designed and geared for commercial clients, not retail consumer store purchases or retail internet purchases.

The Fordham Staples Best Value Custom Catalog has been carefully designed with you in mind. The catalog offers a variety of office support products that will help you get your work done without investing too much of your valuable time shopping for a product. Simply pick your product and utilize our E-Commerce Staples Advantage ordering system. If you do not find what you are looking for in this catalog, please call our Staples On-Site Customer Service Representative at x4733.

Our Contract Specialist, Shonda Nesbitt, supervises the program and is available to address any concerns you may have pertaining to the program and the Staples On-Site Representative.

Ms. Nesbitt has reviewed and analyzed the list of Fordham’s Best Value products. She has updated the selection and priced them in a very aggressive manner. All other products in the catalog are also discounted according to the product category. This assures you of a competitive price for all your office supply requirements.

**Note: Prices shown in the catalog are list prices, not Fordham’s discounted prices.**

The University’s Purchasing Department continuously monitors high usage prices; however, there are instances when a Staples “sale” price or a Staples “closeout” price may be lower. If you have a question about price, availability of items, delivery issues, or questions about the catalog, please speak to the Staples On-Site Customer Service Representative.

The On-Site Customer Service Representative is responsible for processing all orders via Staples Advantage. The Staples On-Site Representative has a dedicated number for your convenience 718-817-4733. He/she is available to answer your inquiries pertaining to products, expediting, returns, billing issues, etc., and is scheduled to be on-site Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. This schedule will ensure that all orders are processed by 4:30 p.m. daily. Your request will receive top priority, and you can expect your order to be delivered to your desk within 48 hours. If there is a problem with an order, (e.g., out of stock) he/she will inform you immediately and assist you in making an alternate selection.

**Note: Your minimum order must be sixty dollars ($60.00)** and you will receive an additional 3.5%, Point-of-Sale discount in addition to the discounted price of the product ordered. Try to establish a time of day/week to place orders and remind co-workers of our deadline. It will help your co-workers to be more efficient about ordering supplies, and it will save you time and money if you make an effort to consolidate orders.

Our Staples On-Site Representative cannot help you with orders placed through the Staples Direct Mail Order catalog or orders placed through Staples.com. These divisions do not recognize Fordham University as an account and hence will not honor our negotiated pricing.
