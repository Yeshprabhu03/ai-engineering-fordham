The Purchasing Department has been given the responsibility to function as the University’s representative with vendors, to ensure that the User Department’s needs are accommodated with quality goods and services in a prompt, cost-efficient manner and to commit the University to binding contracts within the guidelines of University policy. This responsibility includes the selection of vendors, negotiation of price and assurance of quality and prompt delivery to the University.

Purchasing is also responsible for the development of standards, specifications, materials, and systems in conjunction with the User Departments. It is responsible for advising User Departments on the availability and value of materials and services in the marketplace.

The Purchasing Department is obligated by the University and Internal Audit to maintain a formal procurement system. Its purchasing files are subject to audit by federal and state agencies and must include proper documentation (e.g., purchase orders, contract negotiations, bid awards, sole source justifications, etc.).
