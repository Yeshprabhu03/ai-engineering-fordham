# How is the Purchasing Department Essential to Fordham University?

- The Purchasing Process is essential to the financial wellness of the University.
- The Purchasing Process provides the University Community with vital information about vendors, products, merchandise, and services.
- The Purchasing Process promotes fair bidding and purchasing practices, thus maximizing buying power.
- The Purchasing Process is most effective and efficient when departmental client end-users provide Procurement with the product and/or service specifications or guidelines.
- The Purchasing Process provides the client with choices. Multiple resources provide a safety factor, not present when only one vendor is providing the product or service. A well-informed client is more likely to make the better choice.
