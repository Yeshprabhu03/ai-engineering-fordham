# Purchase Order Changes

All Purchase Orders can be changed to add information, items, or modify dollar total amount. A requisition addendum, an email, or memo must be sent by authorized personnel to formally change the information.

-
If there needs to be an addendum to the PO, either due to item, service, or fund change or additions, a requisition is sent to purchasing, with all necessary approvals, referencing the original PO number. The old dollar amount is referenced on the first line, with the new additions thereafter, confirming the new dollar total on the bottom of the requisition:

**Original Order Total**: $5,850**Increase/ Additional funds**: $250**New Adjusted Total**: $6,100The requisition is processed, and a Change Order is then created in Banner. A corrected PO copy is produced and dispersed.

-
If there needs to be any changes to a PO with a task order, either due to item, service, or fund change or additions, a requisition is sent to purchasing with all necessary approvals referencing the original PO number. The old dollar amount is referenced on the first line, with the new additions thereafter, confirming the new dollar total on the bottom of the requisition. In addition, a new Task order which matches the new Requisition description and amount. The requisition is processed, and a Change Order is then created in Banner. A corrected PO copy is produced and dispersed.

-
Once a Purchase Order leaves the Purchasing Department and is received by the vendor, the vendor then has a legal agreement in its hand to start the processing of our request. This is a legal document that if not properly canceled or modified, can have legal repercussions. In most situations, there is no problem with canceling. But the guidelines below will protect both your department and Fordham University.

The following steps must be taken if a department decides to:

- Alter specifications on items already ordered; or
- Cancel an order.

- The Purchasing Department must be contacted immediately so that the vendor can be notified before shipping occurs.

**If the order is canceled by the department – the Purchasing Department must be notified as soon as possible. An email or a memo must be sent for the request to cancel the Purchase Order and to liquidate funds. - The following information is needed to cancel a Purchase Order:
- Who canceled the order?
- Vendor Contact person. The person you spoke with to cancel the Purchase Order.
- Date of cancellation.
- Confirmation/emails of cancellation from the vendor.
- Reason for cancellation.


**Note: Any charges incurred are an obligation of the ordering department.** -
The department must notify the Purchasing Department in writing when a service contract should be terminated because of equipment disposal, obsolescence or any other reason.

Upon receipt of an authorized cancellation order, the Purchasing Department will notify the vendor to cancel the (unused) portion of the service contract and request a credit or refund, if applicable and allowed by the vendor.

**Please Note: Many vendors will automatically renew unless told otherwise.** -
Purchase orders are closed at the end of each fiscal year. New orders may be opened July 1 of each year. Blanket and Service orders may be renewed according to departmental needs.

**Please reference the last year’s PO number on the requisition**with the current new information and agreement or statement. Requisitions for renewals of past purchase orders are processed quickly if all information is available. If no PO is referenced, it may take longer to process, and to confirm its renewal status. Please mark “New” on a new service to identify it. -
All Purchase Orders using operational funds will be closed at the end of the fiscal year.

If items are not received by June 30 of the fiscal year, they must be paid in the new fiscal years by using a check request.

Capital project purchase orders may have the PO and their encumbrances rolled over to the new fiscal year if there are existing funds.
