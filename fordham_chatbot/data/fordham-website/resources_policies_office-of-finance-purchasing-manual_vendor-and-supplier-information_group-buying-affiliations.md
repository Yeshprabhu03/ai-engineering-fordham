# Group Buying Affiliations

Alliances, partnerships, groups or State agreements all aspire to do one thing - utilize the strength of multiple facilities in order to bring economies of scale to the marketplace.

Manufacturers negotiate discounts for groups based on the number of products the group members might buy over the life of the contract. The negotiated discount is typically higher when a group can guarantee that it ’s members will buy a specified minimum volume. The level of compliance provided by its membership helps the group negotiate a better price.

Fordham University actively participates in the use of three large Group Agreements and has access to small local ones as well.

- N.Y. State agreements (OGS)
- Educational and Institutional (E&I) Cooperative agreements
- Federal GSA Government agreements (where applicable)

Please contact the Purchasing Department to see if any of these agreements can assist you in pricing or sourcing an item.
