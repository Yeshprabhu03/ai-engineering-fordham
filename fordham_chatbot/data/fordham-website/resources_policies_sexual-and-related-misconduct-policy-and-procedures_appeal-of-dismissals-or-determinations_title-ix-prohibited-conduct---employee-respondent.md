# Title IX Prohibited Conduct - Employee Respondent

Notice of intent to appeal must be submitted to the Vice President for Human Resources within five (5) business days of: (1) the dismissal of any allegation(s); or (2) a determination regarding responsibility. All appeals will be conducted in a fair, impartial, and equitable manner by decision-makers who are free of any conflict of interest.

A complainant or respondent may file a written appeal of a matter eligible for formal investigation based upon: (1) a procedural irregularity that affected the outcome of the matter; (2) a claim that the sanction is substantially disproportionate to the finding(s); (3) new evidence that was not reasonably available at the time the determination regarding responsibility or dismissal was made, that could affect the outcome of the matter; or (4) the Title IX Coordinator, investigator(s), or decision-maker(s) had a conflict of interest or bias for or against complainants or respondents generally or the individual complainant or respondent that affected the outcome of the matter.

- Appeal of the Dismissal of a Formal Complaint or Any Allegation

The appeal of the dismissal of a Formal Complaint or any allegations is heard by the Vice President for Human Resources or their designee. Within 20 business days of receipt of the notice of intent to appeal, the Vice President for Human Resources or their designee will inform all parties in writing of the final outcome of the appeal. An extension of the time frame to issue the final decision may be granted for good cause as determined by the Vice President for Human Resources or their designee. The complainant and respondent will be notified in writing of both the appeal and the final outcome of the appeal. - Appeal of a Determination Regarding Responsibility

The appeal of a determination regarding responsibility is heard by the Appeal Panel. The Appeal Panel’s makeup will differ based on the constituency of the respondent. If the respondent is an adjunct or full-time non-tenured track faculty member who is also a member of a collective bargaining unit, the Appeal Panel will consist of an administrator selected by the Vice President for Student Affairs, a full-time tenured or tenure-track faculty member selected by the Faculty Senate, and a bargaining unit member of the respondent’s collective bargaining unit selected by the Vice President for Human Resources. The full-time tenured or tenure-track faculty member will serve as Chair of the Appeal Panel.

For all respondents other than those described above, the Appeal Panel will consist of a representative selected by the Vice President for Student Affairs, a representative selected by the Vice President for Human Resources, and a representative of the respondent’s constituency. If the respondent is a faculty member who is not a member of a union, the constituency representative will be selected by the Faculty Senate or their designee. If the respondent is an administrator, the constituency representative will be selected by the Vice President for Administration or their designee. If the respondent is a member of a union, the constituency representative will be selected by the respective unions or their designee. The representative selected by the Vice President for Human Resources will serve as Chair.

If the Chair of the Appeal Panel determines there is a conflict of interest with any panel member, that panel member will be excused and replaced by another panel member to ensure a fair and impartial proceeding. - Appeal Panel Procedures
