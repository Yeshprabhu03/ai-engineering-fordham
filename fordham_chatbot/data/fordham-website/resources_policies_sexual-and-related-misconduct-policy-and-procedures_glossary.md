# Glossary: Sexual and Related Misconduct Policy

The following definitions apply to the terms used in the Sexual and Related Misconduct Policy and Procedures for the Fordham University Community.

**Bystander:** A person who observes misconduct, or impending misconduct, conflict, potential violence, or conduct that is in violation of rules or policies of an institution.

**Clery Reporting:** The data collected by the Department of Public Safety on violent crimes (including sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking) occurring on or near University property and is compiled in the University’s Annual Security Report. Only aggregate data is reported and no personally identifiable information is collected. For more information on Clery Reporting, please review the Annual Security and Fire Safety Report or contact the Department of Public Safety.

**Complainant:** The person initiating the complaint or the person who is reported to have experienced sexual or related misconduct. When the University initiates a Formal Complaint, the University is deemed the complainant and the person who is reported to have experienced sexual or related misconduct is deemed a witness.

**Confidentiality:** References to confidentiality refer to the ability of designated Confidential Resources to refrain from sharing reports of prohibited conduct under the Policy and Procedures without prior permission from the person sharing the incident, except for extreme circumstances such as a health and/or safety emergency or child abuse.

**Formal Complaint:** For the purposes of the Title IX Grievance Policy, “Formal Complaint” means a document – including an electronic submission - filed by a complainant with a signature or other indication that the complainant is the person filing the Formal Complaint, or signed by the Title IX Coordinator, alleging sexual harassment against a respondent about conduct within the University’s education program or activity and requesting initiation of the procedures consistent with the Title IX Grievance Policy to investigate the allegation of sexual harassment.

**Minor:** Anyone less than 17 years of age.

**Privacy:** Privacy may be offered by an individual when such individual is unable to offer confidentiality under the law but shall still not disclose information learned from a reporting individual or bystander to a crime or incident more than necessary to comply with this Policy and Procedures, including informing appropriate institution officials. All non-Confidential Resources must report information and should so inform the individual reporting.

**Reasonable Person:** A reasonable person under similar circumstances and with similar identities to the relevant Fordham community member.

**Respondent:** The person whose conduct is being reviewed to determine whether there was a violation of the Sexual and Related Misconduct Policy and Procedures for the Fordham University Community.

**Third Party:** Any person, other than a University student or employee, who is on campus or participating in a Fordham sponsored program, activity, or event at the time of the reported misconduct. The term also includes visitors, independent contractors, and vendors.
