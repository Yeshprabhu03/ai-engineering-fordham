# Assignment of an Administrative Support Person to Students: Sexual and Related Misconduct Policy

Administrative Support Persons (ASPs) are trained professionals assigned by the Division of Student Affairs to assist and support student-complainants when a report of sexual assault, stalking, dating violence, domestic violence, or sexual exploitation is received. At the discretion of the Vice President for Student Affairs, the Deans of Students, or the Title IX Coordinator, an ASP may be assigned to student-complainants and student-respondents for reports of other types of sexual and related misconduct. An ASP will be assigned to a student-respondent once a Formal Complaint has been initiated and may be assigned when supportive measures are being issued. An ASP will be available to a student-complainant even if the student-complainant decides not to proceed with an investigation and/or the Student Conduct Process.

ASPs are **not** a Confidential Resource, and information shared by a student with an ASP may be provided to University administrators involved in the investigative processes. Fordham administrators who cannot guarantee confidentiality will maintain privacy to the greatest extent possible. The information provided to a non-Confidential Resource will be shared only as necessary for the University to investigate and/or seek a resolution.

The ASP will, using the information contained in the Campus Assault and Relationship Education (CARE) brochure, explain the various options and supportive measures available, including but not limited to:

- The right to have emergency access to a supervisor or investigator in the Department of Public Safety;
- Medical, counseling, and pastoral resources;
- The University’s prohibition against intimidation and retaliation;
- The standard of proof;
- How to report incidents to local law enforcement or a prosecutor, or to seek other types of relief through the legal system; and
- Supportive measures (e.g., changing academic, living, transportation, and work commitments if such changes are warranted under the circumstances and reasonably available).

An ASP may only be provided to student-complainants and student-respondents. However, the Title IX Coordinator, or their designee, will assist employee complainants and employee-respondents by explaining their rights and options and by providing supportive measures as appropriate.
