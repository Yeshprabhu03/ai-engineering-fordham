**Medical Treatment:** Anyone who is sexually assaulted or physically injured is encouraged to seek a medical examination to determine the extent of injuries. It is also important to understand that physical evidence is collected during a sexual assault examination as a way to preserve evidence should the victim want to pursue criminal charges with the police or a local prosecutor at a later time.

**Law Enforcement / Local Prosecutor:** A victim/survivor of any criminal sexual offense has legal recourse outside the University and can commence civil or criminal proceedings against the offending person. Many of the prohibited behaviors of the University’s policies are also violations of New York State criminal laws where a person can be charged criminally with rape, sex abuse, stalking, and other charges.

**Family and Civil Court:** Additionally, Family Court is a civil court option where a person can seek a civil court order of protection in many circumstances. The Title IX Coordinator and/or the Department of Public Safety can assist any victim in the finding of resources, accompanying a person to court, and in initiating a legal proceeding in family court or civil court.

**A person may report an incident to either the police or the University, or to both simultaneously.** A complainant has the right to have the institution’s process run concurrently with a criminal justice investigation. The filing of a complaint of sexual and related misconduct under this Policy and Procedures is independent of any criminal investigation or proceeding. The University will not wait for the conclusion of any criminal investigation or proceedings to commence its own investigation or to take any necessary supportive measures to protect the complainant and the University community.

However, the University may temporarily delay its investigation to enable law enforcement to gather evidence and to engage in a preliminary investigation of sexual misconduct matters that may also violate the state criminal code. There may be times when the Department of Public Safety or another administrator may contact the police regarding the nature of an alleged incident. However, it is always the complainant’s decision as to whether or not to cooperate with any police or University investigation. The Department of Public Safety and other administrators stand ready to assist in reporting incidents to the police or local prosecutors. Department of Public Safety supervisors are former ranking members of law enforcement who have prior experience and training working with victims of all crimes.
