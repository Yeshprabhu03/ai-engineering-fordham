**Public Safety Online Reporting**

(Using Your Fordham Access IT ID)[http://my.fordham.edu/site/web/content/security/incident_report.jsp](http://my.fordham.edu/site/web/content/security/incident_report.jsp)

Individuals who possess a Fordham Access IT ID may use that ID to submit a **Public Safety Online Report**. These reports will not receive an immediate response from the Department of Public Safety or emergency responders. The Public Safety Online Report is **not** a confidential report - the ID associated with the report will be kept on file by the University. However, the University will maintain the reporting individual’s privacy to the greatest extent possible.
