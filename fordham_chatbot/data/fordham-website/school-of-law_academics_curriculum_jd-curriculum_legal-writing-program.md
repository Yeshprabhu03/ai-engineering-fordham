# Legal Writing Program

## Welcome

The Legal Writing Program at Fordham Law School is one of the most extensive in the country, consisting of a First-Year Program, an Advanced Program, and an LLM Program. Approximately 900 students enroll in legal writing classes each academic year.

The Legal Writing courses are taught predominantly by adjunct professors drawn from the highest ranks of legal practitioners, including federal and state judges, assistant United States attorneys and district attorneys, partners in major New York City law firms, and supervising attorneys in legal aid and legal services offices.

In addition to formal classes, the Legal Writing Program also offers workshops and lectures on a variety of legal writing topics. Some workshops, including those on contract drafting and citation form, supplement the first-year JD curriculum. Others, such as workshops on scholarly writing and transactional drafting skills, are oriented toward upper-class and LLM students. The Legal Writing Program also provides a Tutoring Program for students at all levels.
