Except for the online forms (as noted above), forms must be submitted via email to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7c16111310181d09190e3c1a130e18141d1152191809) and [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#caababada5a6a3ab8aaca5b8aea2aba7e4afaebf).

For documents that are submitted by the student but must be signed by the Placement Supervisor, email submissions can be done in one of two ways:

(i) the student may print the form and have it signed then scan the document to a PDF and attach it to an email; or

(ii) the student may attach the unsigned document to an email addressed to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#701a1d1f1c141105150230161f021418111d5e151405) with the Placement Supervisor in cc and the Placement Supervisor can reply to all that he/she approves the form.

In the case of (ii), the email confirmation by the Placement Supervisor will serve as the "signature." All email submissions should say "Externship Form Submission" in the subject line.
