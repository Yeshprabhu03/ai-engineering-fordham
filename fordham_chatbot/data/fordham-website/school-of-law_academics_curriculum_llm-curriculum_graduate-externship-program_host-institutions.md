# Host Institutions

Thank you for your interest in serving as a Host Institution for one or more LL.M. or M.S.L. externs through our Graduate Externship Program. We are pleased to give graduate students the opportunity to engage in for-credit externships with a wide variety of host organizations, including non-profit organizations, corporate legal and compliance departments, government agencies, and law firms. If you wish to post an announcement seeking LL.M. or M.S.L. externs for your office, please email [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d0bcbcbd90bcb1a7feb6bfa2b4b8b1bdfeb5b4a5) with the details of the externship position, and simultaneously submit the Site Approval Application.

Please note that if your organization has been previously approved as a Host Institution for the Graduate Externship Program and has hosted a graduate extern in the past three years, you need not resubmit the Site Approval Application. If you are unsure whether you need to submit a new Site Approval Application, please contact [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7a1616173a161b0d541c15081e121b17541f1e0f).

Our [Guidelines for Host Institutions and Placement Supervisors](/media/home/schools/school-of-law/pdfs/guidelines-host-institutions-placement-supervisors-accessible.pdf) provides a comprehensive overview of the Host Institution’s responsibilities with respect to our LLM and MSL externs. We encourage you to review this document thoroughly to get a sense of what is expected and required of both our Host Institutions and the externs themselves.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#24484849644845530a424b56404c45490a414051).
