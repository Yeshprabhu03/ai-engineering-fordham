# LL.M. in Corporate Compliance

Fordham Law’s LL.M. program in Corporate Compliance—the first of its kind in the country—introduces students to a rapidly emerging field that is often global in scope. This unique program prepares candidates to respond effectively to new and complex regulatory demands. Students will explore the role of in-house counsel, the corporate compliance office, and the elements of compliance, including risk assessment, attorney-client privilege, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, global codes of conduct, crisis management, deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements, and corporate social responsibility. Students will learn the basic regulatory framework, especially in the banking and financial regulatory industries, and will be trained in the skills that are essential for any compliance professional.

-
Each student is required to complete a minimum of 24 credits of approved courses; the maximum number of credits permitted is 30.

Full-time students take 10-15 credits per semester (11-13 recommended); part-time students take 2-9 credits per semester and must complete the program within 24 months of starting. Up to 4 credits may be taken during summer terms.

-
The 24-credit minimum must include 12 credits of Specialization Distribution Courses approved for the Corporate Compliance program.


The 12-credit Specialization Distribution Course requirement must include the following core courses:- Introduction to Corporate Compliance (3 credits)**
- Compliance Risk Assessment (2 or 3 credits)
- Corporations (4 credits)

We also strongly recommend that students take either International Financial Crime or Anti-Money Laundering.

Remaining credits needed to fulfill the 12-credit Specialization Distribution requirement must be chosen from among the selection of Specialization Distribution Courses approved for the Corporate Compliance program (courses designated "CC" on the

[class schedule available on the Registrar's website](https://myweb.lawnet.fordham.edu/sites/classschedules/SitePages/Home.aspx)).**Students who have taken Corporations as part of their U.S. or foreign law study may seek a waiver of this requirement by submitting the online waiver request form. Note that Corporations does NOT count toward the Specialization Distribution Course requirement, but it does count toward the "Content Outline" course requirement, as set forth below.****Global Corporate Compliance must be taken in first semester of study.* -
All LL.M. students are required to complete the following course:

- Quantitative Methods for Graduate Students (required in first semester of study)*

All LL.M. students who do not hold a J.D. from a U.S. law school are additionally required to take the following courses:

- Introduction to the U.S. Legal System and Process (required in first semester of study)**
- Legal Writing and Research for LLM Students (required in first semester of study)**

[Content Outline courses](/school-of-law/academics/curriculum/llm-curriculum/llm-areas-of-study/content-outline-courses/)*** - Fundamental Lawyering Skills for LLM Students****
- 2 credits of experiential coursework****

Students are required to take Introduction to the U.S. Legal System and Process and Legal Writing and Research for LLM Students during their first semester of study in the LLM program.

Note: If a course fulfills both a Specialization Distribution Course requirement and a Content Outline requirement, the course may count toward both requirements. For example, Corporations (4 credits) counts towards the Specialization Distribution Course requirement and also counts toward the Content Outline requirement.

** Students who completed a similar course in their prior studies, or who have significant business, tax, or other experience that provides them with sufficient knowledge of this topic may seek a waiver by submitting the*[Request for Waiver from LL.M./M.S.L. Program Requirements](https://v2.go.lawnet.fordham.edu/sites/internationalprograms/forms/SitePages/Registration Enrollment Forms.aspx)form.

A note regarding course selection for part time students

The LL.M. program strives to ensure that there is a wide range of courses available in the evening in each of our LL.M. areas of specialization, and to ensure that students will be able to meet their program requirements within their desired time frame for completion.

However, it would be impossible to ensure that any specific course will be offered at a time that is convenient to all students. We encourage you to look at the schedules from past semesters, available on the [registrar's website](https://myweb.lawnet.fordham.edu/sites/classschedules/SitePages/Home.aspx), to get a sense of what courses may be offered in the future (noting, of course, that the schedule varies from one semester to the next).

Should you find at any time that you are having trouble meeting your program requirements within your desired time frame, you should contact Anthony Agolia at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bedfdfd9d1d2d7dffed2dfc990d8d1ccdad6dfd390dbdacb) to discuss options.
