# Online LL.M. in Corporate Compliance

Fordham Law’s LLM program in Corporate Compliance—the first of its kind in the country—introduces students to a rapidly emerging field that is often global in scope. This unique program prepares candidates to respond effectively to new and complex regulatory demands. Students will explore the role of in-house counsel, the corporate compliance office, and the elements of compliance, including risk assessment, attorney-client privilege, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, global codes of conduct, crisis management, deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements, and corporate social responsibility. Students will learn the basic regulatory framework, especially in the banking and financial regulatory industries, and will be trained in the skills that are essential for any compliance professional.


Fordham's LLM in Corporate Compliance is offered both [on campus](/school-of-law/academics/curriculum/llm-curriculum/llm-areas-of-study/corporate-compliance-/) and online.
