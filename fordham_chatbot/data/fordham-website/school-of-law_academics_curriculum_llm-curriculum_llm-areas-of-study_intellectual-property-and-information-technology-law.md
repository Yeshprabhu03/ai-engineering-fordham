Students also choose from more advanced and specialized courses in the fields of information technology and intellectual property law.

A note regarding course selection for part time students

The LL.M. program strives to ensure that there is a wide range of courses available in the evening in each of our LL.M. areas of specialization, and to ensure that students will be able to meet their program requirements within their desired time frame for completion.

However, it would be impossible to ensure that any specific course will be offered at a time that is convenient to all students. We encourage you to look at the schedules from past semesters, available on the [registrar's website](https://myweb.lawnet.fordham.edu/sites/classschedules/SitePages/Home.aspx), to get a sense of what courses may be offered in the future (noting, of course, that the schedule varies from one semester to the next).

Should you find at any time that you are having trouble meeting your program requirements within your desired time frame, you should contact Anthony Agolia at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5e3f3f393132373f1e323f297038312c3a363f33703b3a2b) to discuss options.
