# International Law and Justice

The LLM program in International Law and Justice offers students the opportunity to gain an advanced understanding of human rights protection and promotion on international, regional, and domestic levels. The degree is designed primarily for lawyers and students who work or intend to pursue a career in the public sector, including high-level government attorneys, leaders in nongovernmental organizations, and academics. This LLM program was created under the auspices of Fordham Law’s [Leitner Center for International Law and Justice](http://www.leitnercenter.org/), one of the largest and most dynamic human rights programs in the nation. The Center’s [Vivian Leitner Global South LLM Scholars Program](http://www.leitnercenter.org/programs/VLGSLLM/) offers generous scholarships and stipends to enable select graduate students from the developing world to enroll in this program.

-
Each student is required to complete a minimum of 24 credits of approved courses; the maximum number of credits permitted is 30.

Full-time students take 10-15 credits per semester (11-13 recommended); part-time students take 2-9 credits per semester and must complete the program within 24 months of starting. Up to 4 credits may be taken during summer terms.

-
The 24-credit minimum must include 12 credits of Specialization Distribution Courses approved for the International Law and Justice program.

The 12-credit Specialization Distribution Course requirement must include the following Core Course:

- International Law

Remaining credits needed to fulfill the 12-credit Specialization Distribution Course requirement must be chosen from among the wide selection of Specialization Distribution Courses approved for the International Law and Justice program (courses designated 'INLJ' on the

[class schedule on the registrar's website](https://myweb.lawnet.fordham.edu/sites/classschedules/SitePages/Home.aspx)). -
All LL.M. students are required to complete the following course:

- Quantitative Methods for Graduate Students (required in first semester of study)*

All LL.M. students who do not hold a J.D. from a U.S. law school are additionally required to take the following courses:

- Legal Writing and Research for LLM Students (required in first semester of study)**

Students are required to take Introduction to the U.S. Legal System and Process and Legal Writing and Research for LLM Students during their first semester of study in the LLM program.

Note: If a course fulfills both a Specialization Distribution Course requirement and a Content Outline requirement, the course may count toward both requirements. For example, Family Law counts towards the Specialization Distribution Course requirement and also counts toward the Content Outline requirement.

## A Note Regarding Course Selection for Part Time Students

The LL.M. program strives to ensure that there is a wide range of courses available in the evening in each of our LLM areas of specialization, and to ensure that students will be able to meet their program requirements within their desired time frame for completion. However, it would be impossible to ensure that any specific course will be offered at a time that is convenient to all students. We encourage you to look at the schedules from past semesters, available on the
[registrar's website](/school-of-law/academics/registrars-office/registration-information/class-schedules/), to get a sense of what courses may be offered in the future (noting, of course, that the schedule varies from one semester to the next). Should you find at any time that you are having trouble meeting your program requirements within your desired time frame, you should contact Anthony Agolia at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#204141474f4c4941604c41570e464f524448414d0e454455) to discuss options.
