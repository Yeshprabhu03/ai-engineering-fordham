# Fordham Law International Programs

Fordham Law understands and addresses the challenges presented by globalization to lawyers and their clients. In recognition of the substantial and growing importance of international, foreign, and comparative law to all lawyers, Fordham offers its students a range of opportunities that will enable them to compete effectively in the global legal marketplace—both at our Lincoln Center campus and around the world.
