The primary purpose of the Visiting Foreign Scholar and Visiting Research Fellow Program is to provide an academic community for our visitors to pursue their independent research. Visitors occasionally request permission to audit a class at the Law School. This is permitted to the extent consistent with the visitor’s research goals, space permitting, and with the permission of the professor.

**Beginning January 2024, only visitors who are in residence before the end of the semester's add/drop period (usually the last week of January for the spring semester, and the last week of August for the fall semester) will be eligible to request to audit a course. There are no exceptions to this rule.**Courses available to be audited and the process for requesting audits will be communicated by the Office of International and Non-J.D. Programs to eligible visitors before the beginning of each semester.*Visitors should never contact professors directly.*
