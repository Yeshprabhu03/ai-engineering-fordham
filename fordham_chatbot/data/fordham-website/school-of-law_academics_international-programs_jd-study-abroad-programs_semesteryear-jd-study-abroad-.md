# Semester/Year J.D. Study Abroad

Fordham Law provides a range of opportunities for students to spend a semester or a year abroad. Most students study abroad during the fall semester of their final year of law school. Study abroad in a student’s final semester is not permitted (other than as part of a double degree program).

**Note: Students interested in applying to study abroad for the entirety of their 3L year to earn a double degree must apply in the fall of their 2L year.**

-
Fordham offers five double-degree programs that permit select students to spend their third year at the host institution. Upon successful completion of the study abroad year, students will receive the JD from Fordham Law and a master-level degree from the host institution.

**Please note that travel abroad to countries for which the State Department has issued a Level-3 or Level-4 Travel Advisory are subject to oversight by and approval from Fordham’s International Travel Risk Assessment Committee (ITRAC).***1.

For the student with an international focus, Fordham Law School offers global study opportunities. Fordham students who have completed one year of JD study may earn credit toward the JD degree through study in an approved program at a foreign law school. Students may choose to study abroad for a semester.

In order to complete the application process, please have the following information ready to upload in either PDF or MS Word formats:

- Resume or curriculum vitae.
- Statement of interest, explaining
- Why you are interested in study abroad generally, and in the specific program for which you are applying.
- Your academic and professional objectives in studying abroad and what you hope to achieve through the international study.
- Relevant experiences and/or courses of study that reflect an interest in this particular study abroad.

- An unofficial transcript of your Fordham Law School studies.
- Statement and/or proof of language proficiency, if required.

In addition, you will need to provide the names of two Fordham School of Law Professors who can be consulted as to your interest in and qualifications for study abroad, at least one of whom is a member of the full-time faculty.

Please direct any inquiries about study abroad programs to the Office of International and Non-JD Programs. Do not contact our partner schools directly.

Students should consult Fordham Law School's academic and other calendars to be aware of important dates, including programs hosted by the Office of Career Services.

[Apply to study abroad in the Fall.](https://fordham.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cNo8poTPgiPKWxf) -
Students will pay Fordham Law tuition and applicable fees during their Fordham-sponsored study abroad program. There are no additional Fordham Law fees for participating in a program. In some cases, the host institution will impose limited administrative fees. Students participating in an independent study program will have to consult the responsible school regarding costs.

In the case where a student withdraws from a Fordham-sponsored program, their tuition will continue to apply to their semester on-campus. Any incidental costs incurred by the student (i.e., plane tickets or living expenses) cannot be refunded. Students should also note that withdrawing from a study abroad program after the Fordham Law add/drop period ends could make them ineligible to take courses at Fordham Law that semester. If a student withdraws from an independent study program, he or she will have to consult the responsible school regarding the refund and cancellation policy.

In the highly unlikely event that the entire Fordham-sponsored program has to be canceled, students selected for the program will be informed immediately be telephone and by mail, email, or in person. In addition, individual meetings will be arranged with any student who wishes one. If in the even more unlikely event that the Program is canceled after students have arrived, Fordham Law's Office of International and Non-J.D. Programs will contact all participating students by telephone, if possible, or by email.
