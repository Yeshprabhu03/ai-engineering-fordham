# Summer J.D. Study Abroad

At Fordham Law, our study abroad programs for J.D. students aim to help students develop global fluency—sensitivity to different legal cultures and contexts, linguistic ability, and the flexibility to work effectively across jurisdictions.

Students may earn credit for study at one of Fordham's summer programs in Ireland, Ghana or Korea, or at another summer study program approved by the American Bar Association. Courses in all of these programs are in English. Summer study may not be used to accelerate a student's graduation.

Students should consider whether a summer abroad program might conflict with Early Interview Week. Contact the Career Planning Center for more information.
