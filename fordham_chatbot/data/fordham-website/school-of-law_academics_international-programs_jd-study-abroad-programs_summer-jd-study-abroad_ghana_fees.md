# Fordham-Ghana Program Fees

Students register for one 3-credit course. The course tuition is $4,305. Students are also required to submit a $100 Application Fee.

In addition, students are responsible for the cost of their airfare to and from Accra; housing; health insurance; immunizations and malaria medication; meals and all other living expenses for the duration of the program. We estimate the total of these additional expenses to be in the range of $3,500 - $5,000, bringing the full cost of attendance to $8,000 - $9,500.

**All payments should be made in USD. Program fees are non-refundable in the event that a student withdraws from the program; however, all fees will be refunded to students who are not admitted into the program, or in the unlikely event that the program is canceled.**

## Optional Fees

Course Housing Fees

Accommodations for a standard double room is $150 per person per night inclusive of breakfast.



## Late Fees

Full tuition and all optional fee payments are due by May 1, 2026. Those students who submit payment up to one week late (between May 2 and May 8, 2026) will be assessed a $100 late fee; up to two weeks late (between May 9 and May 15, 2026) a $200 late fee, and so on.

## Refunds

Students who withdraw from the program prior to May 1, 2026, will receive a full tuition and fees refund (minus the $100 non-refundable application fee). Students withdrawing between May 2 and May 8, 2026, will be charged an additional $150 withdrawal fee.

## Financial Aid

Financial aid in the form of federal loans is available to U.S. citizens or permanent residents attending eligible law schools. Fordham Law School students should apply for these loans through the Law School Financial Aid Office. Eligible students at other U.S. law schools should apply for loans through their home schools. Applicants who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents should contact organizations in their home countries to inquire about the possibility of financial assistance, and may be eligible to borrow a private loan.

Students intending to rely on financial aid are responsible for submitting the initial application fee of $100 required to complete an application. They are also responsible for making full payment by May 1, 2026, unless a waiver of this requirement is sought and received in writing from the program. Late fees will apply (see below), so we strongly urge students to apply for loans in a timely manner in order to ensure tuition payment by the due date.

## Cancellation Policy

The Ghana Summer Program reserves the right to alter or cancel its programs. Cancellation would occur in the event of under-enrollment by May 1, 2026, or unforeseen international events that could inhibit program operations or seriously affect participants' safety. In the unlikely event that the program is canceled, students will be notified immediately via telephone and email; the refunds of the otherwise non-refundable application fee and all other payments will be requested within 20 days of cancellation; and Fordham will use its best efforts to make alternative arrangements for any enrolled student to attend a similar program, if desired. If the program were to be modified substantially, students affected by the modifications would be entitled to a refund upon request.
