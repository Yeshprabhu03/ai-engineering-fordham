# Travel in Ghana

## Travel and Documentation

Passports and Visas

A passport is required for travel to Ghana, valid for at least six months after your intended departure date. Students are responsible for obtaining their passports. This process takes time, so students are encouraged to plan ahead and secure a passport early. U.S. citizens may find complete information regarding obtaining a passport from the [US Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports.html?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=20764041823&gclid=Cj0KCQiAxonKBhC1ARIsAIHq_lsP5uyvkaX0zb3LHKqash9JK1U_RAnd2xX823N2YYYl5im2SJX7a8waAvKLEALw_wcB).

With few exceptions, students will also need to obtain a visa for entry to Ghana. Students in the program will apply for a tourist visa, and will be provided with detailed instructions and an admission letter from the program to submit their visa application. The visa process can take up to three weeks, so applications should be submitted by late-April, at the latest. Additional information on obtaining a visa may be found on the [website of the Ghana Consulate, New York, NY](https://newyork.mfa.gov.gh/).

Transportation

Transportation costs to and from Ghana are not included. Participants arrange travel on their own. Students are encouraged to review the U.S. Department of State's travel information for Ghana, available on the [State Department's website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Ghana.html).

## Students With Disabilities

Classrooms and housing are accessible to students with physical disabilities. Students who are requesting accommodation will be required to submit appropriate documentation.

## Housing

Off Campus Apartments

- Accommodations for a standard double room is $150 per person per night
- Accommodations for 2-week Course (14 days) – standard double is $2100 per person

## Health Precautions

The University of Ghana Hospital and Achimota Hospital are nearby. Students are strongly encouraged to read the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Traveler's Health guidelines for Ghana,](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/ghana) which provide helpful information on general health precautions to be taken when traveling to Ghana.

## U.S. State Department Travel Warning

In the event of the issuance of a U.S. State Department Travel Warning for Ghana prior to the commencement of the program, all registrants will be notified directly via email and print mail and given an opportunity to withdraw from the program with a full refund of all monies paid. It is also advisable to participate in the [US State Department Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (SMART)](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/travel-advisories/smart-traveler-enrollment-program.html?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22996730097&gclid=Cj0KCQiAxonKBhC1ARIsAIHq_ltIXsyJhm18R1feVQNgYInJ7eJ973nqhre1owFEHugLL_O1X2egADkaArIBEALw_wcB)during). In the event that the Travel Warning compels the cancellation of the Program, the cancellation arrangements indicated above would come into effect.

## Accident and Sickness Insurance

All Fordham Law students are enrolled in the University's Accident Medical Health Insurance program and are advised to collect receipts in the event of an accident for reimbursement later. Students not enrolled in this program and non-Fordham students should consult their individual insurance carriers.

## Medical Insurance

Fordham students who have purchased Fordham insurance are covered by a mandatory accident policy, the University's Accident Medical Health Insurance program, which provides 100% coverage for medical expenses up to $2,500 per accident, with no deductible. In the event of an accident, students enrolled in this program are advised to collect receipts for reimbursement on your return home. In addition, we strongly suggest carrying/obtaining health insurance for the duration of your time abroad. Students should consult their individual insurance carrier to determine whether and what coverage is provided for travelers. If you are not covered, we strongly suggest purchasing additional insurance that covers sickness, accident insurance (if not already covered by Fordham's or similar a home institution policy), and emergency medical evacuation. While it is highly unlikely that a student will become ill in Ghana, all are strongly encouraged to ensure their health and safety with proper preparation and coverage.

## Immunizations

The Ghanaian government requires proof of Yellow Fever Vaccination for entry into the country. Students will be required to present their Yellow Fever Vaccination card when arriving in Ghana. The CDC also recommends that travelers be up-to-date on routine vaccinations such as diphtheria, polio and tetanus, as well as immunization against typhoid, Hepatitis A and B, and Meningococcal (meningitis). Immunizations should be begun as soon as possible, as many must be taken in stages. Students should consult their personal doctor or health-care provider to determine what vaccinations are needed, depending on such factors as their health and immunization history, areas of the country you will be visiting, and planned activities.

## Malaria

Malaria is a dangerous, yet preventable and treatable, disease that is contracted from the bite of an infected mosquito. Students are again encouraged to consult the CDC Traveler's Health guidelines for Ghana for malaria information. Although malaria is a potential problem, there are precautions that can be taken to minimize the risk: first, avoid being bitten; and second, take an anti-malarial drug. Travelers are unlikely to be bitten if they apply mosquito repellant and wear protective clothing, especially at night. Air-conditioning also repels mosquitoes. With proper precautions, the danger of being bitten can be vastly minimized. Students must also take pills to protect themselves from malaria. Malarone, which is quite effective with minimal side effects, is generally preferred, but students should consult their personal doctor or health care provider for the latest information. Some medications will need to be started prior to arrival in Ghana, so students are encouraged to begin their health preparations as early as possible.
