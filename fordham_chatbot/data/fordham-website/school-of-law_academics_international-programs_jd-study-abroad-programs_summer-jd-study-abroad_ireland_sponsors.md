The university was originally established as “Queen’s College Belfast” by Queen Victoria in 1845 as one of the three colleges in Ireland. It became a full university in 1908 with its own charter and statutes, and the Faculty of Law was one of the university’s three original faculties. The school delivers high quality legal education and services to the legal community in Northern Ireland and is committed to being a major center of legal scholarship. The former President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, and former First Minster of Northern Ireland, David Trimble, are among QUB's notable alumni.

[Laurent Pech](https://people.ucd.ie/laurent.pech), Dean of Law

The Faculty of Law was established in 1908 when UCD became a constituent college of the National University of Ireland. It is the largest law school in Ireland and is housed in the stunning Sutherland School of Law, which opened in the fall of 2013. Committed to achieving excellence in both teaching and research, the school is known for providing a rich and vibrant intellectual environment for its student body. UCD alumni have made highly significant contributions to the legal and political life of Ireland. Seven of the nine members of the Irish Supreme Court are UCD graduates, as are all but one of the attorney generals since the founding of the Irish state.
