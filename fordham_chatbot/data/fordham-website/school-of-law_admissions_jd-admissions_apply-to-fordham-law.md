# Apply to Fordham Law

**Submit your LSAC application online. **If you submit a paper application, then the processing time will be longer.

When completing your JD application to Fordham Law, you will be required to pick either the full-time or part-time division. It is not possible to apply to both divisions in the same application cycle.

The application fee is $75.

**Application fee waivers**:

**To apply for a need-based fee waiver, you must**

[fill out the fee waiver application](https://shared.fordham.edu/index.php/s/sfBfZ2SZbSBYjw9). Completed fee waiver applications should be emailed to

[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#82eee3f5e3e6efebf1f1ebedecf1c2eee3f5ace4edf0e6eae3eface7e6f7). LSAC fee waiver recipients automatically receive a fee waiver when you submit your application. You do not need to apply for a need-based fee waiver through our office.
