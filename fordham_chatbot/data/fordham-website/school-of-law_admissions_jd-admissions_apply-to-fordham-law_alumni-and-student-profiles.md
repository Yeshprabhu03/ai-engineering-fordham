## Grissel Seijo, Class of 2006 and Counsel, Employment, Diversity, and Inclusion, U.S. and International, Restaurant Brands International

“Fordham is a very inclusive school. Its motto—’In the Service of Others’—is more than just words; it’s how we conduct our lives—integrating ethics into everything from moot court competitions to our assignments. It was a financial struggle for me to afford law school, but the community came together to help me find a path to attend. The folks at Fordham are ridiculously special.”

## Abdulai Turay, Class of 2022, National Jurist Law Student of the Year

“My parents always placed a high value on education, and I always thought of law school as a way to empower myself and others. After speaking with my mentor, a Fordham Law alum, it became clear to me that Fordham provided the best opportunity for my professional growth. Since attending Fordham, I’ve been able to learn from some of the most amazing professors and peers. These lessons will stick with me throughout the entirety of my legal career.”

## Khadijah Sharif-Drinkard, Class of 1997, Senior Vice President, Business and Legal Affairs, Viacom Media Networks

“As a student, I participated in a litigation skills clinic, where I learned to focus on meeting the needs of my clients and communicating with them in a manner that was direct and sensitive. Fordham Law helped me hone these skills, and my professors provided invaluable guidance and support. Fordham Law is an incredible and robust community of educators and scholars who left an indelible impression on me, and I believe that their investment in me has certainly paid off.”

## Hon. Denny Chin, Class of 1978, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Adjunct Professor, Fordham Law School

“I owe so much to Fordham Law School. Fordham taught me the law and how to think and act like a lawyer. It taught me the importance of decency, honesty, and hard work, and the importance of service to the public. I am a better judge because of what I learned at Fordham.”

## Brad Butwin, Class of 1985, Chair, O’Melveny & Myers

“As you’re entering law school, your vision is that you’re going to get humiliated in class by professors and deal with sharp elbows from students. Fordham Law is just the opposite. The faculty, administration, and students are in it for the right reasons, which is for the students to learn, expand their horizons, give back to society, and take chances.”

## Kim Koopersmith, Class of 1984, Chairperson of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP

“My path to being a lawyer began with a strong legal education—and I can’t help but note the role of women in my education. I should have appreciated how amazing it was in 1981 that two of my four first-year professors were women. I wish I could do law school again… the gift of practicing law is that you’re doing something incredibly interesting all the time.”

## Chieh Huang, Class of 2008, Co-founder and CEO, Boxed.com

“Fordham has a pretty liberal study abroad policy, so my first summer we went to Korea, and I worked at Samsung in a business capacity. I really was exposed to both sides of the table. My training as an attorney helps me know what I don’t know, which is just as important as knowing something myself.”
