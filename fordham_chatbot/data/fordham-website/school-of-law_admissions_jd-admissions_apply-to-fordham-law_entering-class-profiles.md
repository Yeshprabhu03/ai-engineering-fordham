## What matters to us

Fordham Law School's Admissions Committee — composed of full-time faculty members, Assistant Deans, and the Director of Admissions — evaluates each completed application received. For the 2024-2025 admissions cycle, we evaluated 8,808 applications.

In evaluating the academic record, attention is paid to the grade trend over the course of study, course selection, grades in the major, choice of major, school attended, and the time frame within which the degree was earned. Academic work completed at the graduate and professional school level is also carefully considered. While the best available evidence suggests that the LSAT score and GPA should be accorded significant weight in evaluating most applicants, the Admissions Committee believes that securing the most diverse, interesting, and able entering class involves the consideration of qualitative factors—including prior employment, student activities, service to the community, leadership ability, propensity for public service, and communication skills—which also suggest an applicant's potential to make extraordinary contributions to the success of the entering class specifically and to the legal profession.

Applicants who have been educationally, socially, and economically disadvantaged are afforded a particularly careful review, as are applicants who have had to overcome significant obstacles in their lives.

Finally, efforts are made to ensure that the entire selection process is fair, and the Admissions Committee goes to great lengths to ensure that all applicants are accorded equal treatment, respect, and consideration.
