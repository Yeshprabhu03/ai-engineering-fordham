# Apply for J.D. Financial Aid

Incoming and transfer J.D. students are encouraged to review carefully the following financial aid information.

**Fordham's Scholarships**: The Admissions Committee considers every applicant, regardless of citizenship status, for a scholarship. No separate application is necessary to be considered for a scholarship. Those selected for an award will be notified by the Financial Aid Office via email. The awards are guaranteed for three years, (four if in the part-time evening program) as long as the student maintains satisfactory academic progress. These scholarships generally range from $5,000-$45,000 per year. Transfer students will not be considered for a scholarship.

**Fordham's Need-Based Grants**: Incoming and transfer students are eligible to apply for Fordham Law’s need-based grants. Fordham Law awards a limited number of partial tuition grants based on financial need. These annual grants range from $2,000 to $25,000. They are guaranteed renewable for the second year (full-time) and the second and third years (part-time evening). Because these grants are awarded based on need, and many of our students have substantial earnings from employment in the summer before their final year of law school, the grant may be reduced for students earning more than $15,000 during the summer. Our formula for calculating this reduction is: (gross summer income minus $15,000) X 0.6 X 0.5. Funding for Fordham’s grant program is derived from several sources, including annual gifts and endowed scholarship funds made possible by the generosity of Fordham Law alumni and benefactors.

To be considered for a need-based grant, students must complete Fordham’s Financial Aid Application on the password-protected [admitted students' portal](https://my.lawnet.fordham.edu/sites/admittedjdstudentportal/SitePages/Financing-Your-Education.aspx). Students are advised to complete Fordham's Financial Aid Application soon after acceptance to the Law School.

Total combined institutional aid will never exceed $45,000.

**External Scholarships:** Many external organizations offer grants and scholarships to help with the cost of law school. Sources of outside scholarships include bar associations, civic associations, community foundations, employers, fraternal groups, and religious organizations. Check all sources with which you and your family are associated. In addition, there are Veterans Programs, State Programs, and New York City has a Mayor’s Graduate Scholarship Program. Students can also utilize [AcessLex's Scholarship Databank](https://www.accesslex.org/databank#scholarships) to search for external scholarships.

**Federal Student Loans:** Loans through the Department of Education are available to students who meet the [Federal Student Aid eligibility requirements](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements). Eligible students should complete the following steps to secure their federal loans:

Complete the online [Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa) for the upcoming academic year. **Fordham’s Title IV School Code is 002722.** (The FAFSA must be filed every year that you apply for financial aid.)

**The Financial Aid Office reserves the right to request verification of information provided on the FAFSA or any document submitted to Fordham.**

**Private Education Loans: **To apply for a private education loan, you must apply directly with the lender of your choice. Before deciding upon a lender, carefully review the interest rates, fees, deferment availability, repayment options, etc., offered by each lender in order to find the lender that best serves your needs. Remember, if you are planning on a career in public/government service, private loans cannot be included in the Federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. International students without a U.S. cosigner can check with [Prodigy Finance](https://prodigyfinance.com/).
