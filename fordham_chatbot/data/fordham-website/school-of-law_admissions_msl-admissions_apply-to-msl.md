Fordham Law’s M.S.L. program is designed to accommodate your busy personal and professional schedule. The Law School offers fall and spring start dates for the Corporate Compliance program and a fall start date for the Fashion Law program; and we offer full-time and part-time study options.

Anyone who has earned an undergraduate degree from an accredited university in the U.S. or another country may apply. Individuals who have earned a J.D., LL.B., or similar law degree are not eligible for M.S.L. admission. Instead, they should apply for admission to the LL.M. program.

The admissions committee will holistically evaluate qualified M.S.L. applicants. The admissions committee considered the applicant's academic record, professional experience, career aspirations, letters of recommendation, and personal statement. For students who come from countries in which English is not the official language, English-language ability is also an important consideration.

Applicants must submit their application online. Applications will not be considered until all required materials are received and the application fee has been paid.
