# M.S.L. FAQs

Review our answers to F.A.Q.s by topic.

**Who teaches the courses?**

Courses are taught by a mix of Fordham Law's full-time faculty, practitioners, and industry professionals.

**Who may apply to the M.S.L. program?**

The M.S.L. is for non-lawyers or anyone who has earned an undergraduate degree from an accredited university in the U.S. or abroad. Individuals who have earned a J.D., LL.B., or another law degree should apply for admission to the LL.M. program.

**Are there both full-time and part-time programs available?**

Both full-time and part-time program options are available. The full-time program can be completed in one year (two semesters). Students enrolled in the part-time program may complete it in as few three semesters or extend their studies to fit their busy schedules.

**How long does the program take to complete?**

The full-time program can be completed in one year (two semesters). Students enrolled in the part-time program may take up to three years to complete the degree. Extensions are available upon request. There is only one start per year, in the fall, for our in-person program. Our online program has three starts per year (August, January, and May).

**Is the program available online?**

We offer an online [M.S.L. in Compliance](https://onlinelaw.fordham.edu/sr-msl-academics-form/). At this time, we do not offer an online M.S.L. in Fashion Law.

**Could my credits count towards a J.D. degree?**

No. American Bar Association rules prohibit the Law School from counting credits earned in the M.S.L. program toward the J.D. degree.

**Are internships/externships available?**

The Graduate Externship Program encourages M.S.L. students to engage in for-credit externships with a wide variety of host organizations, including non-profit organizations, corporate legal and compliance departments, government organizations, and law firms. Externship placement experiences are intended to enrich students' educational experience in the Law School’s doctrinal courses and promote their professional development by assisting them in integrating legal theory with skills and professional values.

**For Fashion Law M.S.L. students:**

The Fashion Law Institute pioneered the placement of legal interns at fashion brands. Students within our program have served as interns at companies throughout the New York area. Louis Vuitton, Prada, Michael Kors, Ralph Lauren, Gucci, Coach, Cushnie et Ochs, and SoulCycle are just a few of the brands where our students have interned. Students have also worked at leading fashion funders, nonprofits, law firms with fashion practices, and other organizations connected to the industry. A number of these students have been placed through our Fashion Law Practicum drafting course, in which students receive academic credit for internships supervised by our faculty. Students have also secured internships independently with the help of our extensive industry connections. Internships come in all shapes and sizes, and we encourage students to remember that internships have the potential to turn into a job.

**What deadlines should I be mindful of?**

Application Period Opens: September 15 (for the following fall semester)

Application Deadline: June 1

*Note: priority consideration for [Graduate Student Scholarships ](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/financial-aid/pdfs/Scholarships_and_Financial_Aid_v3.pdf) is given to those with applications completed by May 1.

**Rolling Admissions Decisions**

We make admissions decisions as we receive applications. Thus, applicants are encouraged to apply early.

**Late Applications**

We accept applications after the application deadline if space is available. However, applicants considering late submission should be aware of course registration dates, typically in the beginning of June. After the initial registration date, course selection may be restricted as many classes close quickly due to enrollment limits. If you are admitted after the registration date, we will do our best to help you register for the courses that interest you, but cannot guarantee course availability. For exact registration dates, please see the law school [academic calendar](http://law.fordham.edu/calendar).

Please also be advised that if you require a visa to study at Fordham, visa processing times are lengthy and are out of our control. Fordham's Office for International Services requires several weeks to issue I-20 documentation. If you cannot secure a visa before our start date, you will have to defer to another semester.

**May I defer my enrollment?**

After you are admitted to our program, we understand that other commitments arise which may affect the date of your enrollment. If you need to defer to a following semester, please contact our office at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) so that we can address your request for deferment.
