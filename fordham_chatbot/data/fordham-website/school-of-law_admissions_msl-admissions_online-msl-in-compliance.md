Application Requirements

Completed online applications are reviewed comprehensively by our dedicated admissions team and should include the following:

**Statement of Purpose** — A 500-word statement describing your reasons for pursuing a master’s in compliance, your five-year career plan, and the contributions you hope to make to the profession.

**Letters of Recommendation** — Two letters of recommendation, each from someone who knows you well and can provide a candid, personalized evaluation of your career potential.

**Resume** — A current resume or CV including your complete university-level educational experience, complete employment history, and any additional academic or professional activities. Also, make sure to add any inclusions in publications or presentations.

Please note, applicants with a minimum of two years of compliance-related work experience are preferred.

**Transcripts **— Official transcripts for all degree-bearing courses taken (as part of a complete or incomplete degree). If a course is mentioned on your resume, it must be present in your official transcripts.

**Many schools issue transcripts electronically. If this is the case for your former institutions, have your transcripts sent to [email protected]. You may need to manually enter this email address if it does not appear in the pick list. Please do not select the general “Fordham University” option, as your transcripts will not then reach the correct office.**

To mail your transcripts, request that your sealed, official transcripts be sent directly to:

Fordham University

Application Processing Center

1551 Emancipation Hwy, Unit Number 1304

Fredericksburg, VA, 22401

Students who have completed a degree outside the United States are also required to submit official English-language transcripts or a third-party evaluation of their academic credentials. We accept academic credential evaluations accepted from any NACES-recommended service provider. Exceptions are made for institutions in English-speaking Canada, Australia, Ireland, and the United Kingdom.

Please note that to be considered an official transcript, a transcript must be sent directly from your institution(s) or through an electronic transcript vendor retained by that institution. A transcript submitted by an enrolled or prospective student is considered an unofficial document, even if it is in a sealed envelope provided by the issuing university.

**TOEFL Scores** — International applicants must take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or International English Language Testing System (IETLS) exam, unless they hold a degree from an institution in the United States, any Caribbean Island where English is the sole official language, Australia, English-speaking Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, or the United Kingdom.

We look for a minimum score of 100 on the TOEFL IBT or 7 on the IELTS exam. Fordham’s online M.S.L. TOEFL code is C462.

**Application Fee** — The nonrefundable application fee for the M.S.L. in Corporate Compliance degree is $70. To be considered for the program, you must have completed an undergraduate degree from an accredited university. Please note that GRE, GMAT, and LSAT scores are not required to apply.

If you have earned a J.D., LL.B., or any other law degree, you are not eligible for the online M.S.L. program. You should instead [explore Fordham Law’s on-campus LL.M. degree program](/school-of-law/academics/curriculum/llm-curriculum/).

"I've learned so much not just from the class, but from my colleagues. Each of us brought different tools to the table and different knowledge experiences. Not only were we learning from our professors, but also from each other. In the end, the most beneficial thing you'll get out of this is a Fordham Law School degree. That has value. Fordham Law is one of the most established, well-known law schools in the United States." -Jack Kelly, Class of 2020



"This program gave me an academic foundation. You can only fall back on experience so many times in your career — at some point you also need the knowledge to take the next step. While finishing my final semester, I was promoted at work to lead a new team in Walmart e-commerce in Utah. The online M.S.L. really opens the door to gaining that background and showing your employer you’re ready for the next level. My company fully supported me in this educational endeavor, and even though my job was very demanding, they were proud of me for taking this extra step.
