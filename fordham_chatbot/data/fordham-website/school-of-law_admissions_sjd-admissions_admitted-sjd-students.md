Failure to submit this form will result in a hold being placed on your University records, including registration for future semesters.

Students for whom it is not possible or practical to have this form completed by a physician in their home country may use the services of the Fordham University Health Center to get required immunizations for a fee. The Health Center is located in McMahon Hall, Room 203. You should call 212-636-7160 for an appointment.

5. **Submit Student Visa Documentation**

If you are not a U.S. Citizen or Permanent Resident of the United States and need a visa to study at Fordham Law, Contact [Office for International Services (OIS)](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/academic-resources/international-services/). You will need to submit the Application For Certificate of Eligibility (AFCOE) to OIS. OIS will begin working with fall semester incoming students in May. *Fall semester incoming students should submit their documentation to OIS no later than June 1.* OIS response times may be slower as the semester approaches due to a backlog of late student requests. Submitting your AFCOE form late may delay your student visa and could cause you to miss the start of orientation. The AFCOE form is available here for download: [AFCOE](https://my.lawnet.fordham.edu/sites/nonjdstudentresources/SiteAssets/AFCOE-2023-2024.pdf).

Email the following to OIS, [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#07686e746962707473726362697347616875636f666a29626372387472656d6264733a46414448422235376168756a223537666963223537747277776875736e69602235376a667362756e666b74):
