## Justin De Jesús Sucgang

Working Title: *Future-Proofing Philippine Legal Education through Decoloni[ali]zation*

Supervisor: Professor Russell Pearce

Justin De Jesus Sucgang is a stubborn advocate of legal education reform even before he enrolled in law school. Believing that the future of “any nation depends largely on the legal profession, and that the character of law schools determines the character of the profession”, Justin has, individually and as part of a team of researchers, embarked on various multidisciplinary studies on legal education.

While in law school, Justin was appointed by the Philippine President as Commissioner to the Legal Education Board, the national government agency regulating all law schools in the country. There he endeavored to realize his policy proposals and actively engaged the sector and Philippine Congress to pass legislative measures. His proposals were adopted in toto in a House of Representatives of the Philippines bill first filed in the 16th Congress (HB No. 4736, July 2014), and were refiled in the 17th Congress (HB No. 4258, November 2016) and 18th Congress (HB No. 2836, July 2019). His research and proposals called for an electronic reportorial system, nationwide law school admission test, and a shortened core-track law school curriculum. For his public service and academic achievements, he was awarded one of the Ten Outstanding Students of the Philippines in Malacañan Palace.

After his term, Justin joined the Office of the President of the Philippines to learn more about the bureaucracy, especially in implementing reform measures. He served as a policy lawyer under the administration of two Presidents handling various matters such as national security, big-ticket infrastructure projects, economic development, higher education, and social welfare. Starting as Technical Assistant, he rose through the ranks and left, to pursue graduate studies abroad, as Director III.

Justin is currently an Associate Professor of Law (on leave) in De La Salle University (DLSU) Tañada-Diokno School of Law, where he also served as Director for Academic Support. Currently, he teaches in the University of the Philippines College of Law and the Tarlac State University School of Law. He previously taught at the Lyceum University of the Philippines College of Law. His extension activities as full-time law professor is in keeping with his advocacy. He founded the Center for Legal Education Advancement and Reform, a think tank providing action research and policy proposals on legal education and the profession. He also served as member of the Steering Committee of the recently-concluded PHP70-Million Legal Education Advancement Program, the first initiative funded by the Philippine Congress to help introduce meaningful reforms to Philippine legal education.

Justin earned his Bachelor of Arts major in Psychology degree from DLSU, where he graduated magna cum laude. He obtained his Juris Doctor degree from the same university, graduating salutatorian and pioneer recipient of the Senator Ka Pepe Diokno Leadership Award. He received his Master of Laws degree and Graduate Certificate in Innovation and Entrepreneurship from the University of Michigan on a Fulbright Scholarship and DeWitt Fellowship. He was also a Hughes Fellow of the University of Michigan Center for South East Asian Studies. Justin was a Doctoral Fellow at the Fordham University School of Law and currently serves as Research Assistant of Prof. Russell Pearce. While doing his doctoral studies, he received the silver award for the 2023 Peter Drucker Challenge in Vienna, Austria.
