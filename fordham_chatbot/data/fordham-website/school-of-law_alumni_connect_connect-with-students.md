# Connect with Fordham Law Students

** Mentor Minute**As members of the Alumni Community, we value the advice and wisdom that you hold for the current student population. Mentor Minute was created to fill a need which is not being met for students currently: the ability to gain perspective in short conversations with Alumni who have already walked in their shoes.

The 1L Alumni Mentor Program pairs each 1L House with a diverse group of alumni mentors that span different career paths, backgrounds, and experiences. Alumni mentors serve as a resource for students on a variety of topics, including advice about handling 1L year, strategies for interviewing and the job market, and more.

Involvement can be as much or as little as you wish. Most groups send weekly communication to their lists and almost all have alumni events throughout the year.
