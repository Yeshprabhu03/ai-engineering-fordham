Continued engagement by alumni with Fordham helps each of us, as well as current students, continue to grow our careers as well as catch up with classmates and meet new alumni. One of the best ways for you to channel your connection to the law school is through the Compliance Affinity Group, formed five years ago, for the large group of alumni from the JD, LLM and MSL programs with connections to compliance. This group, with the support of the school, has organized speaker panels, networking events and programs to connect you with one another and with existing students, as well as other professionals in compliance.

If you are interested in learning about how you can become more involved with this group, have ideas for event topics, or know of classmates or colleagues working in this field who may not be receiving our messages, we encourage you to reach out to us. We look forward to hearing from you and working together to provide networking events, job opportunities, CLEs and other events that you truly seek!

**Going forward we’ll endeavor to communicate with you mainly via our new**[Fordham Law Alumni in Compliance](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/11900554/)page on LinkedIn.**We would strongly encourage you to open this page in LinkedIn and request to join our group so that you will know about events and matters of interest and invite your network of Fordham alumni in compliance to join as well by sending them an invitation from within the LinkedIn page. Please help us to keep growing and get the word out!** -

Past Chair:[Scott Scuderi '16](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4536262a3131053626302120372c2624356b262a28)The mission of the Entrepreneur Affinity Group is to create a community of Fordham Law alumni who are either entrepreneurs or who wish to work with them, to learn and improve from the vast years of professional experience within the community, and to develop and foster deep personal and professional relationships with community members.

The group broadly defines entrepreneurs as those who are dedicated to personal and professional growth. It is not a group solely related to starting businesses but, instead, also focuses on general productivity hacks, such as mindset training and system building.
