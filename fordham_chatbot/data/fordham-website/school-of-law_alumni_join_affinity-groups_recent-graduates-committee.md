Who We Are** **

**The Recent Graduates Committee (RGC)**** **at Fordham Law serves to engage and support young alumni who have graduated within the last ten years. The RGC aims to enhance the transition from law school to professional practice by addressing the unique challenges faced by recent graduates and promoting involvement in the broader Fordham Law community. Through events, service, and collaborative initiatives, the committee helps alumni build a robust professional life through maintaining meaningful ties to Fordham Law School.

**What We Do**

This committee fosters connections among new graduates, provides networking opportunities, and engages alumni with exciting events and initiatives taking place at the Law School.

Attend Fordham Law Events and Admitted Student Receptions

Fordham Law School hosts numerous social and networking events open to alumni every year. By attending events and receptions, you will serve as an ambassador by connecting with alumni, friends, classmates, and colleagues. The RGC hosts happy hours at local venues, volunteers with Bowery Mission and Winter Wishes, hosts professional development workshops with current students and faculty, and much more.


Reconnect with your Classmates

As an RGC member, we ask you to reach out to your classmates and encourage them to attend events such as the Holiday Reception, Annual Luncheon, Reunion, and volunteer outings. This is also a great opportunity to tell them about the exciting things that are happening at the school.

Support the Recent Graduates Public Interest Fellowship

The RGC funds a fellowship every year to support students who are interested in participating in summer public interest fellowships but would not be able to do so without our financial support.

The summer is an excellent time for students to become immersed in full-time public service work, apply and further develop skills, gain experience and make a real difference.

Your gift today will help us provide critical funding to a current student who is exploring the public interest field and gaining important career experience through unpaid summer work. Any gift of any amount will help us reach our goal.

**Help us raise $10,000+ for the public interest summer fellowship. **
