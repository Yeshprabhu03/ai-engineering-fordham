# Chambers Associate

Chambers Associate is intended for use by law students and law firm associates who wish to research large U.S. law firms. For each of the law firms included, the site discusses the firm’s practice strengths (based on information from Chambers USA), statistics about the firm as reported by the firm itself, and the results of telephone surveys conducted with the firm’s associates. Visitors to the site may search for firms by name, region, state, or practice area. The site also allows users to compare information about up to three firms in a columnar format.

The site is free and requires no login or user account.
