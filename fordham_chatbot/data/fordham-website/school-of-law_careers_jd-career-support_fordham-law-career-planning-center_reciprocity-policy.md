# Reciprocity Policy

The Career Planning Center of Fordham Law School provides reasonable access to resources to students and alumni/ae of other law schools that allow similar access to their services on a reciprocal basis. Services are available only to ABA-accredited law schools which allow Fordham Law School students and/or alumni/ae to use its career service facilities as well, provided, however, that no such services will be provided to students at ABA-accredited law schools who are visiting at other ABA-accredited law schools within 90 miles of New York City.

Online job listing services are available to third-year law students or graduates for a period of six weeks, during which students/alumni will be given temporary access to Fordham Law School’s Job Bank. Access to the Job Bank is only given to designated students/alumni and will be terminated after the six-week period has ended.

Your law school must send a written request by email to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) before any services are provided. Also, due to the high demand for reciprocity with the New York-area schools, counseling services are not available.

Reciprocity is not offered during Fordham's On Campus Interviewing Season, beginning June 1 and ending on November 1.
