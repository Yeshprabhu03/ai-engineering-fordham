[Martindale-Hubbell](http://www.martindale.com/)("Martindale") is an effective tool for researching law firms and attorneys. Advanced searches can be limited by location, law school or university, specific practice areas, and firm size. Foreign-trained attorneys may find Martindale especially useful for finding other attorneys in the U.S. who attended the same foreign university or law school. You may also wish to search the names of other large universities from your home country to try to locate attorneys from your home country who have successfully relocated to the U.S. -
Fordham Law School has purchased access for all students to the entire Vault Library of guides and resources.

The

[NALP Directory of Legal Employers](http://www.nalpdirectory.com/?School=23305)(the "NALP Directory" or "DLE"), published by the Association for Legal Career Professionals, is a very useful tool for researching the hiring practices and employment policies of employers who are members of NALP, including the majority of large law firms, as well as many large government and public interest employers.The NALP Directory sets forth information on member employers throughout the U.S. and Canada, including brief employer descriptions, contact information, salary information, hiring practices, practice areas, and demographics details.

One of the most useful features for LLM students is the ability to sort employers based on those that hire LLM students. On the NALP Directory homepage, from the drop-down menu titled "Organizations that Hire," select either domestic or foreign LLM students, as applicable. You may wish to narrow your search by employer type and geographic location as well. After running the search, a list of employers will appear. You can then select an employer to view its NALP profile.

[USAJOBS](https://www.usajobs.gov/)is the official job site of the U.S. federal government and provides a one-stop source for federal jobs and employment information.*Note: Whether a foreign-trained attorney will be considered for a federal government position in the U.S. depends on several factors and is generally limited to very specific circumstances.
