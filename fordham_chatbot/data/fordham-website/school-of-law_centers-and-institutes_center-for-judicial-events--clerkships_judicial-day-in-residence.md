# Judicial Day in Residence

In 2019, Fordham Law School established the Center for Judicial Events & Clerkships. The Center’s judicial engagement mandate reflects our desire to increase collaborations between the Law School and the judiciary, with a goal of instilling in our students a broader appreciation for the importance of civics and the rule of law.

The Judicial Day in Residence initiative develops a special connection between the Center and a particular court through which our entire law school community can benefit.

As part of the Judicial Day in Residence, judges are invited to

- visit a class and co-teach with the professor;
- enjoy an informal lunch with faculty, students and their judicial colleagues; and
- participate in a town hall discussion with the law school community, followed by a reception in their honor.

In recognition of the ties between the law school and the court, the Center welcomes the judges’ current and former Fordham Law clerks at the reception.
