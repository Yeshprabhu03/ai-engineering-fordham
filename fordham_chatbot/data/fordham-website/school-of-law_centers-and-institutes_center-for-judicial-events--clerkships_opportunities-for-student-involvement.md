# CJEC Opportunities for Student Involvement

Launched in 2019, the CJEC has a dual mandate: judicial engagement and clerkship support. Its creation represents the law school’s increased commitment to strengthening our relationship with the judiciary. The Center is an active intellectual hub for students, alumni, faculty and the community to learn from and engage with the judiciary.

Judicial Engagement

The Center’s judicial engagement mandate is a reflection of our desire to increase collaborations between the Law School and the judiciary with a goal of instilling in our students a broader appreciation for the importance of civics and the rule of law. The CJEC is honored to collaborate with the Commercial Division Advisory Council to host the Institute on Complex Commercial Litigation at the Law School (in November 2023). The Institute welcomes judges from the Appellate Division and Commercial Division for training on issues related to commercial litigation.

Clerkship Support

Equally central to the mission is developing a space to foster community and build engagement among our cohort of alumni clerks, judges and students to promote a clerkship-oriented culture. The CJEC, working with members of the Faculty Clerkship Committee, provides support to JD students and alumni who choose to pursue post-graduate judicial clerkships at the federal and state levels. Our alumni clerk cohort continues to benefit from enhanced post-clerkship career support.

Opportunities for Student Involvement

Fordham Law students can participate in public lectures, roundtable discussions, and clerkship-focused events organized and sponsored by the CJEC. Our Jurist in Residence, Judicial Day in Residence and View from Chambers events invite members of the judiciary to engage directly with students to educate them on substantive areas of the law, co-teach classes and provide insight into types of courts/judges and their role in the judicial system.

The CJEC welcomes inquiries from, and collaboration with, other law school centers and student organizations that are interested in presenting programs on topics relating to the judiciary and/or welcoming judges to the school. On our Clerkship side, beginning with the 2020-2021 academic year, the CJEC created a Peer Clerkship Council composed of 3LD/4LE students who worked closely with the Center to secure their clerkships.
