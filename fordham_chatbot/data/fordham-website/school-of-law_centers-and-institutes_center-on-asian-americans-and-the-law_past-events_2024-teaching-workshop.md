On July 18th, 2024, the Center on Asian Americans and the Law held its third annual teaching workshop, drawing educators—law professors, college professors, and high school teachers—interested in teaching the (legal) history of Asian Americans in the United States.


The workshop began with an overview of the seminar on Asian Americans and the Law, presented by Judge Denny Chin of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and co-director of the Center. Following the overview, the Master Class session was led by Thomas Lee, Leitner Family Professor of International Law at Fordham Law School, and David Law, E. James Kelly, Jr., Class of 1965 Research Professor of Law at the University of Virginia Law School. They highlighted the adaptability of the teaching materials developed by the center's co-directors, Judge Chin and Professor Lee. These materials, which include a syllabus, readings, and slides, have been used by over a dozen law schools that have recently started offering a seminar on the complex legal history of Asian Americans. The session delivered a powerful message of courage and resilience found as Asian Americans sought justice through the legal system.


**As Professor Law remarked during the session, This is the willingness of Asian Americans, particularly Chinese Americans, to litigate early and often.”**


Professor Andrew Hahn shared his teaching tips for the course and his observations from teaching it at Cornell Law School, demonstrating how he uses video clips to foster class discussions.

Professor Stewart Chang from the William S. Boyd School of Law at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, discussed how the seminar could be offered at other law schools, aligning with the American Bar Association's new Standard 303(b), which mandates law schools to educate students on bias, cross-cultural competency, and racism. The conversation also discussed how similar courses could be offered in colleges and high schools.

Amy Chin, assistant professor of American Studies and Asian Studies at Vassar College, shared what drives her students to learn about Asian Americans and their history. “They want to know about Asians in America,” she said, “they want to know about themselves.”


She explained that these courses help students understand that Asian American history expands beyond personal narratives. By teaching these materials, students recognize that the history of Asian Americans encompasses every aspect of human life, such as citizenship, migration, education, and labor. Indeed, she noted, "Being an Asian American is more than a personal identity." Her observations reinforced the importance and contemporary relevance of learning about Asian American history, echoing the mission of the Center on Asian Americans and the Law.


The workshop concluded with a feedback session on the upcoming book, *Asian Americans and the Law*, prepared by the Center’s co-directors. Professors Mary Szto and Chang suggested adding a few additional cases, along with comments from other participants.
