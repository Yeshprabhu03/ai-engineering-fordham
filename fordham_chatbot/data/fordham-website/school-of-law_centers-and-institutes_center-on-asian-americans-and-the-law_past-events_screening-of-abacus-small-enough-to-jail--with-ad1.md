The story of a Chinese immigrant family-owned savings bank that became the only U.S. bank to face criminal charges in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis was the focus of a recent program hosted by the Appellate Division, First Department.

The Manhattan event, held in recognition of Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month, featured a viewing of the compelling, Oscar-nominated documentary, “ABACUS: Small Enough to Jail,” detailing the Sung family’s five-year legal battle to defend their reputation and their bank’s legacy. Ultimately, the Abacus Federal Savings Bank was exonerated of all charges, now operating in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. The aggressive prosecution of Abacus for mortgage fraud, compared to the more lenient treatment of the “big banks,” was criticized by the media.

Appellate Division, First Department Presiding Justice Dianne T. Renwick opened the program, with members of the Sung family joining Fordham University School of Law Professor Thomas Lee for a thought-provoking discussion following the viewing of the film.

Senior U.S. Court of Appeals-Second Circuit Judge Denny Chin was also among the speakers at the well-attended program, coordinated by Professor Lee and Kathy Hirata Chin, chair of Fordham Law School’s Center on Asian Americans and the Law Advisory Council. The Center, along with the Historical Society of the New York Courts, sponsored the program.

The Manhattan event was one of numerous AAPI Heritage Month programs hosted by courts in New York City and around the State in May.
