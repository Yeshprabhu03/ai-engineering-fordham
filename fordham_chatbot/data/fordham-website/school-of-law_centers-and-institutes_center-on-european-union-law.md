# Center on European Union Law


The center is directed by professor [Martin Gelter](/school-of-law/faculty/directory/full-time/martin-gelter/). It was created by the [late Professor Roger Goebel](https://news.law.fordham.edu/blog/2018/04/23/professor-roger-goebel-founder-of-center-on-european-union-law-passes-away/).

The primary objectives of the center are:

- enabling lectures at Fordham and elsewhere on current European Union Law Topics by Court of Justice Judges, officials of the European Commission and Council, members of the European Parliament, and European scholars;
- development of curriculum and teaching materials to be used at Fordham and other law schools in the United States and Europe;
- facilitation of exchange of ideas and information among scholars, government officials, lawyers, business executives and students; for example, exposure of foreign officials and scholars to U.S. legal concepts and exposure of Americans to European Union Law.

The center assists in arrangements for at least five courses each year from the following list:

- European Union Law
- EC Business and Trade Law
- EC Competition Law
- EC Intellectual Property Law
- EC Intellectual Property Licensing
- EC-US Constitutional Law Comparisons
- European Monetary Union and Banking Law
