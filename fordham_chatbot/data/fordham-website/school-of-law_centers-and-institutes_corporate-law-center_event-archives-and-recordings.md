On March 6, 2023, the Corporate Law Center held its annual Albert A. DeStefano Lecture on Corporate, Securities and Financial Law. This year, the Honorable Kathaleen McCormick, Chancellor of the Delaware Court of Chancery, was the guest lecturer. Chancellor McCormick not only delivered a fascinating lecture on current developments in corporate officer oversight, but also spent time with our students throughout the day. She discussed her path to the bench over lunch with students, and later joined Professor Griffith's Advanced Business Seminar to give a presentation on the work of the Chancery Court.

Chancellor McCormick's lecture focused on the decision in In re McDonald's Stockholder Derivative Litigation, No. 2021-0324-JTL, 2023 WL 387292 (Del. Ch. Jan. 26, 2023), which was recently decided by the Delaware Court of Chancery. In re McDonald's extended the fiduciary duties of oversight, which already apply to boards of directors, to corporate officers. Chancellor McCormick discussed the backdrop of oversight obligations generally before moving on to the recent development that In re McDonald's has ushered in. She also explained how demand futility creates a heightened procedural hurdle for plaintiffs seeking to plead a failure of oversight claim.

Chancellor McCormick joined the lectures' attendees at a reception following her remarks. In attendance were DeStefano family members Paul, James, and Katherine DeStefano, as well as Dean Diller, other faculty, students and alumni. We thank Chancellor McCormick for lending her time, energy, and invaluable legal insights to the Fordham community.
