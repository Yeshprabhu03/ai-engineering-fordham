2024 Transatlantic Conference: Global Elections and their Impact on the Deal Market

The Scott Simpson Cross-Border Institute at Fordham Law hosted a spectacular conference on June 4. Robert Posner delivered an inspiring keynote address on global elections and their impact on the deal market. Experts Jerry H. Goldfeder, Rumela Sen, and Siôn Simon discussed the 2024 elections in the U.S., India, and the U.K. in a panel led by Professor Richard Squire. In a year where more than 40% of the world's population will head to the polls in general elections across the globe, the stakes for the democratic process have never been higher.
