# Attorney Emeritus Program Advisory Council

The New York State Attorney Emeritus Program (AEP) Advisory Council is co-chaired by Justice Christine M. Clark of the Appellate Division, Third Department, and Dean Emeritus John D. Feerick, the former dean of Fordham Law School.

The Advisory Council confers with the AEP team and leadership on ways to ensure that volunteers provide high-quality legal services, to make the volunteer experience as satisfying and desirable as possible, and to help guide outreach, recruitment and recognition strategies. The AEP is staffed by court personnel and a team at the Feerick Center.

The Council also serves as a bridge to the bar, the legal services community, and the nonprofit sector.
