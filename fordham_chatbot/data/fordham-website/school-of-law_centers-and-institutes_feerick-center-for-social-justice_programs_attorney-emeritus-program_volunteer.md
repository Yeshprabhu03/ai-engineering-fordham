# Volunteer for the Attorney Emeritus Program

## Are you 55 years of age or over, in good standing, 10 years in practice, and interested in performing pro bono work?

The New York State Unified Court System’s Attorney Emeritus Program (AEP) offers civil pro bono opportunities to attorneys who meet these requirements. AEP attorneys volunteer with approved pro bono legal service organizations to help serve the significant numbers of New Yorkers with low and moderate incomes who have unmet legal needs and cannot afford counsel.

Step 1

Submit an Attorney Emeritus Program volunteer application by following the steps outlined here. Prospective AEP volunteers can apply by submitting an online application form or by calling 212-930-8871.

After submitting an application, Emeritus volunteers are encouraged to directly contact the host organization with which they are interested in volunteering. You may submit a volunteer application at any time, even if you have not yet adopted the Emeritus status on your biennial registration form.

Step 2

Elect “Emeritus” status the next time you submit your biennial registration with the New York State Unified Court System and Office of Court Administration. You can do this on your attorney registration form, which you receive once every two years.

AEP host programs will provide Emeritus volunteers with the training and support appropriate for the volunteer assignment as well as legal malpractice insurance.
