# CLARO

Consumer defense is the most common unmet civil legal need amongst low-income families nationwide. Locally, the need for legal services in consumer defense is dire. In 2022, at the point of answering, consumer-defendants were only represented in 2.6% of consumer credit actions in New York City Civil Court.

The [Civil Legal Advice and Resource Office (CLARO)](http://www.claronyc.org/claronyc/default.html) addresses this need with limited-scope legal advice and services for unrepresented defendants with consumer debt cases in New York City, Westchester, and Buffalo. CLARO Programs operate under the auspices of the New York State Unified Court System’s Office for Justice Initiatives and its Access to Justice Program. In New York City, CLARO Programs operate in all five boroughs.

Volunteer lawyers work side-by-side with volunteer law students and other volunteers. Consumer law experts help train volunteers and are available for onsite consultation during weekly clinics, which take place in the courthouses. The Feerick Center for Social Justice administers the Bronx, Manhattan, and Staten Island CLARO Programs. Help us improve access to justice for low income New Yorkers by volunteering with CLARO.

The Feerick Center’s work in connection with the CLARO Programs is supported, in part, through a grant from the Corporation for National and Community Service and the AmeriCorps VISTA Program.
