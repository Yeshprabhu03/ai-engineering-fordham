# Feerick Center Immigrant Justice Project

The Feerick Center seeks to provide access to justice and to improve policy and practice for vulnerable migrants, including families and unaccompanied immigrant children seeking asylum and other humanitarian protections.

The Center partners with nonprofit, legal services, and public sector organizations, bar associations, and individuals to respond to the legal representation crisis in the U.S. immigration system. Through education and collaboration on pro bono service opportunities, the Center engages with Fordham students, alumni, faculty, staff and others to create and implement long-term innovative solutions critical for lasting change.

The Center is currently working on multiple fronts to pursue justice for immigrants. In New York City and the surrounding region, the Center partners with trusted legal services providers to help bridge the gap in quality immigration legal assistance for recently-arrived migrants. Through a partnership with the New York Legal Assistance Group, the Center co-organizes and provides volunteers for monthly clinics to screen migrants and prepare pro se asylum and Temporary Protected Status applications for “new” New Yorkers.

The Center also partners with the American Friends Service Committee of Newark, NJ to provide pro se services to detained migrants seeking asylum. At the southern border, the Center has partnered with trusted legal services providers and advocacy groups, including Catholic Legal Immigration Network, Inc. (CLINIC), the Catholic shelter network Annunciation House, and Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center to organize service trips to El Paso, Texas, which has been a historical flashpoint for U.S. immigration policy.

Our volunteers provide legal orientation presentations and provide limited-scope legal services to recently arrived migrants in and outside of immigration detention. Volunteers return from service engagements as ambassadors, raising awareness about immigration policy and the crisis of representation for migrants seeking humanitarian protections.

Finally, the Center engages in fact-finding, organizes convenings, and hosts webinars related to immigration policy. These programs shed light on the government’s ever-evolving policies that affect the due process rights of vulnerable migrants, particularly families and unaccompanied children. The Center is honored to work with its longtime partner, Fordham Law School’s Immigration Advocacy Project, on many of these efforts.
