# LEEAP Education Project

## Education Advocacy

Fordham Law School’s Feerick Center for Social Justice released a report,** Public Schools, Public Oversight: Principles and Policy Recommendations During COVID-19 and Beyond**, calling for standardization, centralization, transparency, and an equity-based approach to NYC high school admissions for highly-selective screened programs.

## Assistance Accessing Higher-Quality Secondary Education

The LEEAP Education Project was born out of the recognition that students from families with low incomes attend quality secondary schools at much lower rates than their more affluent peers. This fact likely contributes to lower college attendance rates amongst students with lower incomes. To work against this inequity, LEEAP volunteers assist students and families with New York City’s complex high school admissions process in middle schools and at community-based organizations in underserved neighborhoods.
