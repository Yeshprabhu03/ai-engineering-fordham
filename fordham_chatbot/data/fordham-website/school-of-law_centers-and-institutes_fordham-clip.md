# Fordham CLIP

As the field of information technology continues to grow at breakneck speed, our society increasingly relies on its developments and innovations. Law and policy, however, often trail the technological advances.

In 2005, Fordham Law founded CLIP, the Center on Law and Information Policy, in response to these regulatory challenges. CLIP is now on the cutting edge of scholarship and legal education in the emerging field of information law.

The Center supports and conducts research, organizes workshops and conferences, and hosts and facilitates high-level public discourse on topics such as data privacy and security, peer-to-peer technologies and intellectual property protection of information assets, and the liability of Internet intermediaries.

CLIP’s work is disseminated widely, helping to influence the guiding principles of our knowledge-driven society and find solutions to legal issues posed by information technologies.
