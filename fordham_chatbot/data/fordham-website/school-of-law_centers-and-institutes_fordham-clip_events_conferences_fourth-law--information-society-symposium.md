# Fourth Law & Information Society Symposium

## March 26, 2010

## Hate Versus Democracy on the Internet

From political blogs to the exposure of rights abuses, the Internet advances communication and the free flow of information that is at the heart of democracy. Yet, from Holocaust deniers to terrorist organizers, the Internet also serves as an enabler for extremists promoting hate, violence and the corrosion of democratic values. This conference explored the legal and policy dimensions of the Internet’s dual impact.

-
This panel examined the Internet’s dual impact on democracy and extremism. Panel members explored how social networks, blogs and websites have been used simultaneously to spread democracy and promote hate. They discussed the tensions that arise on the Internet between these competing interests.
