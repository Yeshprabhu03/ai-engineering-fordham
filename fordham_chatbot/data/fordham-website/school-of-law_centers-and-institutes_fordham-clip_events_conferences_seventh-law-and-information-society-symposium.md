As social networking usage steadily increases and a new digital generation enters the workforce, employers are confronted with questions about how employees' personal use of new technology impacts business interests. However, monitoring, screening and regulating employee online behavior raises privacy and social concerns. This conference will examine the tensions and issues that arise in the employment context as a result of new technologies. Panels will explore both how the law should evolve to address the new issues and what the social and privacy implications are for the various options available.

-
This panel will explore how social networking has impacted the hiring process. The panel will consider how employers are using the Internet to screen applicants and what the legal and privacy implications of that screening are. Panel members will examine new state laws that have been enacted to limit pre-employment screening of social networking sites and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of such laws. They will also consider the social impact that pre-employment screening has on individual identity, particularly in light of the permanence of youthful online behavior.
