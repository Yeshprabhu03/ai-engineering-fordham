### About the Symposium

In 2005, Fordham Law School brought together leading academics in the then-emerging field of information law for a two-day symposium entitled Law and the Information Society that helped launch Fordham CLIP. One of the key goals for the conference was to highlight the emergence of the field itself for the academic community. Since then, the private and public sector uses of the Internet have expanded, mobile devices and applications have exploded, location and tracking technologies have become ubiquitous, social media platforms are everywhere, connected devices are mushrooming, and data has emerged as a core commodity in the U.S. economy. The information law field now permeates virtually every facet of daily life. This conference revisited the themes from 2005 to reflect on the past decade, present time and future decade of law and policy for information practices and technologies.

In essence, we asked: What did we correctly predict in 2005? What did we get wrong? What has changed? What remains the same? What did we learn over the last decade that may predict what the information society will look like in 2026? What does the trajectory of technology, law and policy say about our future? Each panel started with a short presentation on the evolution of the area to set the stage. The panels then were an informal, moderated roundtable discussion with a select group of experts followed by a question and answer session from the audience.
