## Intermediaries in the Information Society

This symposium explored the legal issues faced by internet intermediaries and their impact on society.

When do – and when should – intermediaries receive immunity for user content under the Communications Decency Act. Panelists discussed the status of CDA immunity, the standard for when an intermediary can be deemed a content provider after the Roomates.com and Craigslist cases, and whether the CDA immunity should be modified.
