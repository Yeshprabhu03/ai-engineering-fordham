# Northeast Privacy Scholars Workshop

**The Innovation Center for Law and Technology at New York Law School** and **The Center on Law and Information Policy at Fordham University School of Law** host the annual Northeast Privacy Scholars Workshop at Fordham Law School.

The Workshop, generously sponsored by Microsoft, offers privacy scholars from diverse fields the opportunity to receive extensive and detailed constructive commentary on their works in progress. We invite submissions on a variety of privacy-related topics from a wide range of disciplines, including, but not limited to, law, social science, computer science, engineering, communications, and public policy.

The Workshop format is designed to facilitate discussion and commentary on early stage papers, or papers that can benefit from substantial feedback. Therefore, we will give preference to papers that are sufficiently developed to be read and critiqued, but not yet submitted for publication. There will be no presentations at the Workshop; rather, only brief commentary from a lead commentator and feedback from participants. All participants and attendees are asked to read the papers ahead of time and stay for the entire workshop.
