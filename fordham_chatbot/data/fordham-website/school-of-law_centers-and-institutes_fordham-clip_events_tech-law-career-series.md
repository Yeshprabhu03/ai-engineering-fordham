# CLIP Tech Law Career Series

This annual series is a chance for law students to explore various careers available in technology and information law in a casual setting. CLIP brings practitioners to the law school to discuss their practice with a small group of students over lunch or wine and cheese. The format offers a unique opportunity for students to find out about different practices and ask questions in an intimate setting.
