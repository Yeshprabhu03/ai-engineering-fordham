# Survey of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act

In April 2012, CLIP released a comprehensive report on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act: “Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act: A Survey of the Legal Literature and Reform Proposals.” The goal of the study was to identify trends in the legal literature and reform proposals. By setting out a survey and analysis of the legal and policy landscape surrounding Section 230, the study is designed to be a comprehensive, objective resource to assist scholars and policy-makers in their search for materials addressing the purpose and substance of the statutory provision. The CLIP research team for the study was led by Professor Reidenberg and Jamela Debelak, who were assisted by Fordham Dean’s Fellow, Jordan Kovnot ('11), and Fordham Law student, Tiffany Miao ('13). The research team also benefited from the expertise of Research Librarian Todd Melnick. The work on this project was supported by a gift from Google, Inc.
