Fordham historian and Director of the Jewish Studies Program [Magda Teter](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/departments/history/faculty/magda-teter/)'s new book Christian Supremacy explores the links between historic Christian anti-semitism and racism. From early theology to the modern era through meticulous research and engaging narratives, Teter not only sheds light on historical influences but also encourages a journey towards greater awareness, understanding, and healing.
