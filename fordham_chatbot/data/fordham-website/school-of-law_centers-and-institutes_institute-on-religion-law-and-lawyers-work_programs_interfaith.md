Forming Lawyer-Stewards: The Special Role of Religiously Affiliated Law Schools

Explore the essential concept of stewardship, its relevance to the legal profession, and the pivotal role lawyers can play as stewards for our communities and the planet. Our conference adopted a dynamic, dialogue-based approach, convening attendees in small, diverse working groups designed to foster discussions on the intersection of stewardship with critical areas, including environmental protection, criminal justice, and immigration policy.

Throughout the centuries, in Christian writings and homilies, the Pharisees have been called legalistic, money-loving, self-righteous hypocrites. That definition has become a label applied to Jews in general as well as any persons or groups the speaker or writer despised. For Jews, however, the Pharisees are respected teachers of the past who are in some way the predecessors of all forms of modern Judaism.

Who were the Pharisees, really? And why does this question matter today?
