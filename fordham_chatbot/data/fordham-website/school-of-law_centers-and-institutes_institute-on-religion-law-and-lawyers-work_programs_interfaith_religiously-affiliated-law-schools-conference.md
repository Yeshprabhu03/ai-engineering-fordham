# Religiously Affiliated Law Schools Conference

Forming Lawyer-Stewards: The Special Role of Religiously Affiliated Law Schools

Explore the essential concept of stewardship, its relevance to the legal profession, and the pivotal role lawyers can play as stewards for our communities and the planet. Our conference adopted a dynamic, dialogue-based approach, convening attendees in small, diverse working groups designed to foster discussions on the intersection of stewardship with critical areas, including environmental protection, criminal justice, and immigration policy.
