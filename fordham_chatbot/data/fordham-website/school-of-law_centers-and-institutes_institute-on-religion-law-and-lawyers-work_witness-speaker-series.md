# Witness Speaker Series

Rooted in Fordham’s Jesuit tradition of education through encounter, the series brings to campus storytellers who translate complex legal, ethical, and social issues into human terms—inviting students to reflect on the kind of lawyers they want to become.

Each conversation centers lived experience, drawing students into the real-world impact of law on people, communities, and institutions. Through dialogue with practitioners, advocates, and witnesses, students encounter the moral questions that shape responsible, values-driven legal practice.

**In this opening event of the Witness series, Sister Helen Prejean shared the stories and experiences that have shaped her decades-long work accompanying people on death row and challenging capital punishment in the United States. **

**Her testimony invited students to consider how the legal system confronts state violence and human dignity, and how personal witness, moral clarity, and public advocacy can illuminate both the limits and the possibilities of law. **

**Through her reflections—rooted in encounter, truth-telling, and a steadfast commitment to justice—students were encouraged to think about how legal institutions, narrative, and collective memory shape the pursuit of a more humane and accountable criminal legal system.**
