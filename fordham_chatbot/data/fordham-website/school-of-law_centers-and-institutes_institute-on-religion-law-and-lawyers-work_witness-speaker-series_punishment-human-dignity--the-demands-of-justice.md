# Punishment, Human Dignity & the Demands of Justice

![IRLLW Witness Series Image Man clenching bars in prison](/media/home/schools/school-of-law/Punishment.jpg)


Through personal testimony and legal analysis, this theme explores how systems of punishment—from capital cases to everyday incarceration—test our commitments to human dignity, proportionality, and the rule of law. Speakers invite students to reflect on how lived experience, constitutional doctrine, and ethical responsibility intersect in shaping more humane, accountable, and justice-oriented approaches to sentencing, public safety, and the administration of criminal justice.
