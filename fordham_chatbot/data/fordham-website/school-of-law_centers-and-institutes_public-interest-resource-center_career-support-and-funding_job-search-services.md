Receptions provide a chance to talk with these attorneys to learn about various practice areas and settings, types of work and career paths. Career fairs are primarily designed to let you interview with a number of employers from around the country over the course of one or two days; the fairs often also include separate opportunities to meet and talk with attorneys at informational tables, sometimes called "table talk."

These events will be listed on the Law School and PIRC’s Calendars and announced in Weekly Brief, the weekly calendar of events emailed to students by the Office of Student Affairs PIRC-UP!, the weekly listing of public service events emailed to students by PIRC. Look for posters on bulletin boards throughout the law school as well.
