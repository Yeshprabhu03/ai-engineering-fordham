# For Public Interest Employers

We greatly value our partnerships with public interest employers (especially our alumni).

We are here to connect you with our fantastic students and alums, and to collaborate on events and projects. Please share your internship and job postings, volunteer opportunities, events, etc. Email them to us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#25756c776665434a57414d44480b404150).

In the email, if you would like us to post it in our job bank, please affirmatively give us permission to do so. We will then share these widely with our students and alums.

We would love to meet with you to discuss ways to collaborate. Email us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fdadb4afbebd9b928f99959c90d3989988).
