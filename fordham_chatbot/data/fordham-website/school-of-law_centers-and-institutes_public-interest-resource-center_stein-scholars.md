![Stein Scholars logo 240x240](/media/home/schools/school-of-law/stein-scholars-logo-240x240.jpg)


The Stein Scholars Program is a multifaceted, student-driven program designed to prepare students for public interest careers while building a diverse community of social justice advocates at Fordham Law and beyond.

Founded in 1992 by the Stein Center for Law and Ethics and administered by the Public Interest Resource Center (PIRC), this program spans each student's entire law school career and combines academic coursework and student-organized discussions with hands-on experience to encourage students to engage with pressing social justice issues and find pathways to meaningful and rewarding legal careers.

The Stein Scholars Program combines academic coursework and student-organized discussions with experiential learning to foster a community of law students committed to public service and to prepare students for public interest legal careers. The academic component provides participating students with a firm grounding in social justice advocacy and legal ethics, and the experiential component gives students the opportunity to work in public interest law settings through summer externships. These externships are supported by stipends available through the generous support of the Stein family.

The program also matches students with upper-class Stein Scholars, faculty, and alumni as mentors who provide guidance and opportunities to learn more about what it means to practice as a public interest lawyer.

The academic requirements of the program include:

- 1L Stein Summer Externship Seminar

Applications are now closed. Applications for the incoming 1L JD class will reopen in late summer/early fall 2026.

-
The Stein Council is the administrative/governing body of the Stein Program. Scholars elect two (2) representatives from their respective classes to sit on the Stein Council. The Council meets regularly throughout the year and plays a large role in the administration of the Stein Scholars Program, including annual programming and mentorship.


Many Stein Scholars regard the program as one of their most rewarding law school experiences because it provides them with a supportive community of students, faculty, administrators, and alumni committed to public service as well as opportunities to explore different areas of public interest practice.
