**Adanya Jeudy ’28** graduated from Colgate University with honors in peace and conflict studies and educational studies. As a student, her interests focus on how carceral logics inform our everyday lives with specific attention to how they manifest in what we learn and how. Looking to push past the theoretical, post graduation, she worked in the Conviction Integrity Unit at the Queens District Attorney’s Office where she investigated wrongful conviction claims.

Meeting with incarcerated individuals, investigating their claims, and researching their cases imparted a deeper understanding of the criminal justice system’s mechanisms, harms, and complexities. She is excited to continue building on what she’s learned with her peers in the Stein Scholar Program.

**Macken Keefe ’28** is a student of post-conflict peacebuilding. He graduated from Michigan State University in 2023 with a B.A. in political science.

Macken’s interest in racial politics and inclusion led him to Trinity College Dublin, where he earned an MPhil in conflict resolution and reconciliation in 2024.

His dissertation analyzed how the power-sharing regime in Northern Ireland, which is strictly organized around ethnonationalism, has evolved in response to various peacebuilding obstacles since 1998. Connecting with grassroots peacebuilders in Northern Ireland inspired Macken to serve with City Year (AmeriCorps) for one year in Seattle, where he discovered the power of relationships in human rights work. Macken embraces the idea that meeting marginalized communities where they are, as a partner, is the only way that peacebuilding ideals can be sustainably implemented.

As a Stein Scholar, Macken is excited to discover peacebuilding tools that not only draw from theory, but also push it forward. Macken is from Lake Arrowhead, California.

Inspired by these experiences, Emily came to law school to challenge systems that perpetuate inequality. As a Stein Scholar, she hopes to explore her interests in child advocacy, juvenile defense, and education reform.
