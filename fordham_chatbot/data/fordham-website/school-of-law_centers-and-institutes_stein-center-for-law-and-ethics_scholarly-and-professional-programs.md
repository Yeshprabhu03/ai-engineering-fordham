# Scholarly and Professional Stein Programs

The Stein Center for Law and Ethics promotes critical thinking and analysis of legal ethics and the legal profession by hosting and sponsoring colloquia, conferences and CLE programs, encouraging the open exchange of ideas among academics and practitioners and supporting scholarship.

-
The Stein Center hosts an annual colloquium in collaboration with the Fordham Law Review on a theme relating to the legal profession.

The collaboration dates to the late 1990s and has culminated in the publication of hundreds of articles and essays by scholars and practitioners from around the country and abroad. In 1999, the Fordham Law Review received the New York State Bar Association’s Sanford Levy Award in recognition of “outstanding contributions in the field of legal ethics” for its annual publications in collaboration with the Stein Center. In recent years, the annual colloquia have examined access to justice, corporate lawyers, government lawyers, “subversive lawyering,” “lawyers and their institutions,” the “professional socialization of lawyers,” and the judicial regulation of the legal profession, among other themes.

The scholarship from the annual colloquia on the legal profession can be downloaded from the links below.

The Stein Center annually co-sponsors and organizes the

**Criminal Justice Ethics Schmooze**, a forum for junior and experienced faculty members to receive feedback on ideas and papers pertaining to the work of prosecutors and criminal defense lawyers.

Specifically, the Schmooze provides a small number of scholars of various levels of experience who write in the area of criminal procedure and legal ethics a chance to consider and discuss emerging topics and ongoing scholarship on criminal procedure and professional conduct relating to prosecutors, defense lawyers and the institutions in which they work. In addition to collegial interchange, the Schmooze promotes future scholarship and provides some ideas about where such scholarship might take us. Articles incubated in the Criminal Justice Schmooze have been published in law reviews around the country.If you have questions about the Criminal Justice Ethics Schmooze or would like an invitation to present an early-stage writing, please email
