Dear Employer,

Each spring and fall, the CPC organizes an extensive On-Campus Recruiting Program. Even more legal organizations choose to recruit our students through our formal Resume Collect Programs and our online job bank. With a student body of 1,400 and an alumni population of more than 19,000 individuals of diverse talents and backgrounds, employers have universally found that Fordham Law students are uniquely qualified to enhance their organizations.

Whether your organization already recruits at Fordham Law or is simply considering the option, I welcome the opportunity to inform you about some of the outstanding accomplishments that evidence the quality and caliber of our student body.

Fordham students enter law school focused on achievement, and the intensity of their academic preparations and aspirations does not abate. Challenged by a nationally recognized faculty, the Fordham Law student learns to be a lawyer’s lawyer: an excellent writer, researcher, problem solver, and advocate. Over the past decade, the quality of the students at Fordham, while always impressive, has become truly outstanding. Students who succeed at Fordham have succeeded in one of the most selective law schools in the nation, and I believe they will excel at your organization.

I invite you to visit the
