Virtual On-Campus Interviews

Many employers use time-saving virtual on-campus interviews to recruit for their summer and entry-level hiring needs. Each Spring, Summer, and Fall, the CPC organizes an extensive virtual On-Campus Interview Program, attracting a multitude of employers. Our roster of on-campus employers encompasses law firms, accounting firms, corporations, government agencies, and public interest organizations.

The CPC offers formal Resume Collect Programs seven times times a year (January, February, March, April, June, August, and September). Employers receive application materials from interested students and invite selected students to their offices for an interview. There is no fee to participate, and employers may indicate the specific application materials they require (e.g., cover letters, transcripts and/or writing samples).
