# Fordham Law Professionalism Standards for the Job Search

The Career Planning Center (CPC), the Public Interest Resource Center (PIRC) and the Externship Office are committed to the ethical and professional development of each law student. Toward that end, these Professionalism Standards for the Job Search were created to ensure that each student is aware of professionalism expectations of employers and the legal community in connection with their job search. Adherence to these Standards demonstrates ethics and professionalism ultimately reflecting positively upon Fordham Law School and each student individually. In these Standards, the terms “position”, “job” or “employer” include both paid and unpaid positions, internships and externships, and positions during the academic year, during the summer or post-graduation.

It is important that students accept responsibility for their job search as well as their career and professional development. A part of this responsibility is reading and staying informed about new developments, opportunities and events offered by the CPC, PIRC and the Externship Office. For that reason, students are expected to check their Fordham email account regularly and to read carefully all emails from the CPC, PIRC and the Externship Office.

The most effective job search is one in which the student is proactive and engaged. Please review the following Standards carefully.

1. To act ethically and with integrity throughout the job search process. Each student will:

(i) provide accurate and honest information on all resumes and applications provided to the CPC, PIRC or Externship Office or sent directly to potential employers; and contact the CPC to discuss any item on their resume that he/she is unsure is represented honestly and/or accurately;

(ii) attend all interviews obtained through the CPC On-Campus Interview Program or strictly adhere to the stated cancellation policy;

(iii) attend all interviews obtained through other sources including but not limited to the CPC Job Bank, job fairs including the Public Interest Legal Career Fair and the Equal Justice Works Career Fair and/or demonstrate professionalism by canceling with no less than two (2) business days’ notice;

(iv) upon accepting a position:

(a) cease all job search efforts;

(b) if contacted by another employer, inform that employer that he/she has accepted a position; and

(c) inform all employers that he/she has interviewed with, or with whom his/her application is pending, of the acceptance of another position and withdraw their application(s) with those organizations;

(v) demonstrate professionalism by returning the calls of any prospective employer within two (2) business days, even if it is simply to inform them of the acceptance of another position or that they are undecided about their offer of a position.

2. Every student must abide and adhere to Fordham Law’s Recruiting Guidelines, which incorporate the [Fordham Law Guidelines for the Timing of Offers and Decisions](/school-of-law/employers/recruiting-jd-students/recruiting-programs/policies-governing-recruitment-at-fordham-law-school/fordham-law-timing-guidelines/).

Students whose actions in the job search do not adhere to items 1 and 2 above will be required to meet with the Assistant Dean of CPC, the Assistant Dean of PIRC and/or the Faculty Director of the Externship Office to discuss the individual infraction. As a result of this meeting the student may be subject to penalties up to the loss of the right to the services of CPC, PIRC and/or the Externship Office. In addition, a student may be subject to disciplinary proceedings at the Law School pursuant to the Academic Code of Conduct, which may result in a letter being placed in the student's permanent file. Upon graduation this letter will be sent to the Character & Fitness Committee of the bar in the state(s) in which they register to take the exam.
