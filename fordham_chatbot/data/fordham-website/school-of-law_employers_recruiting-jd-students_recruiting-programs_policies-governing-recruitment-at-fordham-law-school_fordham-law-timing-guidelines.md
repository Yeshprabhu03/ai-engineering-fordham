# 2026 Fordham Law Guidelines for the Timing of Offers and Decisions

Fordham Law School has adopted its own *Fordham Law Recruiting Guidelines*, which include the *Fordham Law Guidelines for the Timing of Offers and Decisions* (the “Fordham Timing Guidelines) below and the *Fordham Law School Professionalism Standards*.

The overarching goal of the *Fordham Law Recruiting Guidelines*, including the Timing Guidelines below, is to foster and encourage communication between students and employers over the course of the recruiting process. In addition to following the specific provisions set forth below, students should keep employers informed, in a timely manner, about the status of their consideration of their offers, and employers should keep students informed in a timely manner as to the status of their candidacies.

The time periods set forth below are intended to be minimums, not maximums, and so we encourage employers to grant reasonable requests for extensions of the respective time periods.

**I. Special Provisions Applicable to Recruiting Students During their 1st Year of Law School:**

- Employers should not accept applications from first-year students until October 15 of the student’s first year of law school
