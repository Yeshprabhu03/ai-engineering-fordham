**Fordham Law students and graduates are ready to join your team in a variety of ways:**

- Post-graduate / entry level associates
- Summer law clerks
- Term-time law clerks

Want to assess a candidate’s abilities and fit before bringing them on board as an associate? Have a case or a project that a law student can contribute to? Hire a Fordham law student for the summer.

Some students will work part-time during the school year too. Or bring aboard a recent graduate to your team! Not sure what works best for you?
