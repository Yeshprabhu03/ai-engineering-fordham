# Donate to the Fordham Summer Fellowship Fund

An employer-sponsored fellowship provides grants to students who undertake full-time summer work in unpaid public-sector jobs. In order to qualify, students must obtain their own unpaid public service internships with non-profit organizations or government agencies and then submit an application to Fordham Law School's Public Interest Resource Center, which makes the final selection.

Summer fellowships are marketed across the Fordham Law School community, providing employers with broad exposure to the student population. Sponsorship levels begin at $5,000.
