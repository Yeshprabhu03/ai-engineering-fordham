# Sponsor a Finals Breakfast

Our Office of Student Affairs ("OSA") provides food to our students when they take their final exams. OSA will provide continental breakfast before morning exams, light lunch snacks before afternoon exams, and even an evening snack when there is an evening exam. We are pleased to offer employers the opportunity to sponsor one of those Final Exam meals.


The fee for such a sponsorship is $2,500.00. Sponsoring employers are encouraged to send an organization poster (so that students are aware that the firm is sponsoring that meal), marketing materials for students to take away, and/or a small assortment of giveaways, such as stress balls, highlighters, Post-It notes, etc., to be made available to students at the food location.
