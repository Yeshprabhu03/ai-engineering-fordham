**Gatekeeper Liability**

*Gatekeeper Liability*

* *

*Regulators have recently focused on the actions of gatekeepers – lawyers, compliance officers, auditors, consultants. In this session, Shirley Emehelu, a former federal prosecutor who is currently the Executive Assistant Attorney General in New Jersey, and Aaron Mendelsohn, also a former federal prosecutor and financial regulator who is currently the Director of the New York City Council’s Oversight & Investigations Division, will discuss the critical role of gatekeepers in ensuring compliance with, rather than enabling violations of, U.S. and Global regulations. Through a review of recent enforcement actions and financial regulations, case studies, and “fireside chats” with leading financial regulators, we will learn best practices for legal and compliance leaders.*
