Clinic students gain real legal experience, which gives them an advantage with employers. Employers increasing indicate wanting "practice ready" graduates.

Law clinics help make students practice ready.

- Students represent clients.
- Students appear in court.
- Students draft documents.

Not only do students become practice ready in the clinic but they also lend their burgeoning legal skills to the movement to increase access to justice for communities underserved and oppressed by the legal system. That is why ** Experience Matters**.
