# Entrepreneurial Law

Sharpen your analysis and strengthen your entrepreneurial legal skills in the Entrepreneurial Law Clinic (the "ELC").

In the ELC, you will work on a wide variety of legal matters through your representation of mission-driven enterprises, including early-stage start-ups, social enterprises, and low-income small businesses, along with the nonprofits that support the entrepreneurial community.

As a student attorney in the ELC, you will provide corporate and transactional legal services to your clients, advise through limited-scope consultations, and participate in community outreach work to educate entrepreneurs about common legal issues.

Practicing in the New York Metropolitan area, where the entrepreneurial spirit exists on every street corner, you will work with clients to select and form legal entities, restructure existing businesses to promote growth, draft privacy policies and terms of service, protect clients’ intellectual property rights, and help clients build their workforce, and draft shareholder, operating, vendor, customer, lease and/or employment agreements, while also creating accessible guidance and legal tools in order to leverage your skills for the broader NYC entrepreneurial community.

The work is detail-oriented, demanding, and extremely important for our clients. It will also give you a solid practice foundation as you move toward launching your career as an attorney.

Whether you take this clinic because you want to pursue corporate and transactional practice or you wish to improve your critical thinking and client relationship skills –significant dividends will be yours throughout your legal career.

It will provide important, practical opportunities for law and business students to learn about entrepreneurship—and how the tools of entrepreneurship can advance social justice.
