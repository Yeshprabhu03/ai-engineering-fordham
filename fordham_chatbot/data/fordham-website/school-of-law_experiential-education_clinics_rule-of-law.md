# Rule of Law

## Advocate to strengthen democratic institutions and protect the rule of law


The Rule of Law Clinic advocates for policy reform and defends against threats to the rule of law and democratic norms. The Clinic’s policy reform work focuses on improvements to democratic institutions, with a particular emphasis on federal and state elections and gubernatorial succession in New York.

Additionally, starting in Fall 2025, the Clinic will work with public interest partners to develop and pursue strategies, potentially including supporting litigation, to protect and advance the rule of law. Students work on teams to conduct legal research, write policy documents, and coordinate with outside partners, including lawmakers’ offices.

Lawyers have a critical role in protecting democracy and upholding the rule of law. Even lawyers who do not work full-time in policy advocacy positions make important contributions in this area through their teaching, writings, public service, bar association activities, and other opportunities to make a difference. The Rule of Law Clinic provides an introduction to democracy reform and defense of the rule of law through hands-on, real world experience.
