## New York City Council Externships

Through an externship with the New York City Council, you'll have the opportunity to work directly with the lawyers who serve the City's legislative body. You'll gain valuable experience in government and improve your legal skills, particularly in research and drafting. Working at the Council, you'll not only conduct legal research and draft legal memoranda and legislation but also attend Council meetings and hearings and prepare sections of Committee briefing papers. Most importantly, you'll participate in the legislative and policy decision-making with Council staff.

In the New York City Council Externship Seminar, you'll learn about the City's legislative process, including the roles played by the City Council and the Mayor's Office. You will study the relevant portions of the City Charter and Administrative Code and analyze state and federal preemption doctrines and case law relating to the powers of the Council. Moreover, you will have the opportunity to draft a piece of legislation and raise questions relating to fieldwork conducted on behalf of the Council.

To apply for an externship with the New York City Council, you do not need to secure the placement on your own. Please fill out the online application for the Externship Program, and we will forward it to the New York Council. We will inform you of the status of your application.

## Externships and Compensations

- Externship students are permitted to receive fellowships, grants, and scholarships, as long as the funds are received from a third-party source and not directly from the placement organization.
- Externship students can receive reimbursement for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses related to fieldwork. Reimbursement is permitted for the following expenses:
- During all semesters: local transportation costs (e.g., subway, parking); and
- During the summer only: the cost of transportation to and from the field placement if it is at a distance from NYC (an “out of town” placement) and for housing and food costs only to the extent they are greater than what they would have been at the student’s home location.

- Externship students may not receive other remuneration from a field placement, including wages or salaries.
