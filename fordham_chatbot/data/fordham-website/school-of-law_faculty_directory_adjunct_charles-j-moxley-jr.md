-
Charles J. Moxley, Jr. is an experienced litigator, arbitrator, mediator and law professor.

He has spent over 35 years as a litigator in large and complex commercial, securities, insurance and other cases throughout the United States, while teaching arbitration law and practice and international law, as well as litigation-related subjects, including evidence, civil procedure, New York practice, and professional responsibility.

In recent years, Mr. Moxley’s professional time has largely been devoted to serving as an arbitrator and mediator. He has presided over more than 250 commercial arbitrations, many of them large and complex cases, involving many parties and high stakes, and has served as a mediator in many cases.

Mr. Moxley has been on panels of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) for over 30 years and has served as a trainer of arbitrators for the AAA, the Dispute Resolution (“DR”) Section of the New York State Bar Association (“NYSBA”) and the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. A Fellow of the College of Commercial Arbitrators and of the Chartered Instituted of Arbitrators, Mr. Moxley is Chair of the Committee on Arbitration and ADR of the Commercial and Federal Litigation Section (“ComFed”) of the NYSBA and the past Chair of NYSBA’s DR Section.

Mr. Moxley has been active for many years in the area of nuclear weapons law and has taught the subject at Fordham since shortly after the publication in 200 of his book, NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND INTERNATIONAL LAW IN THE POST COLD WAR WORLD.

The second edition of this book––titled NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND INTERNATIONAL LAW: EXISTENTIAL RISKS OF NUCLEAR WAR AND DETERRENCE THROUGH A LEGAL LENS––will be released in February 2024.

He has also published numerous law review articles on the subject of nuclear weapons and international law, including in the Fordham International Law Journal, and has spoken frequently on the subject, including at the United Nations, the New York City Bar Association, and the International Section of the American Bar Association.

Mr. Moxley was Symposium Chair for the Law School’s 2010 symposium, “Nuclear Weapons & International Law: A Nuclear Nonproliferation Regime for the 21st Century.”
