Marc Edelman is a tenured Professor of Law at the Zicklin School of Business, Baruch College, City University of New York, the Director of Sports Ethics at the Robert Zicklin Center for Corporate Integrity, and the longstanding professor of Law & Professional Sports at Fordham Law School. He has published more than 75 law journal articles, presented research at upwards of 200 academic conferences, and has testified in front of multiple government agencies.

A recent Fulbright U.S. Scholar, Professor Edelman is cited by both courts and the media on topics including how the Sherman Act applies to professional sports leagues, how gaming laws apply to fantasy sports contests, and how both labor laws and antitrust laws apply within the college sports industry.

In July 2019, Professor Edelman testified before the California state legislature in favor of the Fair Pay to Play Act – the act that first enabled college athletes to earn money from licensing the rights to their names, images and likenesses. In December 2023, he was retained as an advisor to the states of New York and Ohio in the antitrust litigation Ohio v. NCAA, which has led to greater freedom of movement for college athletes.
