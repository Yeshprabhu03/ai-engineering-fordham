Theresa Mohan graduated from Fordham Law in 1990. She received her BA in Political Science from the College of the Holy Cross. Upon graduating from Fordham Law, she spent three years as an associate in the Litigation Department at Simpson Thatcher & Bartlett. Thereafter, she joined IBM’s Legal Department where she spent over 20 years. At IBM, she experienced a broad range of practice areas including litigation, global human resources, and transactions; and also managed a team of transactional lawyers. Ultimately, Ms. Mohan left IBM to become the general counsel of a privately held Apollo company known as Novitex. Through a series of corporate combinations, Novitex became Exela, a public company listed on NASDAQ. Most recently, Ms. Mohan worked as the General Counsel and Secretary of REEF Technology. Through the reimaging of the use of parking facilities, REEF has created ghost kitchens, last-block mobility and logistical hubs that serve the needs of cities, businesses, and consumers. While at REEF, Ms. Mohan grew the legal department from 0-40 people.

Ms. Mohan and her husband Peter, whom she met at Fordham Law, have four daughters and two dogs. Ms. Mohan enjoys spending time with family and friends, engaging in various pro bono and philanthropic activities, sailing, tennis, golf and reading.
