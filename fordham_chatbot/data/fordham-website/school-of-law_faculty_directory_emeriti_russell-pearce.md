### Lawyers Rock

A film essay,

*Revitalizing the Lawyer Poet*offers a new vision of the role and responsibilities of lawyers that rejects the dichotomy between altruistic lawyers and self-interested business people. It also challenges lawyers to develop a more compelling understanding of how they can fulfill their duty to the public good through their everyday work and how they can promote access to justice for low and middle income Americans by expanding the role of non-lawyers.### Red State, Blue State

A film essay on ethics and professionalism,

*Red State, Blue State*brings a fresh viewpoint to the ongoing debate about the role of morality in the practice of law. More information.
