Prior to becoming part of the Fordham Law family, Sweeney joined the U.S. Naval Reserve and became a JAG officer in 1957. He served on the legal staff of the Destroyer Force of the Atlantic Fleet at Newport, principally working as counsel to formal investigations of collisions, groundings, fires, and explosions.

Leaving active duty in June 1962, he practiced law part-time at Haight, Gardner, Poor & Havens and later worked as a full-time associate for the firm from 1963 to 1966.

“Joe had an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. He was a leading expert on maritime law specifically, which grew out of his career in the Navy JAG Corps, but he had a deep love for the law overall and legal history and an insatiable curiosity.”
