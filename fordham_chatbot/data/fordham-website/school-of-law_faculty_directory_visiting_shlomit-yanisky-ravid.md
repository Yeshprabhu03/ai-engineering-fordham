Recently, she researched the challenges of advanced technology, focusing on AI and blockchain and its impact on the legal regime.

She was recently identified as "the foremost thinker on AI and copyright" in the American Copyright Society Annual Event by Judge Katherine Forrest. Her article "Equality and Privacy By Design" addresses big data, that AI systems must "swallow", as the major source of biases, including at workplaces, rather than the algorithm, and suggests a new model of AI data transparency (Fordham U.L.J., special edition on AI and big data). Her article "From the Myth of Babel to Google Translate" discusses, among other topics, AI biases and discriminative results.

Currently, she is writing two books, one of them discussing the interconnections between IP and AI. Some of her latest works discuss blockchain platform in regard to intellectual property regime, addressing questions of the advantages and disadvantages regarding the use of blockchain platforms for selling IP assets - is it "the Promised Land" or "the Dark Side of the Moon".
