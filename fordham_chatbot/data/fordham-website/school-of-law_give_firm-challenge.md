## Join the Challenge

The Challenge runs July through June. Winning firms with 100% participation will receive special recognition at the Law School, as well as the firm with the highest giving.

Any gift to Fordham Law from alumni at participating firms made between July 1 and June 30 will be counted in the Firm Challenge. All gifts to the Law School—no matter the size or designation—count toward the Challenge and toward your firm’s participation rate.

FAQs:

**Does giving qualify me for membership in certain recognition societies?**

Yes! Your giving may also qualify you for the Dean’s Society and the Dean's Young Alumni Society. More info on both can be found [here](https://www.fordham.edu/school-of-law/give/deans-society/). Both Societies recognize the school’s most loyal supporters—alumni and friends who make annual gifts at leadership levels.

**Do pledges count for Law Firm Challenge credit?**

Yes! Pledges are a crucial way of affirming your support of Fordham Law and pledges count for Firm Challenge giving.

**What do Firm Captains do?**

Partner and associate Firm Captains serve as ambassadors of the Law School by encouraging giving among fellow alumni at their respective firms, circulating information about exciting developments at the Law School, and keeping their colleagues apprised of the firm’s standing in the Challenge to help inspire 100% participation.

**What is the timing of the Challenge?**

The Firm Challenge runs July through June, ending on the date of Fordham Law’s Annual Luncheon each year.
