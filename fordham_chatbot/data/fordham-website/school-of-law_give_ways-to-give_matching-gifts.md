# Matching Gifts

Many employers offer a matching gift program to eligible employees. If you or your spouse work for a company that matches employees' charitable contributions, your donation to Fordham Law may be doubled or tripled simply by completing a form provided by your employer.

As a donor, you will be credited with the total contribution, including your corporate match.

Visit our matching gift search engine to determine if your employer matches charitable gifts.
