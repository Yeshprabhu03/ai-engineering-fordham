# Welcome to Gift Planning

Making a planned gift is a wonderful way to show your support and appreciation for Fordham University and its mission while accommodating your own personal, financial, estate-planning, and philanthropic goals. With smart planning, you may actually increase the size of your estate and/or reduce the tax burden on your heirs. Just as important, you will know that you have made a meaningful contribution to Fordham.

Whether you are leaving a legacy of generosity to Fordham University and/or Fordham Law School, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with various gift options by exploring [Ways to Give](https://fordham.giftplans.org/ways-to-give) and [What to Give](https://fordham.giftplans.org/what-to-give). Then [compare gift options](https://fordham.giftplans.org/resource-center/compare-gift-options) and/or [calculate](https://fordham.giftplans.org/resource-center/calculation) how these gifts could work for you. And of course, please [contact us](https://fordham.giftplans.org/contact) for assistance or to discuss your personal situation and objectives.
