“Fordham Law is a great place to learn the law. The faculty are top experts, and the students are both practical and intellectually curious, which creates a vibrant classroom environment. We geek out about the finer points of the law, but we don’t lose sight of how it all matters to people’s lives.”

- Sepehr Shahshahani, Associate Professor of Law
