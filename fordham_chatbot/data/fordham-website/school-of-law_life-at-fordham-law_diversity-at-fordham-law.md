# Diversity at Fordham Law

## Diversity at Fordham Law

We are building a diverse, inclusive, and supportive community where students of all backgrounds and identities feel welcomed and encouraged to express their points of view and learn from one another.

Fordham Law was founded to expand opportunity for those traditionally excluded from the legal profession. Principles of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging are central to [our mission as a Jesuit institution](https://www.fordham.edu/about/living-the-mission/diversity-and-inclusion/) and connect us to a long Catholic tradition of advocating for the dignity and worth of every person. Today, we continue that commitment to ensure that all of our students, especially those from underrepresented communities, experience a learning environment that is supportive and free from bias. Our ultimate goal is to foster an inclusive community and atmosphere where people of all backgrounds are welcomed, able to express their views, and thrive.

## Our commitment to diversity and inclusion

Through a range of diversity programs, we are focused on promoting justice and full participation in the life of the Law School by all members of the Fordham Law community.

### Voices from Our Community

Hear the voices of students, alumni, faculty, and staff as they contemplate the opportunities for addressing systemic racism and the serious challenges that remain.
