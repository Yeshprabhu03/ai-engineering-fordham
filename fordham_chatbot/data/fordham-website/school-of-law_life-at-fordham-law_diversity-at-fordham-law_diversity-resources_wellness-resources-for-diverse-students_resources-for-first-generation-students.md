# Resources for First Generation Students

Fordham law is dedicated to welcoming First Generation students and to providing these students with the resources needed to excel in law school but more importantly, to become part of the law school community. Developing community is an extremely important part of the law school experience and affording this to first generation students is a key component of our mission. In conjunction with the Fordham First Generation Students (F1GS) student organization, we offer programming which begins with first year orientation so that students make important connections The goal of F1GS and the administration is to support incoming students who are the first in their families to attend college, to attend law school, and working class students. We pride ourselves on the diversity of the organization and of our first generation community.

The transition and integration into law school is facilitated in a number of ways such as academic support programming, networking and alumni support opportunities, social activities, career advising, and peer mentorship. Some of the areas on which we focus are:

- Financial management and loan debt.
- Mentorship around the first year experience.
- Building community through orientation activities and semester-long events and activities.
- Networking opportunities relating to the job search, job market, career planning workshops, and programming.
- Imposter syndrome programming for first gen students.
- Peer mentorship and advisement.
- Access to professional organizations devoted to fostering diversity in the legal profession.
- Participation in student-alumni first-gen events sponsored in collaboration with or by F1GS.

The First Year First Gen Experience

Fordham Law launched the First Year First Gen Experience in the Fall of 2021. Incoming students, who are first in the family to graduate college, are invited to attend interactive programs and workshops throughout the academic year that address various aspects of adjusting to law school and entering the legal profession.

This innovative program, The First Gen Experience @ Fordham Law, consists of several components to uplift students and provide tools to thrive in law school and beyond. The main components of the experience include:
