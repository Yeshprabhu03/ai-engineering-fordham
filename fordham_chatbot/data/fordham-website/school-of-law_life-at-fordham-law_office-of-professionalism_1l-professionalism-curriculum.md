# 1L Professionalism Curriculum

Recognizing that professional identity formation begins the moment students enter law school, Fordham Law has structured a robust 1L professionalism curriculum designed to support students’ professional growth beginning on day one and ensure that key professionalism lessons reach every student.

**August Orientation and January Day**

Through our August Orientation program, we introduce students to professional competencies in a practical, meaningful way the moment they arrive on campus. Programs include, but are not limited to:

**Professionalism Primer:**Introductory overview of the broad range of professional competencies valued by legal employers and the critical role well-being plays in academic and professional, as well as personal, success**Developing Your Professional Persona:**Interactive workshop designed to help students begin developing their professional identities by contemplating their strengths and values, and practicing key professional skills such as listening, empathy, and supporting others**Understanding Unconscious Bias:**Interactive workshop designed to educate students about implicit bias and help cultivate cultural sensitivity and awareness**Professionalism Panel:**Panel discussion featuring distinguished alumni discussing the core pillars of professionalism, including honesty, respect, civility, and integrity, and how they manifest in practice

The 1L Spring Orientation or “January Day” builds on these lessons by offering additional professionalism programs designed to broaden students’ awareness of self and others, as well as their repertoires of professional skills. Past offerings have included:

**Navigating Challenging Conversations:**Interactive program designed to heal polarization by helping students practice communicating across differences and disagreeing for understanding**Diversity & Inclusion: Best Practices for Cultivating Inclusive Environments:**Interactive workshop designed to strengthen students’ cultural awareness and offer them practical tools and strategies for disrupting unconscious bias and micro-aggressions and becoming inclusive leaders

**Fall House System Curriculum**

The 1L [House System](/school-of-law/life-at-fordham-law/office-of-professionalism/house-system/) programming interweaves key professionalism lessons throughout the yearlong 1L co-curriculum. House sessions provide students with opportunities to learn about and begin honing valuable social, emotional, and cultural competencies, and to practice these skills alongside their housemates, house leaders, house liaisons, and BSA advisors. House professionalism programs include:
