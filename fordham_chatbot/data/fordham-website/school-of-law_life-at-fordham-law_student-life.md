## Student Life at Fordham Law

Fordham Law offers a thriving community where students feel connected, intellectually challenged, and engaged both in and out of the classroom.

## The House System

From the first day you arrive at Fordham Law, you will join one of five “houses” in our House System—an innovative program developed to create a smaller, more intimate community within the Law School. Each house is led by a faculty house leader and supported by upper-year student advisors, alumni mentors, and staff. Together, they are dedicated to helping you adjust to law school and take advantage of the many resources and opportunities that Fordham Law has to offer.

## Student Organizations

Student organizations are a great way to get involved with the Fordham Law community, connect with fellow classmates, network in your areas of interest, and serve the greater community. In addition, our Public Interest Resource Center is home to a wide range of student-run organizations devoted to pro bono and public service projects. Moreover, student diversity organizations foster diversity and inclusion and provide opportunities to develop leadership skills, establish professional and support networks, and build community.
