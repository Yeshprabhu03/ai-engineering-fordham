## School of Law Disability Services

Fordham University School of Law ensures access to qualified students with disabilities in the belief that the legal profession will benefit from the skills and talents of these individuals. The School complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 which prohibits organizations from preventing an otherwise qualified individual with a disability access to or participation in their services, programs and activities.

-
### Definitions

- A person with a disability is:
- any person who has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities;
- has a record of such impairments; or
- is regarded as having such impairment.

- An otherwise qualified person with a disability is: an individual with a disability who meets the academic and technical standards requisite to admission and participation in the School's educational program and activities.

### Procedure

The Law School takes seriously its responsibility to afford students with disabilities equal opportunities and full access to its programs and services in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of the individual to the extent required by law. Fordham recognizes physical and mental disabilities that include mobility, sensory, health, psychological, and learning disabilities.

Fordham Law students seeking accommodations for disabilities must register on the Office of Student Affairs'

[Disability Services portal on Fordham LawNET](https://my.lawnet.fordham.edu/sites/disabilityservices).This portal will not be available for use by students who have not been admitted to the Law School.

All supporting documentation is required to be uploaded on the

[Disability Services portal on Fordham LawNET](https://my.lawnet.fordham.edu/sites/disabilityservices)for review. If you are in the process of gathering documentation, it is fine to start the process. You will have the ability to add documentation at a later time.#### Early disclosure is essential, to allow sufficient time for review, approval, and implementation of accommodations.

To discuss policies and procedures and establish an appropriate accommodation plan, new law students are strongly encouraged to make contact with Mr. Móntez before fall semester classes begin.

J.D. and non-J.D. degree students, seeking accommodations for the first time at Fordham Law School, are required to

[register with and submit complete documentation to the Office of Student Affairs](https://my.lawnet.fordham.edu/sites/disabilityservices),**no later than the end of the third week of classes for the fall or spring semester**. A student's failure to contact the Office of Student Affairs on a timely basis will result in the denial of accommodation requests for that particular semester.**Students should be mindful that they may have to be reevaluated by their evaluators in the event that the documentation is outdated or non-compliant with the school's documentation requirements.**The need and selection for accommodations will be determined on an individual basis, taking into account the nature, extent and severity of the student's disability; the fundamental nature of the academic program or activity; the functional limitations and impact of the student's disability, the student's history of accommodation and academic achievement; and whether the accommodation would impose an undue burden on the Law School.

All accommodations are prospective. No retroactive accommodations are provided. Having received a prior accommodation in an educational or employment setting does not ensure that you will receive the same or any accommodation at the Law School.

Reasonable accommodations that the Law School offers to students with disabilities may include, but are not limited to:

- Additional time for completing exams and papers
- Individual examination rooms
- Enlarged reading materials
- Provision of materials in an electronic format
- Visual assistive technology
- Computer use during class
- Priority classroom seating


All supporting documentation is required to be uploaded on that site for review. If you are in the process of gathering documentation, it is fine to start the process. You will have the ability to add documentation at a later time.

To ensure confidentiality, requests for accommodations and written verifications of a disability are filed in the Office of Student Affairs, separate from the student's general academic records.


### Documentation

To request an accommodation on the basis of a disability or disabilities, students are required to submit:

- Written documentation from a certified practitioner in the field of the disability. The documentation cannot be older than four (4) years for AD/HD or Learning Disabilities from the date of admission to the Law School, or older than six (6) months for all other disabilities), and
- If applicable, written confirmation of prior accommodations in educational or employment settings (e.g. undergraduate, graduate, and LSAT accommodations). Undergraduate or other graduate documentation must include the beginning and ending dates of such accommodations.

Documentation must comply with the Law School's Documentation Guidelines outlined on this page. Exceptions to the age of the documentation will not be entertained.

Because the Law School's documentation guidelines may differ from requirements for receiving accommodations on the LSAT or at other educational institutions, you must review the information on the Disability Services site carefully.

### Documentation Guidelines

[ADHD](https://shared.fordham.edu/index.php/s/Mcozx3SHsqSirey)[Learning Disabilities or Other Cognitive Disorders](https://shared.fordham.edu/index.php/s/3EmSc5JMTMMPGy3)[Physical Disabilities or Chronic Health Conditions](https://shared.fordham.edu/index.php/s/DSqGQXdxaYdWXEQ)[Psychological or Psychiatric Conditions](https://shared.fordham.edu/index.php/s/YtzSi4tKSzJHAWR)[Sensory Disabilities](https://shared.fordham.edu/index.php/s/7ibzrCnK6ScHCWz)

**Important notes:**Students, with a ADHD diagnosis, seeking extended time on exams, must provide a comprehensive neuropsychological or psychoeducational assessment, typically performed by a psychologist. A diagnosis alone will be insufficient to support a request for extended time on exams.

Students, with a psychological or psychiatric condition seeking extended time on exams on the basis of cognitive limitations caused by the impairment or by medication taken for the impairment, must provide a neuropsychological, psychological or psychological assessment battery to document the impact on cognition (see Guidelines on Learning Disability or Other Cognitive Disorders for guidance).

### Applying for Disability-Related Accommodations on the Bar Exam and MPRE

Students who plan on requesting testing accommodations on the Bar Exam should review the website of the state where they are taking the exam and familiarize themselves with the application requirements and deadlines. Information about the

[New York Bar Exam](https://www.nybarexam.org/ada/ada.htm)can be found on its website; individual state Bar Exam requirements can be found on the[American Bar Association](https://www.americanbar.org/)website.Information about requesting accommodations on the

[Multistate Professional Responsibility Exam](https://www.ncbex.org/exams/mpre/ada-accommodations/)(MPRE) can be found on its website.Keep in mind that Fordham Law School's process of providing accommodations is not necessarily reflective of the process for receiving testing accommodations on the Bar exam or MPRE. Each state has its own requirements and due dates to request accommodations.

Students who are updating their documentation for the Law School's accommodations process are strongly encouraged to provide their evaluators with the documentation guidelines for the Bar exam and MPRE.

### Temporary Impairments

While our legal obligation relates to disabilities of a substantial and long-term nature, we also consider accommodations for temporary impairments when practical. For more information,

## Resources for Student Concerns
