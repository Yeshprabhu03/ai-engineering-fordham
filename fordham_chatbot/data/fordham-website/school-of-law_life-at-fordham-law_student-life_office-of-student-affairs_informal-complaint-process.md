# Informal Complaint Process

Students who wish to raise a concern or file an informal complaint of any kind may do so by contacting either the Assistant Dean of Students or the Associate Academic Dean in writing to schedule an appointment. The purpose of this initial meeting is to provide the student with an opportunity to air the concern in a confidential and supportive setting.

Following this initial discussion, the Assistant Dean of Students will consult with the Associate Academic Dean to determine an appropriate course of action to address the concern. This consultation will include a consideration of the student's preferences regarding how the matter should be handled.

The informal complaint process is designed to provide a flexible and responsive means of addressing student concerns. Participation in the informal complaint process does not preclude a student from filing a formal complaint under the [Law School’s Code of Academic Responsibility](https://www.fordham.edu/school-of-law/life-at-fordham-law/student-life/office-of-student-affairs/conduct-and-grievance-policy/code-of-academic-responsibility/), the [University Code of Conduct](https://www.fordham.edu/student-life/deans-of-students-and-student-life/student-handbook/university-regulations/a---z-listing/university-code-of-conduct/), or any other applicable formal grievance procedures.
