# Student Complaints Implicating Compliance With ABA Standards for Legal Education

Students who wish to share any concerns they may have relating to the Law School’s program of legal education and/or the policies and procedures put in place by the Law School to facilitate compliance with the ABA’s Standards for Legal Education, may do so by submitting the complaint in writing to the Assistant Dean of Student Affairs. The Assistant Dean will then work with the appropriate faculty and administrators, as necessary, to address the concern.

The timing of resolution is dependent upon the nature of the concern. The Assistant Dean of Student Affairs shall keep a record of all submissions and their resolutions, as required in ABA Standard 510(b).
