# Student Bar Association

We play many roles: we oversee more than 40 student groups and organizations, provide financial support to all student organizations and ensure that funds are spent properly. We also provide students with an effective means to work with one another and the administration to help ensure that students undertake their legal studies in an optimal setting. To ensure that end, we also sponsors various social activities and educational programs throughout the academic year.
