# Moot Court

## Welcome

Fordham has developed a tradition of accomplished advocacy through the Moot Court Board, consistently fielding championship competition teams year after year. All first year students are introduced to appellate briefs and arguments as part of their Legal Writing Course. Many students follow this initial experience with voluntary participation in the Moot Court Program during their subsequent years at the school. Staff members of the Board are chosen from students who have earned exceptionally high scores for brief writing and oral argument in either of two intramural competitions.
