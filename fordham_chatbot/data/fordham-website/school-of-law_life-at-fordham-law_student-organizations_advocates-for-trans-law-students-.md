# Advocates for Trans* Law Students

## ATLS

ATLS has provided hundreds of New Yorkers with legal name and sex designation change assistance through our community name change program. ATLS engages in local, state, and national trans rights activism and raises awareness about these issues among the campus community. By working closely with administration and faculty, ATLS improves the lives of TNBGNC students at Fordham; for example, through our advocacy, all gendered restrooms now have affirming signs, and faculty training and student orientation include trans-specific training.
