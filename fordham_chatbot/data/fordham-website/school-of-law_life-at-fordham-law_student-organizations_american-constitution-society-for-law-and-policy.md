# American Constitution Society for Law and Policy

The American Constitution Society (ACS) is the nation’s leading progressive law and policy organization, with over 200 student and lawyer chapters in almost every state and on most law school campuses. Originally formed as the progressive response after the Supreme Court’s Bush v. Gore decision, ACS was founded on the principle that the law should be a force to improve the lives of all people.

Through our public programs (over 1,400 debates, conferences, and press briefings across America each year), publications, and active online presence, ACS generates intellectual capital for ready use by progressive allies and shapes debates on key legal and public policy issues including access to courts, voting, equality, immigration, workers’ rights, and many others.

Fordham Law's Chapter of ACS is dedicated to creating space for a deeper discussion of the policy issues affecting our students and communities nationwide.
