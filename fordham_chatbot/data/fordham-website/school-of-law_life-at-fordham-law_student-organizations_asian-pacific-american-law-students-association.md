# Asian Pacific American Law Students Association

## APALSA

APALSA is an organization at Fordham University School of Law that provides events and resources to unite the Fordham Asian Pacific American law student community and bring awareness of Asian Pacific American issues and culture to the greater Fordham community. Ultimately, APALSA is a tool that law students use for professional development, community involvement, advocacy, and legal scholarship. Sponsored events include alumni dinners, mock interview/resume critique programs, exam preparation workshops, peer mentoring, and participation in the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association's Thomas Tang Moot Court Competition.
