# Fordham Follies

The Fordham Follies produce and perform a witty musical celebration of law school life complete with songs, dances, skits, and parodies. It takes place in the middle of the Spring semester, so that we can have a couple of laughs before studying for Spring finals! All students, with or without experience, are invited and welcome to participate! We look forward to seeing you there, it is a show never to be missed. Check out previous performances by visiting our YouTube channel below!
