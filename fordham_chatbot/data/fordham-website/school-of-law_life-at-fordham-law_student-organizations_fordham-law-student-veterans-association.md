# Fordham Law Student Veterans Association

## FLSVA

The Fordham Law Student Veterans Association (FLSVA) is a student-led organization committed to supporting veterans, active-duty service members, reservists, and their families at Fordham Law School. We provide a tailored orientation for incoming veteran students, host private networking events, and maintain direct partnerships with leading BigLaw firms to facilitate recruitment opportunities.

Our mission is to foster community, promote academic and professional success, and advocate for the unique needs of those who have served. We also engage with veteran alumni and support pathways into public service and pro bono work aligned with our members’ values and experiences.
