# Fordham Law Women

## FLW

Fordham Law Women (FLW) serves as an affinity group for women in the Fordham Law School community. For over 50 years, FLW has fostered mentorship, guidance, and community among students. Today, we proudly support more than 500 members as they navigate their legal education and professional development.

Through a range of events and comprehensive programming, including our alumnae panels, wellness initiatives, mentorship programs, and annual End-of-Year Banquet, FLW is committed to promoting our members’ academic and career success. We also seek to raise awareness of the unique challenges women face in the legal profession and in society at large, while cultivating a supportive and inclusive environment for all.
