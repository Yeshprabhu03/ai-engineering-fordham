# Housing Advocacy Project

## HAP

The Housing Advocacy Project brings together students concerned with housing instability and homelessness in New York City and nationwide. HAP works with various community organizations to provide volunteer and research opportunities for students to gain experience and learn about topics such as the civil right to counsel initiative, individual and group legal representation in housing court, and tenant organizing. HAP encourages students to get involved in this work during law school and pursue careers as housing attorneys during this time of soaring rents, increasing homelessness, pervasive gentrification, ongoing racial discrimination, and widespread poverty and inequality.
