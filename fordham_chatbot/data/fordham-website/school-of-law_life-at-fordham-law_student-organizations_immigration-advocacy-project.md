# Immigration Advocacy Project

## IAP

Immigration Advocacy Project (IAP) works towards the goal of ending family detention, and has partnered with the Feerick Center for Social Justice to coordinate and provide legal support to the CARA Pro Bono Family Detention Project, a mass-representation effort aiding refugee women and children detained at the southern U.S. border. IAP seeks to raise awareness of immigrant issues and to train law students to advocate for immigrant rights through remote appellate work. IAP also organizes panel discussions related to ongoing litigation, as well as career paths in immigration law.

The Public Interest Resource Center (PIRC) student groups office is located at Room LL-101 of the Law School.
