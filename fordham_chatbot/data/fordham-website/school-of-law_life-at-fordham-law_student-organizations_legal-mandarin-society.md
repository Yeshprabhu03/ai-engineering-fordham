# Legal Mandarin Society

The mission of the Legal Mandarin Society is to create a dedicated space where students can quickly elevate their Mandarin capabilities and increase awareness of cultural & legal differences between the US & China. The group's aim is to achieve a higher standard of service to future clientele who may require legal counsel in Mandarin. This mission is further fostered by forming a supportive community that celebrates mutual growth and engages one another in conversation throughout the academic year. Collective resource sharing also helps individuals curate individualized plans for Mandarin studies.
