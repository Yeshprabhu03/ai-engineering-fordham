# People's Parity Project

The [People’s Parity Project](https://peoplesparity.org/) is a nationwide network of law students and new attorneys organizing to unrig the legal system and build a justice system that values people over profits.

As law students, we believe we have a responsibility to demystify—and dismantle—the coercive legal tools that have stacked the system against the people. We’re fighting for a justice system that works for working people, especially workers of color, women, and low-wage, precarious, immigrant, disabled, and LGBTQ+ workers.
