# Suspension Representation Project

## SRP

The Suspension Representation Project (SRP) is an advocacy group that trains law students from five New York City law schools to represent public school students in Superintendent's suspension hearings and engages in advocacy regarding issues of school discipline. This project was created in response to the tremendous need to increase access to quality representation for low-income students and parents facing suspension hearings. SRP routinely helps to shorten the length of suspensions, helping kids stay in school.


• Work with NYC Public School Students

• Gain Trial Advocacy and Negotiation Skills

• Connect with the Education Advocacy Community in NYC

SRP pairs new law student advocates with experienced law student advocates to provide excellent training for law students and excellent advocacy for clients. SRP enables law students to develop valuable practical legal skills including interviewing clients, conducting direct and cross examinations, and delivering closing arguments all the while providing students and their families with invaluable support through an often confusing process. Fordham's chapter of SRP also hosts an annual symposium on education law and engages in advocacy on campus related to its mission.
