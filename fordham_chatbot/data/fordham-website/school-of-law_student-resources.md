These offices and organizations are the only ones authorized to post or remove notices and announcements on their respective bulletin boards.

Bulletin boards for general announcements and coming events are designated throughout the Law School building. Notices and announcements to be posted on these boards are to be approved by the Office of Student Affairs. Any notice posted on these bulletin boards without prior approval will be removed. Each office or organization placing dated materials on these bulletin boards will also be responsible for their removal after the announced activity has taken place.

No announcement or notice for an activity hosted by any office or organization may be posted on the walls, doors, floors, elevators, glass panes, lockers, or restrooms in the Law School. In keeping with the University's Alcohol Policy, the Office of Student Affairs will not approve announcements for events involving alcohol.
