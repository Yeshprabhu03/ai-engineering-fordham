# Dean's Message

Interview with Dean Davidson by WAG Magazine.

Whether you are a returning adult student, a temporary visitor, or a newly admitted applicant, I would like to welcome you to our web pages!

Fordham School of Professional and Continuing Studies was created specifically for adult students to complete their bachelor’s degree or to begin their studies at a later point in their lives. Our adult curriculum combines the strengths of Fordham’s core curriculum, which introduces students to the Jesuit intellectual tradition, with Fordham’s breadth of strong undergraduate majors, ranging from philosophy and English, to business and organizational leadership. And of course, our programs are offered in a format suited to your busy lives as parents, employees, and adults, with evening, weekend, and on-line classes.

At each of our three campuses (Lincoln Center, Rose Hill or Westchester) the academic deans will guide you in your course of study. Every semester, you will have an opportunity to discuss your future goals, your past experiences, and your current interests. Together, you will trace out an academic trajectory that begins with core curriculum courses and ends with graduation, while selecting the major best suited to your professional and intellectual ambitions.

At the same time, we recognize the rich backgrounds that you bring to Fordham, by granting up to 75 credits for prior college courses (that meet certain criteria) and up to 30 credits for life experience (through a portfolio submission). In this way, you as a student, with your advisor, can build on past successes (and failures) to make sure that Fordham School of Professional and Continuing Studies becomes your alma mater.

I also urge you to explore courses and majors offered at all three campuses. There you might discover fast-tracks to graduate programs (BASW/MSW in Social Work, MST in Education, MBA or Masters in the Arts & Sciences), enticing minors, or on-line courses you had never considered. At Fordham School of Professional and Continuing Studies we are also developing new courses and programs every year to serve your needs and meet the changing demands of the market place. In short, our rich curriculum engages you to take advantage of the intellectual opportunities available to you throughout the university.

Whichever route you take, at whichever campus you choose, we are there to advise and assist you along your way. Contact us today to discuss your academic plans and how you would like those plans to complement your professional life. We look forward to working with you as you embark on this great journey.
