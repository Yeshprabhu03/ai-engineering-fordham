AHI Seminar Series: Contemporary Topics in the Application of Healthcare Informatics

**Roadmap to a Successful AI Product in the Life Sciences Industry**Thursday, March 7, 2024

8:00 - 9:00 a.m.**Synopsis:**In this talk, I will give an overview of the use cases of data and AI in the life sciences industry broadly as well as the ingredients for delivering successful data/AI products. I will first cover how data and AI are able to deliver a healthier world through two case studies in Real World Data (RWD) and Commercial Life Sciences (CLS). Then I will dive deeper into the designs and technical considerations for building a SaaS platform that enables better results for both the patients and healthcare providers (HCPSs). I will show that while advancement in technology is able to bring life science applications of AI to new heights, its unique challenges require additional considerations when adopting new AI innovations compared to other industries. Finally, I will touch upon how the emergence of GenAI and LLM may offer an easier path forward.**About the speaker:**

**Imelda M. Soledad '25**I attended a workshop in the Fordham MS Applied Health Informatics program focusing on open-source Electronic Health Records.


This extraordinary experience is one I will cherish for years to come. Meeting other AHI Students from various countries, exposed me to diverse perspectives, rich learning and collaborative environment. As I worked on my Capstone Project, I found the workshop invaluable for enhancing my understanding of developing an ontology model for Electronic Health Records.

Since the workshop primarily utilized the open-source cityEHR system, it gave me the chance to explore different methodologies for creating a robust model while learning from my professors, who are experts in this field. The workshop fostered a strong sense of community, with engaging discussions that deepened our understanding of the subject. The supportive atmosphere encouraged inquiries and peer learning, making it an inspiring environment.

Furthermore, the workshop offered opportunities to cultivate new friendships through social events, encouraging meaningful conversations beyond the formal sessions. Despite the intensive schedule, there was an ideal balance between work and relaxation. Looking back, Oxford holds a special place in my heart. The experiences and connections I have made have profoundly influenced both my personal and professional growth, providing me skills and confidence necessary to advance in my academic journey.

**Gabriella Leiber '25**My time during the Spring Oxford Residency has been excellent and impactful. With the different lectures spanning health informatics, I’ve left Oxford more of a well-rounded individual in various aspects of health technology. This Spring Residency was my second time attending the Oxford Residencies, and it has magnified my experience as a Fordham student.

During the week, I was eager to collaborate with my peers in my cohort, previous cohorts, and people in other health and technology organizations. I would recommend anyone on the fence about attending the Oxford Residencies because of the opportunities and experience available by participating in the residency’s seminars. I am incredibly grateful for my admission into the Fordham Applied Health Informatics Program.

As someone who does not have a technical background, I feel accomplished to say I can use the skills in this program to advance my professional career further. Through the flexible times of classes, the Fordham AHI program also allows me to work full-time and attend school full-time, which I was looking for in a program.
