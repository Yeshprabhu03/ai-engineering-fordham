# Master of Science in Hospitality (MSH)

Integrating asset management and real estate investment with a solid foundation of hospitality.

Fordham’s Master of Science in Hospitality is a blend of traditional operations and management training with hospitality investment and development—allowing you to take advantage of understanding real estate to move beyond the management side of hospitality. The program resides within Fordham’s Real Estate Institute and will put you on track for leadership positions in hospitality, from the C-suite and ownership to entrepreneurial ventures.

Fordham also offers advanced certificates in [hotel management](/school-of-professional-and-continuing-studies/academics/real-estate-institute/academics/graduate-programs/master-of-science-in-hospitality-/advanced-certificate-in-hotel-management-/) and [hospitality investment and development](/school-of-professional-and-continuing-studies/academics/real-estate-institute/academics/graduate-programs/master-of-science-in-hospitality-/advanced-certificate-in-hospitality-investment-and-development-/).
