# Fordham Post-Baccalaureate Pre-Med/Pre-Health Academic Policies

Fordham Post-Baccalaureate Pre-Medical/Pre-Health Program students are expected to maintain a yearly cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 in each twelve-consecutive-month period beginning with their initial registration. Students will be considered below the minimum satisfactory academic performance if they earn less than a 2.00 GPA in any given semester. Students must complete at least 50% of their attempted courses in each twelve-consecutive-month period beginning with their initial registration.

Students who do not meet the minimum standards for satisfactory academic performance are placed on academic probation with a notice.
