# Fordham Post-Baccalaureate Pre-Med/Pre-Health Curriculum and Courses

The Fordham Post-baccalaureate Pre-health program provides the prerequisite courses for several aspirant programs. These programs include Medical School (MD, DO), Dental school, Physician Assistant Programs, Veterinary school, Physical Therapy programs, Occupational Therapy programs, accelerated nursing programs, and anaesthesiology assistant programs.

The basic curriculum includes one year of biology, general chemistry, organic chemistry, physics, mathematics and statistics, biochemistry and physiology, psychology, sociology, and English required by most medical and professional schools as prerequisites for admission. Additional upper-level science courses are also available and require prior completion of the basic sequence in biology, general chemistry, and calculus. These courses prepare students for the professional school entrance exams, e.g., MCAT, DAT, VCAT, OAT.
