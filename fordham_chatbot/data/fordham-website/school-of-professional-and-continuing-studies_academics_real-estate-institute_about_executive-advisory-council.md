**MaryAnne Gilmartin***Founder and CEO, MAG Partners LP*

*Special Advisor to the EAC*

MaryAnne Gilmartin is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of MAG Partners, a New York-based real estate development company she founded in 2020. Most recently, MaryAnne also served as interim Chief Executive Officer and Chair of the Board of Directors of Mack-Cali Realty Corporation.

Prior to founding MAG Partners, MaryAnne was CEO of L&L MAG. After a successful two-year partnership with L&L, MaryAnne spun out of L&L MAG to launch her own firm, MAG Partners. MaryAnne previously served as President and CEO of Forest City Ratner Companies, where she oversaw a period of game-changing ground-up development and managed its multimillion square foot residential, commercial and retail portfolio.

In her tenure at Forest City Ratner Companies, MaryAnne spearheaded the development of some of the most high-profile real estate projects in New York City. She led the efforts to build Barclays Center, the state-of-the-art sports and entertainment venue and the centerpiece of the $4.9 billion, 22-acre mixed-use Pacific Park Brooklyn development. She also oversaw the development of The New York Times Building, designed by world-renowned architect Renzo Piano; New York by Gehry, designed by award-winning architect Frank Gehry; and the Tata Innovation Center at Cornell Tech, a new office building that is a first-of-its-kind space for tech innovation, designed by Weiss/Manfredi on Roosevelt Island.
