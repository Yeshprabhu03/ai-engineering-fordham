Mortgage debt financing is a key component of most commercial real estate (CRE) decisions. Whether to increase equity returns, retain equity in order to acquire additional assets, gain tax benefits or to simply make up for a lack of equity capital, the use of leverage is common practice in most CRE transactions. As such, it is imperative that real estate professionals learn the principles of debt financing and how to develop a presentable financing request for the acquisition, development and construction (ADC) of income-producing properties. Topics include sources of capital; permanent debt financing for the acquisition of multifamily, office, retail, and industrial properties; commercial mortgage instruments and notes; underwriting; subject property description; operating income and expenses; sponsorship profile; credit analysis; property valuation; sizing the loan; refinance risk; loan request; lender’s term sheet; second mortgages; and mezzanine and interim loans.
