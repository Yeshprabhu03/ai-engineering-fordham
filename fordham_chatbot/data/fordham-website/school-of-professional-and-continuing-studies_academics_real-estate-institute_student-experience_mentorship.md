# Real Estate Institute Mentorship Opportunities

The Fordham MSRE proved to be a tremendous return on investment for me. From student orientation through graduation, I had a great experience. The faculty, mentorship program, building tours, and the collaboration with the REI Executive Advisory Council were excellent. Course content was thought-provoking, industry-relevant, and challenging. Most importantly, the job search thereafter - the Fordham REI exceeded my expectations and I would recommend the program to anyone interested in enhancing their career in the world of real estate!
