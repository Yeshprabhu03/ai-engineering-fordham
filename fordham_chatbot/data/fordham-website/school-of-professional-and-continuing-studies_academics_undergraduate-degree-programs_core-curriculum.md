# PCS Core Curriculum

As a Jesuit University, Fordham seeks to help students develop the habits of heart and mind that are the hallmarks of liberally educated men and women.

The PCS Core Curriculum assures that your undergraduate education is anchored, as a whole, in the liberal arts. It will enhance your writing and speaking skills, enable you to sample several fields of study, and provide you with a solid foundation for achievement in any of them.

The Core Curriculum consists of 12 courses. Advanced placement credit and college courses taken elsewhere may be considered for core transfer credit.

**ENGL 1102: Composition II - one required course**

This course will build competence and confidence in the use of language for analytic, dialogic, and expressive purposes, develop basic reasoning skills and skills of close and attentive reading, enrich an appreciation of the power and importance of language, and help students learn sound practices with respect to conventions of citation, quotation, paraphrase and documentation.

**HIST ****: Understanding Historical Change - one required course**

Through the introduction to the discipline of history, students will begin to achieve knowledge of the structure of societies, how they function, and how they change. Each section of the course will consider how to assess evidence, identify and evaluate differing and often contradictory explanations and arguments, and appraise the relative scale and importance of particular changes in the past. Students will be able to choose from different sections of the course each with the title Understanding Historical Change, and a descriptive subtitle such as Ancient Greece, American History, etc.

**Mathematical/Computational Reasoning - one required course **

The aim of this requirement is to develop the fundamental skills involved in mathematical and computational approaches to problem solving, reasoning and an understanding of our world. These skills also form the basis for advanced reasoning in many areas and provide a basis for testing logic, solving problems and evaluating mathematical and computational arguments and evidence in daily life. After completing this requirement, students will be prepared to explore quantitative and computational issues in the natural sciences, the social sciences and the humanities.

MATH 1100-Finite Mathematics

MATH 1203-Applied Calculus I

MATH 1206-Calculus I

MATH 1700-Mathematical Modeling

CISC 1100-Structures of Computer Science

CISC 1600-Computer Science I

In the Banner system, these courses will have the attribute Math/Computational Reasoning.

**Natural Science - one course in physical science or life science **

By exploring the natural sciences, students will gain understanding of scientific methodology and an appreciation of the social responsibility and ethics of science. By understanding how reasoning and experimental evidence lead to scientific conclusions, students will develop scientific literacy-the ability to understand the breakthroughs in science, medicine, and technology as educated, creative, responsible citizens. Students will also develop skills in critical thinking and discernment; qualitative and quantitative reasoning; written and oral communication; and formulation, analysis, and solution of complex problems. With knowledge of the basic principles of science, students will be able to evaluate the legal, moral, and ethical issues that will affect their lives after they graduate. Science courses for non-science majors include Health and Disease; Human Biology; Human Function and Dysfunction; Life on Planet Earth; Physics of Everyday Life; Alchemy to Astrophysics; People and the Living Environment; and Ecology: A Human Approach.

Science majors will fulfill this core requirement through their major courses.

**ADVANCED DISCIPLINARY STUDY **

This portion of the Core enables students to deepen and extend their disciplinary study and enrich their major courses, which they will be taking concurrently, through a diverse spectrum of advanced courses, thereby assuring the achievement of intellectual perspective with breadth. The following upper-level courses will build on the knowledge, skills, and methodological foundations of the disciplinary introductions to develop and extend their awareness of questions and approaches outside their majors. Courses at this level will generally be numbered in the 3000 range, and may be taken when students have completed the introductory disciplinary courses in the area.

**PHIL 3000: Philosophical Ethics - one required course **

This course involves philosophical reflection on the major normative ethical theories underlying moral decision making in our everyday lives. The principal focus of the course is a systematic introduction to the main normative ethical theories, i.e., eudaimonism, natural law ethics, deontological ethics, utilitarianism, virtue ethics, and feminism. The differences among these approaches are illuminated by studying various moral issues. In each section of the course, at least half the readings will be selected from Aristotle and Kant. Each section will include writings by at least one contemporary figure.

**THEO 3100-3724 Sacred Texts and Traditions - one required course **

The second theology course, selected from a group of offerings relating to sacred texts and traditions, builds on the foundation of critical reasoning about traditions in the first theology course through analytical study of one religious textual tradition. The sections of this course will offer students a variety of texts from which to choose. All sections will draw on the disciplines of history, literary analysis, and theology, interpreting religious traditions and texts as both historically embedded and always evolving responses to the experience of the transcendent in human life.

**Advanced Disciplinary Course in Literature, History, or Social Science - one required course **

Following the introductory literature, history, and social science courses, this requirement will enable the student to achieve a sharper focus and more detailed knowledge of complex literary, historical, or social methods, materials, interactions, and processes. To fulfill the requirement, one advanced disciplinary course will be taken in one of the following disciplines:


- an advanced literature course numbered 2000 or above, or
- an advanced history course numbered 2000 or above, or
- an advanced social science course numbered 2000 or above

**Senior Values Seminar - one required course **

This course will be numbered in the 4000 range, and will cover topics in ethical issues and moral choices through a variety of disciplines.
