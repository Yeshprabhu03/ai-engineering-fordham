# PCS Pre-Med/Pre-Health

The Fordham Pre-Med/Pre-Health Program of the School of Professional and Continuing Studies (PCS) is for college graduates interested in a career in the health professions but still in need of the prerequisite science courses.

In keeping with the PCS mission to serve adult students, the program offers the pre-med curriculum primarily in the evening, on weekends, and during the summer to prepare students for application to medical, dental or veterinary schools, nursing, physician assistant or physical therapy programs.

Classes are offered at Fordham's Rose Hill, Lincoln Center, and Westchester campuses. A limited number of day classes are also available during the academic year.

**Admission Requirements**

Candidates submit an online application for PCS admission as non-matriculated students, a personal statement, request official transcripts for all post-secondary school coursework to be sent directly from the institution to PCS and receive an admission interview teleconference with the Director. The general requirement for consideration is a minimum 3.00 GPA.

Official transcripts should be sent directly from the academic institution to:

Once admitted to the Fordham Pre-Medical/Pre-Health Program, students are expected to complete all remaining courses at Fordham. Students who have completed the greater of 6 courses or 30 credits in Fordham PCS with a minimum 3.2 GPA in the entire basic curriculum, whether completed at Fordham or prior to admission, may apply for a Committee on Heath Professions (CHP) Evaluation. All courses in the basic curriculum must be completed prior to or concurrent with the professional school admissions test and no later than the end of the first summer session of the application year in which the Committee Evaluation is sought. The Committee evaluation letter is based on a student's academic portfolio which includes the following: coursework, transcripts, personal statement, self-assessment and biographical information on personal history including volunteer and/or internship experience and research experience, faculty recommendations, and a personal interview with members of the Committee.
