## Get Started

You can apply for admission for either the fall or spring semesters. When admitted, you'll be invited to an orientation program for new students where you can meet with counselors to advise you in selecting your classes.

### Who Should Apply

We welcome men and women who wish to begin or resume their college degree programs primarily through evening, weekend, and online class attendance, and usually on a part-time basis in light of their career and/or family responsibilities.

While age is not a consideration, if you're applying for admission to Fordham University directly from high school, you will generally be referred to the full-time day colleges of the University.
