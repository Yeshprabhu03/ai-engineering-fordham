# PCS Financial Aid and Scholarships

## Undergraduate Degree Financial Aid

Financial Aid is available for both full- and part-time students in the School of Professional and Continuing Studies (PCS). (For purposes of financial aid, full-time students are those who take 12 or more credits per semester; part-time students take 6 to 11 credits.)

The Office of Student Financial Services on each campus assists students in identifying grants, scholarships, and loans with which to fund part of their education. They also assist with the application process for Federal Pell Grants, New York State’s Tuition Assistance Plan (TAP), Aid to Part-time Students (APTS), and Stafford Student Loan Programs, and can provide information on the Hope Scholarship Federal Tax Credit for part-time adult students.

In addition to the availability of these aid and loan programs, Fordham is one of the few universities which offers grant and scholarship funds from its own resources to assist adult learners. In Fordham School of Professional and Continuing Studies, students can qualify for several of these programs.
