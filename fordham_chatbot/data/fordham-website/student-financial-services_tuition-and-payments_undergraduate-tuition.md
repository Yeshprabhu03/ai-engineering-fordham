# Undergraduate Tuition and Costs of Attendance

Tuition is one component of the total cost of attendance (COA). Tuition specifically covers the cost of academic instruction, while the COA consists of standard school expenses (tuition, fees, and books) and an estimate of a student’s standard living expenses (housing, food, transportation, and other miscellaneous expenses). Each student’s financial needs are different, so the estimated COA may be less depending on the student’s circumstances.
