# Student Employment

Student employment is more than a job. It is an experience which involves a commitment as well as interaction with the Fordham community. Student workers are highly valued by faculty, staff, and students. This hands-on work experience provides a well-rounded education for the student, and also establishes a foundation upon which future employment goals can be built. The Student Employment staff is available to assist you in finding the most suitable job for you.

**Objective**

The objective of the SEO is to match students with positions that will enable them to learn and practice valuable work-related skills and to help meet educationally related expenses while studying at Fordham University. Employment on campus is another opportunity to be a part of the Fordham community while earning income to meet your day to day educational expenses.

**Program Information**

![Walsh Lab](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/walshlab4_1.jpg)

The Academic Year Program (part-time, typically 10 to 15 hours per week) begins the first day of classes and ends on Commencement day. The Summer Program (full-time, 24 hours per week) begins the Monday after Commencement and ends the day before Fall classes begin.

The hours a student works are verified and approved by their supervisor. These hours are submitted to Student Employment, who then verifies and authorizes payment of wages. Student workers receive payment on a bi-weekly basis (twice a month) according to the dates outlined on the Payroll Calendars. Earnings are not credited to a student's university account. Payment is made directly to the student either by check or direct deposit.
