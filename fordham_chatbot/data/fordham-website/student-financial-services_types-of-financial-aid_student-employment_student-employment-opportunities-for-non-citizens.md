# Student Employment Opportunities for Non-Citizens

The Office of Student Employment is happy to assist with finding an employment opportunity for F-1 International students.

For F-1 international students, on-campus employment is "incident to status." This means that you are allowed to work on campus at any point while you are pursuing your studies and maintaining legal status. On-campus employment is limited to 10-13 hours per week while school is in session, but may increase to full-time (28 hrs/week) during the summer program.

Fordham students may seek on-campus jobs at Rose Hill & Lincoln Center.

In order to secure on campus employment, a list of departments that may have job opportunities are listed under [non-work study opportunities](/student-financial-services/types-of-financial-aid/student-employment/types-of-jobs/#d.en.182745).
