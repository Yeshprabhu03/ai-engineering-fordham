# Types of Jobs

**Job Descriptions**

Student employment is more than a job. It is an experience which involves a commitment as well as interaction with the Fordham community. Student employees are highly valued by faculty, staff, and students. This hands-on work experience provides a well-rounded education for the student, and also establishes a foundation upon which future employment goals can be built.
