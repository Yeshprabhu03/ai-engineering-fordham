# Undergraduate Federal and State Grants

Your eligibility for the below grants is estimated using the information you report on the [financial aid forms](/student-financial-services/forms--worksheets/). You must comply with all [program requirements](https://www.fordham.edu/student-financial-services/policies-and-terms/#sap) to receive these funds. Please follow up on all requests for information from federal and state agencies.

## Federal and State Aid Administered by Fordham University

### Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant (SEOG)

This federal grant is awarded from a limited amount of funding administered by Fordham University. It is used to provide assistance to students who demonstrate exceptional need.

### Federal Work-Study Program

Work-study wages are paid bi-weekly for the hours actually worked in the form of a paycheck sent directly to the student. The wages are not credited to your Fordham student account. The maximum annual earnings are limited to the amount listed on your award offer. If work study is included in the financial aid offer you accept, the Student Employment office will contact you during the summer to provide information regarding placement in a position. Employment is an opportunity to earn income that will help you meet your day-to-day educational expenses.

### Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP) Grant

This aid is limited to New York state residents who have been designated as eligible for the [HEOP program](/academics/academic-resources/heop/). It is gift aid, which does not have to be repaid. Part of this aid is credited to your account. If you are a commuting student, the maintenance portion of the HEOP grant will be paid to you in the form of a stipend.

## Government Grants and Loans

### New York State Grant - Tuition Assistance Program (TAP)

New York State TAP eligibility is currently based on the family's New York State taxable income and information submitted on the FAFSA and the New York State Express Tap Application (ETA). You will automatically be sent an ETA if you are a New York State Resident, and listed at least one New York State school on your FAFSA. While there are some regulatory and academic requirements to receive TAP, there are waivers available for [certain situations](https://www.fordham.edu/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/enrollment-group/academic-records/nys-tap-tuition-assistance-program-information/).

An actual award certificate from New York State Higher Education Services Corporation ([NYSHESC](http://www.hesc.ny.gov/)) will be sent to you. This grant may only be used at colleges within New York State. If you do not receive an award certificate from NYSHESC within four weeks after filing for TAP or within 3 weeks of the passing of the State budget (whichever is later), contact [NYSHESC](http://www.hesc.ny.gov/) at 888-697-4372. [Check on your TAP status](http://www.hesc.ny.gov/).

New York State Aid for Part-Time Study (A.P.T.S)

These funds are limited and are awarded based on NYS net taxable income, academic performance, availability of funds, and the number of credits. The maximum award is $2,000 and students must be enrolled for at least 3 but less than 12 credits per term.

Students should apply at least one month prior to the start of classes for APTS. The application can be found in the [Forms and Worksheets](/student-financial-services/forms--worksheets/) section. Students must submit this application as well as their NYS taxes to Student Financial Services. No funds will be awarded later than 30 days after the last day of drop/add registration.

**Other State Grants**

There are some states which allow students to carry state aid with them to colleges outside of their home state. These may include, but are not limited to, Vermont, Delaware, Maryland, and Iowa. If applicable, check with your guidance counselor to determine how to apply or contact your [state education agency](https://www.nasfaa.org/state_financial_aid_programs) for more information.

### Federal Grants and Loans

Your eligibility for these awards is estimated using the information you report on the financial aid forms. Eligibility for federal aid is determined by filing the FAFSA at studentaid.gov. An email will be sent to the address provided on the FAFSA within approximately five days with a link to your FAFSA Submission Summary (FSS). Otherwise you will receive a paper FSS in the mail in about two weeks. Be sure Fordham is listed. Review your FSS carefully and make any necessary corrections to ensure your information is accurate and complete. You may also check the status of a submitted FAFSA online at studentaid.gov or by calling 800-4-FEDAID. You must also comply with all program requirements to receive these funds from government agencies.

### Federal Pell Grant

The Federal Pell Grant program provides federal funds to exceptionally needy students. Eligibility for this grant is determined annually by the FAFSA SAI, which is found on your FSS.

### Yellow Ribbon

The Yellow Ribbon Program is part of the Post-9/11 GI Bill for eligible veterans or their dependents who are eligible for 100-percent benefits. This program helps fund tuition and fees that exceed the amount covered by the basic Post-9/11 benefits. Awards are determined by Veterans Affairs (VA) guidelines and Fordham’s annual Yellow Ribbon agreement with the VA.

**Review your Federal FAFSA Submission Summary (FSS) carefully.**This is a summary of the information you reported on your FAFSA. Read all messages and follow up where required. Be sure that all required sections are complete and accurate. If you have estimated your income or if you are eligible but have not provided your consent and approval to use the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX) to transfer federal tax information, update your income data and make other corrections at studentaid.gov. Make certain you have supplied Fordham with your accurate Social Security number and that it matches the number reported on the FAFSA. Keep a copy for your records. Review your financial aid offer carefully. Read all messages, terms, and conditions. Be certain that you understand the criteria of the awards you accept. All aid labeled “grant,” with the exception of the Metro Grant, is need-based and may be reduced if need decreases. Adhere to deadlines. Keep the financial aid offer (and any revised offer) for your own records. Financial aid awards and messages can be accessed through the Financial Aid Portal at fordham.edu/faportal. You should also keep a copy of all documents that you submit to the Office of Student Financial Services.**Notify the Office of Student Financial Services immediately if you receive external awards**(e.g., private scholarships and grants), tuition remission, or have a change in enrollment or commuter/ resident status. Respond immediately to all requests from the Office of Student Financial Services. Beginning in May, students who are selected for verification by the Department of Education will receive an email from Fordham University requesting all necessary tax/ financial documents. Your initial financial aid offer is based on information submitted by you on your financial aid forms. If your documentation differs from the data on the FAFSA, aid may be adjusted. Verification of requested documents must be completed within two weeks of notification. Failure to comply will result in processing delays and/or cancellation of your aid. Review the University Code of Conduct and Academic Programs, Policies, and Procedures for the school to which you have been admitted. For further information, you can refer to the Undergraduate Bulletin online at fordham.edu/ undergraduatebulletin.**Renew your aid by applying annually.**Financial aid is awarded on an annual basis. For aid to be renewed, the FAFSA must be submitted by the filing deadline in early April. Each year the deadline is published on our website. All students must maintain satisfactory academic progress, a minimum 2.0 cumulative GPA (or higher, if specified in the terms of the award), continued demonstration of financial need (for need-based awards), and compliance with other University policies and the University Code of Conduct. Students who defer their admission to a future year will need to reapply for aid and will receive a new financial aid offer. Some aid programs may have additional criteria for renewal. The renewal criteria for specific awards is generally described in the financial aid offer and/or award messages. State and federal programs may have additional requirements. Failure to meet Fordham’s published filing deadline or minimum GPA requirements may result in loss of aid in future years. Continuing students will be notified of their financial aid renewal by email. After notification, financial aid awards can be accessed and accepted through the**Financial Aid Portal at**.[fordham.edu/faportal](https://fordham.edu/faportal)
