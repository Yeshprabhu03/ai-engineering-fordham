Loan disbursements begin

**three business days**before the start of each term. The timing of your disbursement depends on the loan period you select, with your total loan amount evenly distributed across the semesters or trimesters included in your loan request.A credit balance occurs when the funds applied to your account exceed your direct charges. This will be

[refunded](/student-financial-services/policies-and-terms/)within 14 days of either the first day of classes*or*the date funds were applied to your account—**whichever is later**. Refunds can only be issued after all unpaid charges on your bill are satisfied.

Students who received a request from the financial aid office to provide documentation to clarify their federal loan default status have options to regain eligibility for federal aid. If you have already brought your defaulted loans back into good standing, please provide the financial aid office with documentation from your loan servicer. The Department of Education provides helpful resources regarding

[federal loan default status](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/default/get-out). -
This is a period during which repayment of the principal and interest of your loan is temporarily delayed. During a deferment/forbearance, you do not need to make payments. You are responsible for paying the interest that accrues (accumulates) during the deferment period, but your payment is not due during the deferment period. You can request a deferment or forbearance by contacting your loan servicer.Your loans are automatically put into deferment if you are a student in a degree granting program and enrolled at least ½ time.See the
