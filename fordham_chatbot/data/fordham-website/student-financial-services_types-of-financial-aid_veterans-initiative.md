**Post-9/11 GI Bill**

The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides financial support for education. [Learn about exact benefits and criteria for eligibility](https://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/post911_gibill.asp).

Generally, the following individuals may be eligible. Only the VA can confirm your eligibility.

- Individuals with at least 90 days of aggregate active duty service on or after September 11, 2001, or
- Individuals discharged with a service-connected disability after 30 days. The discharge must be an honorable discharge.

-
These benefits apply to both graduate and undergraduate education programs. The Post-9/11 GI Bill will pay for eligible individuals' tuition and mandatory fees (paid directly to the school) capped at $29,920.95 for their academic year. Mandatory fees exclude room and board, study abroad fees, parking fees, penalty fees, health center fees, or other fees not mandated by the university for all students in a specific program. Health insurance is considered a mandatory fee and is covered by the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Generally, veterans receive up to 36 months of entitlement under the Post-9/11 GI Bill.

Tuition and fees are reported to the VA net of tuition specific aid, including scholarships, grants, waivers, external tuition specific scholarships, or other Federal, State (with the exception of New York State Tuition Assistance Program awards), institutional, and employer-based assistance other than loans or any Title IV funds.

-
Service members enrolled in the Post-9/11 GI Bill program, with the approval of the Department of Defense, may be able to transfer unused educational benefits to their spouses or children.

**Yellow Ribbon Program**

The Yellow Ribbon Program allows schools to voluntarily enter into an agreement with the Veterans Administration (VA) to help fund the portion of the student's tuition and fees that exceeds actual tuition and fees of $29,920.95 per academic year for a private school.

For the 2025-2026 academic year, Fordham University has agreed to contribute 50% of those expenses with an unlimited maximum contribution for traditional undergraduate students, unlimited maximum contribution for non-traditional undergraduate students, and an unlimited maximum contribution for both graduate students and doctoral students. The VA will match the same amount that Fordham University is contributing dollar for dollar and issue payment directly to the University.

Fordham’s Yellow Ribbon agreement and basic Post-9/11 benefits are expected to cover tuition and mandatory fees at all schools.

**Please review Fordham’s Yellow Ribbon agreement for the 2025-2026 academic year, for students eligible for the maximum benefit rate of 100% (based on service requirements), in the tabs below: **
