## FILL OUT THE FAFSA AND CSS PROFILE

To maximize your opportunities for scholarships and grants, we recommend you fill out the Free Application for [ Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa) and the

[. The CSS Profile is required to be considered for scholarships and grants from Fordham (and many other colleges), while the FAFSA helps determine the federal aid you can receive. These forms help Fordham understand your family’s financial situation and determine the types of aid you may be qualified to receive, which can help make college more affordable.](https://cssprofile.collegeboard.org/)

** Before applying for financial aid you will need to apply to Fordham University.*

## REVIEW THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF AID OFFERED

It can be easy to get overwhelmed by the listed price and mistakenly think that a Fordham education is beyond your reach. So we encourage you to focus on the net price. At Fordham, more than 90% of our first-year students receive some type of financial aid.

Merit-based aid and need-based aid are both known as gift aid. This type of aid can come in the form of [ scholarships and grants](/student-financial-services/types-of-financial-aid/undergraduate-scholarships-and-grants/). (You can also take out loans, but—unlike scholarships and grants—loans need to be paid back.) There are also many organizations that offer additional funds through separate applications and competitions.

**Merit-based scholarships:** This type of aid is awarded based on your academic history or your skill set in a particular area.

**Need-based aid:** Many universities and colleges help you cover the cost of college based on your financial situation. There are also funds available through the government, such as Pell Grants, depending on your family’s finances.

## CALCULATE YOUR ESTIMATED COLLEGE COST

The net price of your education is what you’ll actually pay for tuition, housing, and meals when you factor in your financial aid offers. Keep in mind that in addition to your direct charges, there are often indirect costs, such as textbooks and college supplies—Fordham will help you plan for these too.

## CREATE A COLLEGE PAYMENT PLAN

Once you’ve received your financial aid offer, the next step is figuring out how to cover the remaining costs.

Determining the combination of financing options that serves you best is not an easy task. [ You may use our Financing Fordham Worksheet to design a plan that is right for you](https://myapps.web.fordham.edu/ptl/financial_aid/scholarship_forms/checklist/checklist_calculator.jsp?&_ga=2.200778157.2066415039.1757334500-942308305.1741359307).

**Reference guide for financing your Fordham education**

Here are a few ways to help you make paying for college easier and more affordable:

**Fordham Monthly Payment Plan**

Fordham encourages families to use the interest-free [monthly payment plan](https://www.fordham.edu/student-financial-services/tuition-and-payments/paying-your-bill/#mpp) before loan programs to cover the cost of college. Explore an interest-free 10-month plan that does not require a credit review.

**Fordham Tuition Stabilization Plan**

The cost of college increases from year to year. With the Fordham Tuition Stabilization Plan, you eliminate future tuition increases for up to four years by prepaying the tuition for future terms at the current tuition rate.

**Work-Study:** The [Federal Work-Study program](/student-financial-services/types-of-financial-aid/student-employment/) provides part-time jobs to help you gain work experience while earning money that can be put toward expenses (books, food, etc.). But remember, you have to submit the FAFSA to see if you qualify.

**Federal Loan Programs**

[Loans](/student-financial-services/types-of-financial-aid/undergraduate-loan-resources/)can help you and your family cover the net price of college. But remember: Loans have to be paid back, usually with interest. We encourage you to start with loans offered through the federal government first.

[Private loans](/student-financial-services/types-of-financial-aid/undergraduate-loan-resources/#d.en.187078) are also available, but they often have a higher interest rate than those from the federal government.

You and your family will be assessing your resources and planning how to meet your college expenses. We have listed examples of some financing options which families have available to them. These aid offers are simulated and we do not intend to imply that they are typical.

**Example 1:**Lisa is a commuter student. Her estimated direct charges for 2025–2026 are $67,936. She is receiving financial aid, including Federal Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loans, in the amount of $34,000. Her remaining direct charges for the award year are approximately $33,936.*Options:

- The
[Fordham Monthly Payment Plan](/student-financial-services/tuition-and-payments/paying-your-bill/#d.en.186486)can spread the $33,936 interest-free over a 10-month period with a monthly payment of $3,394. - Lisa’s parents may borrow a $33,936
[Federal Direct PLUS Loan (PLUS)](/student-financial-services/types-of-financial-aid/undergraduate-loan-resources/)with a monthly payment option of approximately $430 over 10 years. Her parents may choose to extend repayment for up to 25 years, lowering the monthly payment. - Lisa’s parents estimate they can afford approximately $1,200 a month. They can combine a 10-month payment plan for $9,000 ($900 per month) with a PLUS Loan for $24,936 (approximately $315 per month) to cover Lisa’s balance. PLUS Loan payments may be deferred until graduation.
- Lisa can secure a private education loan with a creditworthy cosigner, or the loan can be in a friend or relative’s name.

*Parents and students can borrow to cover books, course materials, supplies, and other miscellaneous indirect expenses.***Example 2:**John is a resident student. His estimated direct charges, including living expenses, which include food and housing costs, for 2025–2026, are $93,110. He is receiving financial aid, including Federal Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loans, in the amount of $33,500. His remaining direct charges for the award year are approximately $59,610.*Options

- The
[Fordham Monthly Payment Plan](/student-financial-services/tuition-and-payments/paying-your-bill/#d.en.186486)can spread the $59,610 interest-free over a 10-month period with a monthly payment of $5,961. - The family may secure additional cash flow by borrowing against home equity, investments, an insurance policy, a Supplemental Retirement Annuity (SRA), or savings.
- Any combination of options can be used to finance John’s education. For example, John’s family may want to pay $10,000 in cash, an additional $10,000 using the monthly payment plan ($1,000 per month), and borrow $39,610 (approximately $502 per month) through one of the loan programs.
- Fordham’s Tuition Stabilization Plan can be used to freeze John's tuition at the first-year rate for two, three, or four years, avoiding tuition increases for the prepaid years.
