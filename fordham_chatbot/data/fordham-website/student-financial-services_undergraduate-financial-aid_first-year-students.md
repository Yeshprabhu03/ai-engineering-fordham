[Eligibility ]

Financial aid is available to U.S. citizens and [eligible non-citizens](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens). State, federal, and institutional aid is determined by estimated family contribution, enrollment status, academic performance, and availability of funds. See our [net price calculator](/student-financial-services/tuition-and-payments/undergraduate-tuition/net-price-calculator/) for a preliminary estimate of federal, state, and institutional aid eligibility.

**TIP: **Make sure Fordham has your correct social security number on file and that you file both the FAFSA and CSS Profile using the name and number printed on your social security card.
