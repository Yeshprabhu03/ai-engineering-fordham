How to Apply

The process to apply for financial aid is essentially the same for all prospective students. Complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and CSS Profile to receive maximum consideration for all types of aid including Fordham grants and scholarships. To be considered exclusively for federal aid, only the FAFSA is required.
