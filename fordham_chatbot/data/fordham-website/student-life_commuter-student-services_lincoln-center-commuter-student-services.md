The Lincoln Center campus of Fordham University provides students with a unique experience, and one of the contributing factors of this is the large commuter population.

Approximately 40% of the 3,500 full-time, undergraduate students at Lincoln Center are commuters. A variety of on-campus programs exist to enhance the commuter experience at the University.

Commuter Student Services (CSS) are offered through the [Office for Student Involvement](/student-life/student-involvement/office-for-student-involvement-at-lincoln-center/) within the Division of Student Affairs. We offer a variety of services and resources for both traditional live-at-home commuters and off-campus commuters. These include:

Special Grants for Commuters

[Metro Grants](/student-life/commuter-student-services/lincoln-center-commuter-student-services/information-and-services/grants-and-funding-for-commuters/) and other funding for $15,000 a year or more.

Commuter First-Year Mentors

First year students are assigned a [Commuter First-Year Mentor](/student-life/commuter-student-services/lincoln-center-commuter-student-services/commuter-first-year-mentors/) that serves as a resource for anything related to Fordham.

Commuting Students Association Membership

Lincoln Center's [Commuting Students Association](/student-life/commuter-student-services/lincoln-center-commuter-student-services/commuting-students-association/) organizes events and activities that are open to the entire Fordham community but is held at commuter-friendly times.
