# Lincoln Center Commuter First-Year Mentors

The Commuter First-Year Mentors (CFM) program consists of upperclassmen commuter students who guide and support the incoming first-years in every way possible. CFMs help the first-years adapt to college life socially and academically by maintaining contact with them, and by setting up various types of programs throughout the fall semester. In addition, they share their experiences both as commuters and as Fordham students, as well as the knowledge that they have gained throughout their time here at Fordham.

In August, each incoming commuter first-year student will receive an email from their assigned Commuter First-Year Mentor. All mentors will be present to meet first-year students at the Commuter and Transfer Barbecue and at New Student Orientation. In addition, mentors host a variety of programs for commuter first-years throughout their first year.
