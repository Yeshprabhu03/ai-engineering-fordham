# Commuter Hangouts

Commuter Student Services (CSS) wants to remind you that there are places on campus where you can go to feel welcome and comfortable. In addition, for Fall 2020, there are additional [LC Study Rooms](/student-life/student-involvement/office-for-student-involvement-at-lincoln-center/lc-study-rooms/) available to all commuter and resident students.

### Student Lounge
