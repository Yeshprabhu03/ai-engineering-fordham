Plan Your Travel Ahead

Thinking about commuting issues in advance can help new students prepare for times when their routine may become disrupted because of weather, mass transit delays, or the need to be on campus at night.

If you plan to leave campus very late at night alone, you may want to consider driving, planning for someone to pick you up, or making plans to travel with a friend.

Be Prepared

Commuters using public transportation should be prepared to find an alternate route home in the event of a mass transit delay or service stoppage. It is a good idea to know the cost of a taxi ride home and carry that amount of cash at all times.
