Commuter Student Services is offered through the [Office for Student Involvement](/student-life/student-involvement/office-for-student-involvement-at-rose-hill/) and we are here to support your success as a new Fordham Ram.

Approximately 40% of the full-time, undergraduate students at Rose Hill are commuters. A variety of on-campus programs and excursions exist to enhance the commuter experience at the University.

Additionally, we offer a variety of services and resources for both traditional live-at-home commuters and off-campus commuters. These include:

**Special Grants for Commuters**

[Metro Grants](/student-life/commuter-student-services/rose-hill-commuter-student-services/information-and-services/grants-and-funding-for-commuters/)and other funding for $10.000 a year or more.

**Commuter Assistants (Upperclassmen Mentors)**

First-year students are automatically assigned a [Commuter Assistant](/student-life/commuter-student-services/rose-hill-commuter-student-services/commuter-assistants/) that serves as a resource for anything related to Fordham. Additionally, Commuter Student Services has implemented an opt-in program for upperclassmen students that would like continued support past their first-year as well as for students moving off-campus!
