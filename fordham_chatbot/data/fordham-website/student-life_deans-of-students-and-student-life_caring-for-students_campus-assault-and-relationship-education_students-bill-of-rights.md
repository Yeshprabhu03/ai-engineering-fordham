All students have the right to:

- Make a report to local law enforcement and/or state police;

- Make a decision about whether or not to disclose a crime or violation and participate in the judicial or conduct process and/or criminal justice process free from pressure by the institution;
- Participate in a process that is fair, impartial, and provides adequate notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard;
- Be treated with dignity and to receive from the institution courteous, fair and respectful health care and counseling services, where available;
- Be free from any suggestion that the reporting individual is at fault when these crimes and violations are committed, or should have acted in a different manner to avoid such crimes or violations;
- Describe the incident to as few institution representatives as practicable and not be required to unnecessarily repeat a description of the incident;
- Be protected from retaliation by the institution, any student, the accused and/or the respondent, and/or their friends, family and acquaintances within the jurisdiction of the institution;
- Access to at least one level of appeal of a determination;
- Be accompanied by an advisor of choice who may assist and advise the reporting individual, accused, or respondent throughout the judicial or conduct process including during all meetings and hearings related to such process;

**Notification of Rights at the Time of First Disclosure**

All reporting individuals have the right to make a report to the Department of Public Safety, local law enforcement, and/or state police or choose not to report; to report the incident to Fordham; to be protected by Fordham from retaliation for reporting an incident; and to receive assistance and resources from Fordham.

**Transcript Notation**

In keeping with New York State Education Law Article 129-B (“Enough Is Enough”), if a student is suspended or expelled from the University after being found responsible for a crime of violence, including but not limited to sexual violence, and/or other crimes that meet the reporting requirements pursuant to the federal Clery Act, the University will record that fact on the student’s transcript. It will be noted that they were “suspended after a finding of responsibility for a code of conduct violation” or “expelled after a finding of responsibility for a code of conduct violation.” For a respondent who withdraws from Fordham while conduct charges are pending and declines to complete the conduct process, a notation will be placed on the transcript that the student “withdrew with conduct charges pending.” For more information, see the Sexual Misconduct Policy and Procedures section of the Student Handbook.
