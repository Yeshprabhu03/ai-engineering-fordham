# Resolving the Situation

## Resolving the Situation

**If you have called Public Safety**, know that they will arrive to assist you as soon as possible.

**If you are able to calm the student down** and feel you do not need an immediate response, discuss with the student the next step for following up. Public Safety, Counseling and Psychological Services and/or the dean of students can offer support and guidance to you and/or the student. A likely option is making an appointment for the student with the counseling office.

**Because this may not be an isolated incident**, and because a fuller picture of a student emerges when various administrators are alerted and can then pool their information, it is important that you also share the information with one or more of the following:

- Your department chair
- Appropriate class dean
- Counseling Center
- Department of Public Safety
- Dean of students at each campus

## The academic dean at the appropriate college or professional school should also be notified:
