# What to do in an EMERGENCY

An alcohol or drug emergency is a situation in which you believe that a student’s possible use of alcohol or other substance may put that student or others at risk for harm or injury.

If you are with the student, DO NOT leave the student alone or let them leave. Contact us immediately.

Contact the dean of students (during business hours) the Public Safety supervisor (after hours or over weekends) and clearly state that you need to report a ALCOHOL/ SUBSTANCE ABUSE EMERGENCY. The dean of students or a member of the staff will respond directly to you. You may also walk the student to the offices below.

Staff in these offices are trained to find a professional who will assist immediately.

Faculty members should follow these procedures even if the student’s behaviors ambiguous.
