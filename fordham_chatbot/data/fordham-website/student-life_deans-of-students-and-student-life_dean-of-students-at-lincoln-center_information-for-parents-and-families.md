# Information for Parents and Families at Lincoln Center

Dear Parents, Families, and Guardians,

As the summer rolls on, I will be posting our various communications to students and parents/families here for easy access.

As always, please call the offices whose correspondence is included below or my office ([[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) / 212.636.6250) with any questions or if we can assist.

Sincerely,

AVP/Dean Campbell
