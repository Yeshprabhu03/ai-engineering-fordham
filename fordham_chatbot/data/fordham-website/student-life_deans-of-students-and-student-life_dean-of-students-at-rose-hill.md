To assist in achieving the University's mission to train men and women for others, the many offices, programs and services in Student Life are devoted to the ideals in the student affairs mission, and are committed to both caring for and challenging students outside the classroom.

Further information can be found in the Division of Students Affairs Mission.

Through the work of involvement, students not only fully realize their educational potential, but also assist in the operation and decision-making of our University. Dedicated student leaders working in areas as various as student government, community service, campus ministry, the resident assistant staff, [Orientation](/student-life/events-and-activities/student-orientation/student-orientation-at-rose-hill/), or special interest clubs and organizations educate others while being educated themselves. Each student helps to advance the core mission of the university through devoted service and by becoming educators as well as students. Student life staff strive to work closely with students to find these opportunities while themselves serving students as living examples of the lives we hope students will someday lead themselves.

The various policies and processes for which Student Life is responsible are meant to be infused with educational value and to help build a community that balances rights with responsibilities and respect. To achieve this important goal, the Dean of Students works closely with the Assistant Dean of Students and Director of Residential Life and the Assistant Director for Student Conduct to oversee the Student Conduct System and the community standards which forms its foundation. The high expectations for personal conduct found in our community's standards, in turn, make our community the training ground for men and women for others called for in the mission. The leaders in service trained at Fordham lead future generations of students to the same goals and then, at Commencement, leave us to serve the world.

All members of our community are invited to reach out to the Dean of Students or any member of the Student Life staff with questions, concerns or for assistance.
