# Mental Health and Medical-Related Re-Entry Process

Students who seek to resume study after an emergency, crisis, hospitalization, unexplained absence, medical leave of absence (MLOA), withdrawal (WD), or other incident due to mental health and/or medical reasons go through the re-entry process (also outlined in the University Regulations) before resuming classes or returning to University housing. Once the college or school confirms that a student is eligible to resume study, the student is sent instructions on how to proceed.

We are here to help students in their return to Fordham and to assist in navigating the re-entry process.

For more specific information on the Mental Health and Medical-Related Re-Entry Process requirements, please see [the relevant University Regulation](https://www.fordham.edu/student-life/deans-of-students-and-student-life/student-handbook/university-regulations/a---z-listing/mental-healthmedical-re-entry-process/).

This web page is provided to assist with instructions on the re-entry process. Please read all information under the section below that applies to your situation.

**Students currently away on a Medical Leave of Absence, who have withdrawn from the University, or who have otherwise taken extended time away from the University for mental health/medical reasons: **submit the documents noted by the specific deadlines published on this web page to be eligible for re-entry for your desired semester.

**Goals of the Process**

For more specific information on the Mental Health and Medical-Related Re-Entry Process requirements, please see [the relevant University Regulation](https://www.fordham.edu/student-life/deans-of-students-and-student-life/student-handbook/university-regulations/a---z-listing/mental-healthmedical-re-entry-process/). The Goals of the Process are to:

- Ensure that students are ready to return to classes and/or university housing after an emergency, crisis, hospitalization, unexplained absence, medical leave of absence (LOA) or withdrawal (WD);
- Ensure coordination among separate areas and offices associated with the re-entry process;
- Give students and families a clear set of expectations and requirements for re-entry; and
- Ensure that Fordham University is adequately prepared to support students as they return to academics and housing.

-
Similar to return after Medical Leave of Absence, the University works with student to ensure smooth transition from hospitalization. After hospitalization, and unless the Dean of Students/Student Affairs staff or designate authorizes return, students apply through the re-entry process before returning to classes and/or university housing. If a student does not return home after hospitalization, Student Affairs staff must first approve a return to university housing through this process.

To assess a student’s readiness to return to campus after a hospitalization, the following documents must be submitted as soon as possible after discharge to the appropriate campus:

- Hospital discharge summary (including diagnosis, treatment provided at hospital and recommendations for treatment at discharge);
[Medical Community Provider Form](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/student-life/pdfs/Community_Provider_Form___Medical_Oct-2022.pdf)or[Mental Health Community Provider Form](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/student-life/pdfs/Community_Provider_Form___Mental_Health_-Oct-2022.pdf)

Students returning home after mental health-related hospitalization are required to schedule and attend at least two full sessions with a licensed mental health provider and have that provider complete the Community Provider Report Form upon completion of the two full sessions;[Release of Information](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/pdfs/jadu-single-folder-pdfs/Re_entry_Release_of_Information.pdf)for the provider completing the Community Provider Form.

The re-entry process will move forward once this documentation has been received and reviewed. Students will be contacted if your documentation is incomplete, or if additional information is needed or to schedule a meeting with a member of the Student Affairs staff.

**Please note**: Each college/school has a limit to the number of class absences permitted. Please be sure review the attendance policy and contact your academic dean or advising staff for specific information. -
