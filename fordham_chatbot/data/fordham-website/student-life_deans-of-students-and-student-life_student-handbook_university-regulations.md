# University Regulations

All communities have standards of conduct. This is especially the case with the intentional communities of colleges and universities. At Fordham University, these standards spring from the Mission of the University and are integral to the development of each student.

Guided by its Catholic and Jesuit traditions, Fordham fosters the intellectual, moral and religious development of its students and prepares them for leadership in a global society.

The high standards embodied in the Code of Conduct and the rules, regulations, and processes listed in this section of the Student Handbook have been developed through the cooperative efforts of students, faculty, and administrative officers. All members of our community agree to abide by and comply with each of these standards upon enrollment. Although the University enforces these standards through the student conduct processes described herein, it is the first and foremost responsibility of Fordham students to hold themselves and their fellow students to these clear and high standards. In this way, the Mission of the University is truly advanced.
