# Student Handbook: Advertisements in Student Publications

Student organizations, including student publications, exist to contribute to the overall mission of Fordham University and to advance the social, moral, cultural, intellectual, and/or spiritual development of its members and the community. It is the responsibility of the editors to work with advisors and the Office for Student Involvement on advertising that may be questionable.

Advertisements must be legal, truthful, and compatible with the values and mission of the University as a Jesuit, Catholic institution. These values include concern for each student, respect for individuals and groups of people and for the dignity of the human person.

To this end, the University prohibits the publication of ads containing or providing sources for, but not limited to, licentious sexual content (e.g. strip clubs, websites, etc.); alcohol consumption (e.g. bars, clubs, bartending schools, etc.); tobacco and other addictive substances; reproductive services (e.g. abortion, birth control, sperm or egg donation, etc.); the promotion of hate against any group; illegal activities; any other subject matter which, after discussion and review with University officials, is determined to be inconsistent with the values and mission of the University.
