# Student Handbook: Automobiles

Rules regarding the use of automobiles differ at the Rose Hill Campus and Lincoln Center Campus:

**Rose Hill**

To drive or park on the Rose Hill Campus, automobiles must be registered for the coming year. Vehicles must be registered with the Department of Public Safety prior to the start of the academic year. To register a vehicle on campus, you must apply online. The parking permit application, fees, and the Motor Vehicle Regulation Booklet, can be found under the “My Apps” tab, by scrolling down to “Utilities and Tools”. The registration fee is adjusted from year to year to reflect the cost of operating the University Parking Garage. Once you have applied, your university I.D. card, or EID, will be used to electronically access the parking garage. If you apply for the 24-hour parking option, you must pick up a 24-hour hang-tag from the Department of Public Safety Parking Office, which is located at the Thebaud Hall Annex.

All returning faculty, students, and staff must also re-apply online to reactivate your current parking privileges. However, this does not require a visit to the Department of Public Safety, unless you have selected the 24-hour parking or coupon book option. If you are an administrator, faculty, or employee the parking fee will be deducted from your paycheck. As a student, you will be billed through your bursar account for the parking fee. The 24-hour hang-tag must be displayed from your vehicle’s rear-view mirror or you will be subject to a Parking Violation Notice. All student vehicles must park on levels 1 through 4 in the university garage. Violators of parking regulations may be subject to having their vehicles booted or towed off campus at their expense.

Students use the University parking facilities at their own risk. Fordham University is not liable for personal injury, damage to vehicles, vandalism or theft of a motor vehicle or its contents. Further information can be obtained in the Department of Public Safety located in Thebaud Annex, or call 718-817-2222.
