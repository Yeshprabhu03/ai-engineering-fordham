# Student Handbook: Guests

Students are responsible for the actions of their guests and are expected to exercise careful judgment in selecting the guests they permit to come on campus or the nearby environs. Hosts are advised that conduct violations of guests (property damage or other) are treated as if the host committed the violation. This does not preclude direct action against any person through outside authorities. Please see the Office of Residential Life Handbook(s) for the more specific guest policies governing residence halls.
