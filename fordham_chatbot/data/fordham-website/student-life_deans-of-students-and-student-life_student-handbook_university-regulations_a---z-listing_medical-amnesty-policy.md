# Student Handbook: Medical Amnesty Policy

As a Catholic and Jesuit institution, Fordham University considers the safety and personal well-being of the student body a priority. The University recognizes that there may be alcohol or other drug-related medical or safety emergencies in which the potential for student conduct action could act as a deterrent to students who want to seek assistance for themselves or others. The Medical Amnesty Policy is designed to enable dangerously intoxicated or impaired students, or their guests, to receive the professional medical treatment they need.


When a student aids an intoxicated or impaired individual (including oneself) by contacting the Department of Public Safety or Residential Life staff for assistance, neither the intoxicated individual nor the individual or student reporting the emergency will be subject to formal student conduct action for the consumption or possession of alcohol or other drugs as a first offense. In rare circumstances such as cases where other violations occur, students will participate in the student conduct process. Examples include, but are not limited to, physical abuse, conduct which threatens safety, verbal or physical harassment, disorderly conduct or property damage. The Medical Amnesty Policy does not apply for subsequent alcohol or other drug intoxications or impairments.


**Intoxicated or impaired students**

who meet the criteria described above and are medically evaluated and/or hospitalized for alcohol or other drug use may receive Medical Amnesty and

1. will be required to have a follow up meeting with their Resident Director or a member of the Student Life staff. Following this meeting, the student will receive a letter that will describe the guidelines of this policy in more detail.


2. will be required to meet with staff in the Prevention and Support Program (Rose Hill) or the Alcohol and Other Drug Education Program (Lincoln Center).


3. will have their parents contacted by the University. In these cases, parental notification is not taken as a disciplinary action but as a precautionary measure.


4. may also be referred to Counseling and Psychological Services, University Health Services or an outside program for substance abuse evaluation and appropriate treatment.
