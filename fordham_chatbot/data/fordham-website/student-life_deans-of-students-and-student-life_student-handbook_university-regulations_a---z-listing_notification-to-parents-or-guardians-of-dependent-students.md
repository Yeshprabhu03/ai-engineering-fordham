# Student Handbook: Notification to Parents or Guardians of Dependent Students

If the student who is alleged to have violated the Code of Conduct is claimed as a dependent, the University reserves the right to inform his or her parents/guardians of the alleged violations, pending student conduct hearing, and subsequent student conduct decisions concerning the student. A student will be considered a dependent unless he or she establishes proof to the contrary to the Dean of Students.
