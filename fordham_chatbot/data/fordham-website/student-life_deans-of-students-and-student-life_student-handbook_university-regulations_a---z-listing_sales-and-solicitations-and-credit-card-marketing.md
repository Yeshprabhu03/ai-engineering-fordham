Offices and departments as well as recognized student clubs and organizations may reserve tables in specific locations inside as well as outside the Rev. Joseph M. McShane Campus Center and the Lowenstein Building for various reasons, including publicity, education, and sales and solicitation efforts approved under this policy by using the University’s reservation systems as noted in the University Regulation on the Campus Center.
