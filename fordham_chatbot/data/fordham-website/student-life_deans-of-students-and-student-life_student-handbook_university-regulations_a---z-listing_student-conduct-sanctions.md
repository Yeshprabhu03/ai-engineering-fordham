# Student Conduct Sanctions

When a student has been found responsible for violating a University rule under either the Student Code of Conduct Process or the Residence Halls Conduct Process, a sanction or combination of sanctions is imposed. Below is a description of the sanctions available to hearing officers. Clearly, the first two sanctions are to be considered the most serious because they refer to the permanent or temporary termination of a student's affiliation with the University.

**Expulsion from the University**

Permanent separation of the student from the University. The student will be barred from University premises. Any student who is expelled from the University is required to leave campus within the time specified by the Student Conduct Review Council or the Dean of Students (usually not more than 24 hours). When a decision involving suspension or expulsion from the University is appealed, a student may request to the Dean of Students for permission to leave only his or her belongings in the residence hall until the conclusion of the appeal.

**Suspension from the University**

Separation of the student from the University for a specified period of time. The student shall not participate in any University sponsored activity and may be barred from University premises. Suspended time will not count against time limits of the Graduate Schools for the completion of the degree. The penalty is given for a stated period of time before the student may request readmission. Conditions for readmission may be established at the time of suspension.

Any student who is suspended or expelled from the University is required to leave the campus and remove his or her belongings from the residence halls within 24 hours unless otherwise specified by the Dean of Students or the Student Conduct Review Council. When a decision involving suspension or expulsion from the University is appealed, a student may request to the Dean of Students for permission to leave only his or her belongings in the residence hall until the conclusion of the appeal.

**University Disciplinary Probation**The student may participate in student groups or organizations, but shall not represent the University in any extracurricular activity, shall not run for or hold office in any student group or organization, and/or shall not represent the University in any varsity or club sports. If deemed appropriate by the hearing officer, the student may also:

- Be further barred from all extracurricular activities.
- Be barred from areas on campus where alcohol is served.
- Be allowed on college property only to the extent that his or her class schedule and his or her residence on campus requires.
- Be suspended or dismissed from the Residence Hall. In this case, the student is required to remove herself/himself and all her/his belongings from the residence hall/housing area. The dismissed student shall not reside, visit, or attend social functions in any of the University residence hall/housing area, both on and off campus. This sanction may be either temporary or permanent to be specified by the hearing officer at the time of sanctioning.
- Any student who is suspended or dismissed from residence is required to leave the halls and remove her/his belongings within 24 hours unless otherwise specified by the hearing officer or Dean of Students.

Additional restrictions or conditions may also be imposed. Further, modifications to the standard restrictions of disciplinary probation may be made on a case by case basis and only for extenuating circumstances. Such exceptions must be reviewed and approved by the Dean of Students.

Violation of any of the terms of disciplinary probation subjects a student to immediate suspension or expulsion from the University.

**Group Probation**

An organization is denied the opportunity to operate on campus for a stated period of time. Registered organizations that are placed on probation may also be subject to restricted funding and/or office space during the stated time period of probation.

**Residential Life Probation**

The resident student is warned that future violations of the residence hall regulations or University Code of Conduct will result in dismissal from the residence halls. Residents on probation at the time of the housing lottery will automatically be placed in overflow housing unless notified that this condition of Residential Life Probation is waived by the hearing officer.

**Student Life Probation**

The commuting student is warned that future violations of the University Code of Conduct or residence hall regulations on- or off-campus may result in further and more serious sanctions, including University Disciplinary Probation (see above).

**Suspension or Dismissal from the Residence Hall**

The student shall not reside in or visit any of the residence halls, both on and off campus, on either a temporary or permanent basis. Additionally, the student may not attend any Residential Life, including Residence Halls Association, social events anywhere on or off campus. The student is required to leave the halls with his or her belongings within 24 hours unless otherwise specified.

**Reprimand**

The student is warned that further misconduct may result in more severe sanctions.

**Restitution**

The student is required to make payment to the University or to other persons, groups, or organizations for damages incurred as a result of violating the Code of Conduct.

**Other Sanctions**

Other sanctions may be imposed instead of or in addition to those specified in the sections above. For example, students may be subject to restrictions upon or denials of driving privileges for conduct violations involving the use or registration of motor vehicles. Work or research projects may also be assigned.
