# Student Handbook: Withdrawal by the University

Under limited circumstances, the University reserves the right to withdraw a student whose physical, mental, or emotional health becomes a detriment to the student's continued ability to reside in University housing or to successful completion of academic requirements, or whenever the student fails to undertake measures necessary and recommended for the student's own personal health and safety.
