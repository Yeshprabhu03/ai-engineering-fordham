# Drug-Free Campus Guidelines: Policy Statement

The United States Department of Education has issued regulations for the implementation of the provisions of the “Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989” (Public Law 101-226). These regulations require the University to distribute annually to each student and employee information regarding the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol by students and employees on University property or as part of its on-campus or off-campus activities.

Fordham University’s standards of conduct with respect to alcohol and drug abuse are described herein, along with the health risks associated with substance abuse. We have also attempted to outline the various assistance programs available at the University and other places in the New York City and Westchester areas where individuals can seek help and treatment.

These guidelines are reviewed by Fordham University on an annual basis to determine the effectiveness of the program and consistency of sanction enforcement, in order to identify and implement any necessary changes.
