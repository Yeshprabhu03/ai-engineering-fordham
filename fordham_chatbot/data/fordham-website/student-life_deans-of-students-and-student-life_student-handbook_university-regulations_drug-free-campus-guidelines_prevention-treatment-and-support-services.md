These areas provide individual and group interventions and educational programs to students who violate the University’s published policies on alcohol and other drugs, as well as to students concerned about alcohol or other drug-related issues. Additionally, some students participate in educational sanctions about the effects and consequences related to alcohol and other drug use. Members of the University community can contact either campus program for referrals to off-campus treatment facilities and/or support groups.

To educate the larger campus community, these programs also facilitate trainings and presentations during Fall Orientation, First-Year Student Core Programming and at various student leader and staff trainings on each campus. For more information on these services, visit:
