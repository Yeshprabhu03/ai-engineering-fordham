# Ram Van: Airport Shuttle Service

The Department of University Transportation provides transportation between the Rose Hill campus and LaGuardia, JFK, and Newark International airports.

This service is offered only before the University's holidays. Passengers that purchase tickets for this service before the reservation deadlines are guaranteed to have a van scheduled to fit the timing of their flight and desired arrival at the airport.

**Notice to Residents of Lincoln Center**

All members of the Fordham Community are welcome to take the service. *However, all scheduled departures to the airport will be made from Rose Hill*. A free Ram Van ride will be provided to Lincoln Center students utilizing the airport service who need to be at Rose Hill for the van's departure. Passengers are responsible for paying for their fare to Rose Hill for the airport van's departure if they use means of transportation (subway, Metro-North, ride-sharing apps, taxis, etc.) other than the Ram Van service. However, if you are a Lincoln Center student, you have the option to charter a van that will depart from the Lincoln Center Campus. Please get in touch with us regarding rates.
