# About Ram Van

The Ram Van has provided safe, affordable, and reliable transportation between the Rose Hill and Lincoln Center campuses since 1981.

The Ram Van relies heavily on the 130+ student workers who drive, dispatch, fuel, and coordinate maintenance of our 50+ vehicle fleet. All student-workers are trained extensively on driving safety and emergency protocol.

Ram Vans seat 14 passengers and are customized for the safety and comfort of our passengers. This year, we will transport over 250,000 passengers between campuses safely and efficiently.
