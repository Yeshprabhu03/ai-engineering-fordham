- Testing accommodations
- Classroom accommodations
- Graduate assistantships and/or internships for credit

Accommodations **must be requested** at the beginning of each semester by submitting an accommodations request through our online system, AIM, and submitting it to the office. You will be given this online access information at your intake appointment.

It is the student’s responsibility to contact the office in regards to accommodations in the semester he or she requires services. Requests for accommodations should be made to the Office of Disability Services at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#72161b0113101b1e1b060b011700041b11170132141d00161a131f5c171607).

## Academic Accommodations

While Fordham University will consider making academic accommodations in appropriate circumstances, no academic accommodations will be granted that fundamentally alter the nature of the course or program, or which unduly burden the University financially or administratively.

Some examples of accommodations Fordham has provided to students include, but are not limited to:

- Reduced course loads
- Extending the amount of time to complete the requirements for graduation. Typically, this accommodation is only considered for undergraduate programs if the delay will not fundamentally alter the nature of the program or degree.
- Providing limited extensions of time for completing assignments, and similar accommodations

## Academic Support Services

Disability Services offers Academic Support Services for those who need additional assistance during classroom time.

These services include access to:

- Proctoring of Exams
- Extended test-taking time
- Use of books in alternative formats
- Transcription
- Classroom accessibility assistance

**Please note:** Based on the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) law, The Office of Disability Services does not grant accommodations retroactively. If new accommodations are needed, you must meet with ODS to discuss adjusting your accommodation plan and may potentially need to provide updated documentation accordingly.

**For those students with a documented disability who have been approved for a single room as an accommodation, the single room housing rates will be set at the double room rate in the assigned residence hall.
