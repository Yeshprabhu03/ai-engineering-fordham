# Office of Disability Services: Information for Faculty

Faculty Resource Guide

In order for faculty to better assist students with disabilities, ODS has created an Online Faculty Training Program.

The Office of Disability Services and the Office of Information Technology are pleased to announce the availability of **SensusAccess**, an automated document conversion service for creating alternate media. The tool is especially useful for those who need a particular format for screenreaders and other accessible technology tools.

To access the service, simply:

- Log into the
[fordham.edu](http://fordham.edu/)portal - Go to My Apps
- Click on the “Document Conversion Tool” link
- Follow the upload instructions

The converted file will be emailed to you thereafter. SensusAccess converts readings, slides, and lecture notes into an alternative format, including .doc, PDF, MP3, ebooks, digital Braille, and more.

Using optical character recognition (OCR), SensusAccess can also convert scanned PDF documents, images of text captured with a smartphone, and PowerPoint into alternative formats. Keep in mind that the quality of SensusAccess’ output is based on the quality of the original item put into it.

A document scanned from a poor photocopy, or a document containing heavy underlining and margin notes, may not result in a fully legible file. For more information, here’s a video overview of the service:
