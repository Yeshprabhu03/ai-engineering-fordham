# Information for Parents and Guardians

The Office of Disability Services (ODS) appreciates that parents/caregivers of students with disabilities are routinely an active role in the student’s education by working with the student's high school to facilitate classroom accommodations. However, at the college level the service model changes significantly.

At Fordham, students are viewed as adults, and must self-identify as having a disability in order to register and receive accommodations with ODS. Self-advocacy is an important tool for the student at Fordham and beyond. We at ODS ask that you help encourage your child to register with ODS and use their accommodations.

Please review the other information on our website, and feel free to [contact us](/student-life/disability-services/contact-us/) with any questions or concerns.

***Please note that virtual accommodations are not available through ODS for disabilities of any sort.**

**Differences Between High School and College: Understanding Your Rights and Responsibilities**

Transitioning from high school to college comes with significant changes, especially for students with disabilities. One of the most important shifts is in how disability rights and accommodations are handled.
