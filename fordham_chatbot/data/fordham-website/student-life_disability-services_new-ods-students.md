### Documentation Guidelines

In order to receive accommodations for a disability in class or for a graduate assistantship or internship for credit, you must first meet with a staff member at ODS for your initial intake meeting, at which you should bring any documentation you have of your disability.

Documentation that is needed may vary based on the nature of the disability.

**Psychological**Documentation must be in the form of a letter from the person diagnosing the psychological condition. It should include the formal diagnosis, the onset of the condition, and its impact on you. The documentation must be on official letterhead and include the mental health professional’s signature and license number. It also needs to be dated within the last 6 months.

**Learning Disability/ADHD**Documentation should be in the form of a neuropsychological report or a high school IEP plan based on LD or ADHD, and it must be dated within the last 4 years. An updated letter from your doctor might be accepted as a supplement to an out-of-date report, but this will be determined on a case-by-case basis.

*ODS will accept a 504 Plan only for the most basic accommodations, such as 1.5× extended time.

**Physical/Medical** (chronic illness, visual impairment, hearing, mobility, etc.)

Documentation should be in the form of a letter from your doctor explaining your medical condition and how it impacts you. It needs to be on official letterhead and include the medical professional’s signature and license number. The documentation must be dated within the last 6 months. Any tests/results are also helpful.

ODS is able to provide accommodations for temporary conditions such as concussions or a broken hand/wrist/arm. Please note students will need to provide updated documentation from their provider every two weeks.
