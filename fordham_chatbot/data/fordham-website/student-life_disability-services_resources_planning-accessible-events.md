# Planning Accessible Events

When planning special programs or events the Americans with Disabilities Act mandates that "reasonable accommodations" be provided to allow qualified individuals with disabilities to participate fully in University programs.

If you are a current student with a physical mobility disability or hearing impairment and require a change of venue for an event on campus or special accommodations in order to attend an event, please contact us at 718-817-0655** **or via email at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f2969b8193909b9e9b868b819780849b919781b2949d80969a939fdc979687).

Please notify us at least 1-2 weeks before your event to allow for adequate time to coordinate with other departments to ensure that you are able to fully participate in the planned event.

If you are unable to allow a 1-2 weeks' notice, please contact us and we will do our best to make arrangements.
