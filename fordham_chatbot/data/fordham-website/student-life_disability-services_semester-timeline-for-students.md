# Semester Timeline for Students

This timeline outlines our suggestions on how to navigate your accommodations in a timely manner with your professors:


**Start of classes through first week of school:** Log into [AIM](https://www.fordham.edu/student-life/disability-services/aim-instructions/) to request your accommodations

**Weeks 1-2:** Follow up with your professors to ensure they have received the accommodation letter, and understand the accommodations. It is mandatory that you print your your accommodation letter and speak to your professors.

**Weeks 3-4:** If you receive testing accommodations, make sure your professors have filed out the testing contract for each class.

**Weeks 5-8:** Make sure to request testing for midterms if you wish to use your accommodations for them.

**Weeks 12-15**: Make sure to request testing for finals if you wish to use your accommodations for them.


Throughout the Term: Please put in any testing requests you wish to take using your accommodations. Reach out to ODS if you have any questions or concerns. Please review all policies and procedures listed below.


**ODS Policies and Procedures**

- I am responsible for requesting my accommodations through AIM (online system) each semester during the first 2 weeks of class. It does not occur automatically. Please note that you will not have access to request your letters until one week prior to the start of each semester
- I understand ODS will approve requests for accommodations within 24 hours, unless the request is placed over the weekend or on a day that the University is closed.
- Although ODS is providing my accommodation letters electronically, I am responsible for bringing a copy of the letter to my professors in a timely manner and discussing my accommodations to make sure all parties are clear on what is needed. If I do not do this, I will not receive the accommodations.
- If a faculty member does not use a Fordham email address, I will inform ODS immediately so it can be changed in AIM.
- The ADA does not allow faculty members to retroactively provide accommodations for students.
- I am responsible for informing ODS of any accommodations' issues from faculty ASAP.
- I am responsible for informing ODS and setting up a meeting if I would like to adjust my accommodations.
- At this moment, I am in complete understanding of the policies and procedures necessary to obtain accommodations from Fordham University’s Office of Disability Services and will contact ODS immediately if I become unclear about any processes or procedures immediately.

**ODS Testing Policies & Procedures**

The following policies and procedures have been developed to help students avoid misunderstandings related to academic integrity. If your specific needs conflict with one of these expectations, please discuss that with ODS in advance of your first exam in ODS:

- I understand I must sign up for exams I want to take in ODS at least 3 business days ahead of time. Final exams must be submitted 5 business days ahead of time. (Business days do not include weekends or when the University is officially closed.)
- If taking a night class, I will speak to ODS directly and sign up for testing at least 5 business days prior.
- To sign up for an exam, I understand the professor must first fill out the testing contract. This can only be done after I put in my accommodation requests, and ODS approves them.
- If my professor has not filled out the testing contract, I must remind him/her in a timely fashion. If still not done, I will contact ODS to intervene at least one week ahead of time.
- I am the only person who can sign up to take the exam. Even if I tell the professor I plan on taking it in ODS, and s/he sends it to ODS, I am not guaranteed a spot unless I have signed up through AIM.
- I will always take my exam at the same date/time as the rest of the class. Exceptions need ODS and professor approval and must be sent, in writing to
[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)* Students who have a valid reason will be granted an exception upon review. - If I am unwell and cannot take the exam, I will contact both my professor and ODS. ODS requires an excused absence through the advisor/Dean’s office.
- If the change of exam date/time is not approved by ODS, but is approved by the professor, the professor and I need to make testing arrangements.
- If I receive a rescheduling notice and do not address it in order to get my request approved, I must take the exam in the class without accommodations.
- I understand that late arrival for exams will result in an automatic time reduction corresponding to the number of minutes I am late. If I do arrive late, I will adhere to the already scheduled exam end time. Any exceptions will be determined on a case by case basis.
- I understand ODS is a confidential office, and I cannot arrive at the office more than 10 minutes prior to the start of my exam.
- I understand I will be monitored by a proctor and video surveillance.
- Breaks to use the restroom will not be permitted until 2 hours into your exam time. Any exceptions will be determined on a case by case basis.
- I will hand over any and all electronic devices to the proctor and turn them completely off, along with any watches or bulky pieces of jewelry.
- I will leave my bag, hat, jacket, or any extra clothing outside of the testing room, and I will not wear anything that is extremely baggy or with many pockets.
- I will bring my own pens and pencils.
- The exam needs to take place on the same campus the class is on.
- Food and drink are not allowed in the testing room, besides a clear water bottle with no labels or writing. Any exceptions will be determined on a case by case basis.
- I will keep all test materials on top of the desk/table.
- If I am allowed to use materials, ODS will make sure they are verified in the testing contract, or separately by the Professor prior to the start of the exam.
- I will Always inform the proctor if I need to leave the testing area.
- If I do not follow the policies and procedures there is no guarantee my exam will be approved.
- Any exceptions will be determined on a case by case basis.

If I am unclear about testing policies during the semester, I will contact ODS

immediately.

**Academic Integrity Statement**

“As a student of Fordham University, I recognize that I am part of a community dedicated to the disciplined and rigorous pursuit of knowledge and communication of truth. I therefore commit myself to the University Code of Conduct and upholding the highest standards of academic integrity. Any work that I claim to be my own will be my own; I will give appropriate credit where credit is due; I will be fair and honest in all of my interactions with members of the Fordham community.”

If you are suspected of cheating, you will be asked to step outside of the testing room with all of your exam materials. ODS staff will share with you the reason for the suspicion and you will be asked to show ODS staff that you don’t have anything in your pockets, on your person, or attached to your exam that could assist you with your exam.

- If you refuse to comply, you will not be allowed to continue your exam. ODS will then contact your professor to inform him or her of the situation. Whether or not you will have the opportunity to complete your exam will be solely at the discretion of your professor.
- If there is a clear breach of academic integrity, you will not be allowed to continue your exam. ODS will collect unauthorized materials and/or devices used to assist you with your exam and contact your professor to inform him or her of the situation. Whether or not you will have the opportunity to complete your exam will be solely at the discretion of your professor. Please see the
[Academic Integrity Policy website](https://www.fordham.edu/resources/policies/academic-integrity-policy/)for complete details about a report of an alleged academic integrity violation.. - If you are able to show prove that there has not been a breach of academic integrity, you will be allowed to return to the exam room to continue your exam. Any time that was lost while speaking with ODS staff will be awarded back to you.

I have read and understood the statement of academic integrity. If I am unclear about testing academic integrity during the semester, I will contact ODS immediately.
