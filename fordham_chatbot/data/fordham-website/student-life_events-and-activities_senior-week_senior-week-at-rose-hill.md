# Senior Week at Rose Hill

The Senior Week Committee and the Office for Student Involvement are proud to sponsor the Senior Week events for Fordham College at Rose Hill and Gabelli School of Business seniors.

## Senior Week Committee 2026

Isabella Valentino, Co-Chair

Abigail Cristofaro, Co-Chair

AJ Coppotelli, Senior Associate Director for Student Formation

The Senior Week Committee could not achieve all that they do without the help of excellent volunteers. The committee recruits 30-35 underclassmen each year to help with event duties and assist the committee in reaching its goals.
