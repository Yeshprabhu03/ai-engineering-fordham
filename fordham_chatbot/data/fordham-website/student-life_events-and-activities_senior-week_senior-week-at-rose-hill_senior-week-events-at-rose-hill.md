### Tickets

Only graduating seniors of Fordham College at Rose Hill and the Gabelli School of Business at Rose Hill are eligible to purchase tickets to Rose Hill Senior Week events. This means you must log in to University Tickets with your Fordham student credentials (email, password). No one else can purchase tickets for you under any other email account. Tickets to Senior Week events must be purchased in advance via [University Tickets](https://fordham.universitytickets.com/). At this time, the ticket release date is still being determined. Tickets are non-refundable and non-transferable. Tickets will not be sold at the door of any Senior Week event. Students must present their current Fordham ID, a valid proof of age (passport, driver’s license, or military identification card), and, if required, an admission ticket at each Senior Week event.

Tickets are required for admission to all events. Tickets for most events are limited to one per person. Up to four tickets (including yourself) may be purchased for the Parent Appreciation Dinner Dance on a first-come, first-served basis. As communicated earlier to seniors, space is limited and tickets will sell out. Please also note there will be additional service fees when purchasing your tickets.

Please review the Senior Week website for up-to-date information.

Seating Requests for Parent Appreciation Dinner Dance

Please email the Senior Week Committee at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) should changes need to be made regarding your seats or tickets. Seating requests are not guaranteed. Seating adjustments will not be honored if the committee is not notified regarding ticketing changes. Review the Rose Hill Senior Week website for the most up-to-date information regarding ticket sales and seating request timelines and information.

### Alcohol

As with every University-sponsored event, no person under the age of 21 may possess, consume, or be in the presence of alcohol except in officially designated spaces. Although alcohol will be available for purchase for students over the age of 21 during select Senior Week events, students are prohibited from bringing alcohol – or other outside food or beverages – to any event. If a student arrives at an event intoxicated, he or she will not be granted admission and will not receive a refund for his or her ticket. Any student who is observed to be intoxicated may be found in violation of the University’s alcohol policy. Conduct resulting from the consumption of alcohol that is in any way illegal or in violation of any other policy is also prohibited.

*Please behave responsibly and be sure to make travel arrangements to and from all Senior Week events ahead of time. No outside food or beverages will be permitted within the event locations.*
