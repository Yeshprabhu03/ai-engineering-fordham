# First-Year Formation

## What is FYF?

The First-Year Formation (FYF) program is a symposium designed to assist students with the adjustment and transition to college life at Fordham University, the Jesuit University of New York.

Sponsored by New Student Orientation and the Office for Student Involvement, First-Year Formation is an extension of the summer and fall orientation programs. The program promotes student involvement in the Fordham academic and co-curricular community, and explores the University’s distinct Jesuit mission by engaging new students from their very first days on campus. The symposium meets weekly during the fall semester, and features modules that promote academic and career success, exploration of personal values, ethical decision-making and service in its many dimensions.

The symposium consists of a small group of new students, and is taught by a Student Affairs administrator with the help of an upperclass student orientation leader who knows what it is like to be a Fordham University at Lincoln Center student. The course is taught using a variety of teaching techniques including discussion, and weekly reflections, to help a small group of first-year students make the most out of their college experience.
