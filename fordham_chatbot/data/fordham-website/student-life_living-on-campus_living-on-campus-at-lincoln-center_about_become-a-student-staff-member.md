**What is the difference between the Resident Assistant (RA) and a Resident First-Year Mentor (RFM) position?**

RAs and RFMs are student staff members who are responsible for fostering an inclusive community and ensuring the physical and emotional well-being of residents living within either McKeon or McMahon Halls at Fordham University’s Lincoln Center campus. Under the direct supervision of a Resident Director (RD), they oversee and provide guidance to students living on campus and are responsible for assisting in the day-to-day management of the residence halls. While serving as a representative of the Office of Residential Life (ORL) and Fordham University, they uphold the standards of the Office and the University and promote our Jesuit-Catholic mission through community development and student learning initiatives, incident response, on-duty coverage (RAs only), role modeling and leadership, and administrative/staff functions. RAs are required to participate in on-duty coverage during holiday breaks and university recesses (not including summer). RFMs do not participate in the duty rotation.

**Compensation**

- RAs are provided with a meal plan (McKeon) or meal check (McMahon) and a single room, both paid in full for the academic year. RAs also received a taxed stipend per semester.
- RFMs are provided with a meal plan (McKeon) or a meal check (McMahon), paid in full for the academic year, and a single bedroom, paid for one semester. RFMs also received a taxed stipend per semester.

**How will my financial aid be affected?**

Because remuneration comes in the form of a grant, there are a number of factors that may affect an applicant’s financial aid package. The Office of Residential Life highly encourages all applicants to speak with a representative in the Financial Aid Office (LL 214) to discuss how position compensation may affect them prior to applying for a position. By accepting a position, all student staff members acknowledge that they are aware of how the position may affect their financial aid.
