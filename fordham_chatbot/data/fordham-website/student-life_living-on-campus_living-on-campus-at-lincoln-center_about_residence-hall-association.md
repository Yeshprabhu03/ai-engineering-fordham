# Lincoln Center Residence Hall Association

The Residence Hall Association (RHA) is one of the three governing bodies at the Fordham University at Lincoln Center campus. RHA represents the interests of students living on-campus. Its mission is to promote residential students’ general welfare by providing opportunities for educational and social growth, democratic engagement, and scholastic achievement.

**Purpose**

RHA will provide an outlet for residential students to raise concerns about issues happening within the residence halls and will serve as the residential student voice, advocating for their needs and desires within the Office of Residential Life, the United Student Government, and the wider campus community. RHA also serves as a liaison between residential students, the Office of Residential Life, and Lincoln Center administration. Additionally, RHA hosts large-scale social events to strengthen community on-campus. All residential students are encouraged to help plan these events by joining RHA programming committees.

**Structure**

RHA includes an executive board and a general body. The executive board consists of a president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer, advocacy coordinator, and two programming coordinators. While all residential students are members of the general body, RHA elects residents from each academic class to propose policy changes and advocate on behalf of all residential students. RHA holds executive board elections at end of the spring semester and class representative elections at the start of the fall semester.

**Get Involved**

Residents who would like to voice concerns about the residential community or learn more about how to get involved in planning large-scale events are encouraged to attend general body meetings on Tuesdays at 7 p.m. in McMahon 109stop by the RHA office in McMahon 102A, or send an email to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fa88929b9699ba9c95889e929b97d49f9e8f).
