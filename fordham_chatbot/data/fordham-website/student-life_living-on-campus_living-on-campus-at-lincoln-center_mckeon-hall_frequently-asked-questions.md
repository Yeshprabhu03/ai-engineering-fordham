Aside from the bathroom vanity, there are no other mirrors in the room.


**Toiletries**

All residents are required to bring their own toiletries, including toilet paper


**Cleaning**

One aspect of learning how to live independently is the cleaning and maintaining your own space. All McKeon Hall residents are responsible for maintaining the cleanliness of their room and bathroom. Residents must bring their own cleaning products and make plans to clean these spaces. It is highly recommended that residents also bring a toilet plunger and toilet bowl cleaner and learn how to use these items prior to moving in.


McMahon Hall residents are able to borrow vacuum cleaners from ORL. In McKeon, all rooms have linoleum flooring. The ORL recommends that McKeon Hall residents bring a microfiber dust mop to clean their bedroom floor.


**Cable and Internet**

While there is Wi-Fi available throughout the building, rooms have wall outlets for cable and Ethernet. Outlet locations vary in each room. Coaxial cables and Ethernet cables are not provided. Coaxial cable and Ethernet cable lengths would vary based on where you plan to put your TV and laptop within your room. The ORL recommends that you wait until you have moved in to purchase these items so that you can purchase the appropriate length. There is a Best Buy and Bed, Bath, and Beyond within one block of campus.


**Electrical outlets**

Outlet locations in each room vary. There are 2-3 wall plates in each room with two outlets per plate. If you bring extension cords, you must bring heavy-duty, grounded, cords. All power strips MUST have surge protectors/suppressors.


**Lighting**

There is one overhead light in the room's entryway and one to two wall-mounted lights inside each room. You may bring additional lighting (desk lamps, floor lamps, etc.). The bathroom features a wall-mounted light above the mirror and an overhead light that runs on a motion sensor.


**Community Kitchen**

There is a full kitchen located on the 22nd floor. The kitchen includes a stove/oven, microwave, dishwasher, and refrigerator. There are a limited number of basic cooking supplies (pots and pans) available for checkout from the Resident Assistant on Duty office. Residents are responsible for cleaning and maintaining this communal space. While residents may utilize the refrigerator and freezer, they do so at their own risk. The ORL is not responsible for lost or stolen items left in the communal kitchen.
