Students must decide with whom they want to live with for next year.

Based on the number of potential roommates, the roommates should discuss what type of apartment they are interested in living in for next year.

Groups of 3 must select a 3-person apartment (an apartment with 3 single rooms)

Groups of 4 must select a 4-person apartment (an apartment with 2 double rooms or an apartment with 1 double room and 2 single rooms)

Groups of 6 must select a 6-person apartment (an apartment with 3 double rooms)

Room selection groups must have enough people to fill the ENTIRE apartment. If you would like to select a 6 person apartment, for example, you MUST have 6 people in your room selection group.

Once this is decided, students must assign one person in their group to be their group leader. The group leader will have a lot of responsibility through the room selection process (see Role of Group Leader section). THE GROUP LEADER SHOULD ALSO BE THE PERSON WITH THE BEST TIMESLOT.

Students should discuss a backup plan in case they are unable to obtain their first choice of apartment and be prepared to select a different apartment choice OR regroup into smaller or larger groups based on what housing options are left for them to choose.

Example: A group of 3 students trying to obtain a 3-person apartment should be prepared to add a fourth roommate if there are no longer any 3-person apartments available. By adding an additional person, this group can select a 4-person apartment.

Example: A group of 4 students trying to obtain a 4-person apartment should be prepared to add 2 additional roommates if there are no longer any 4-person apartments available. By adding two additional people, this group can select a 6-person apartment.
