# Withdrawal from Housing at Lincoln Center

Please review the following for the process to withdraw from housing:

- The 2025-2026 Housing Agreement is for the academic year. If you are planning to study abroad, transfer, graduate early, or take a leave of absence, you must submit the
[Housing Withdrawal Form for Spring 2026](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSehkhxA2459CIDZcL6eZ9ZefiHpPvCHORj0eE2nG_5qX0JWbQ/viewform?embedded=true). - You must follow instructions from Residential Life staff to fully move out of your residence hall and return your key in the proper format.
- Per the housing agreement, you will be responsible for the full academic year cost of housing unless you are graduating, studying abroad, or transferring after the fall semester. There may be exceptions to excruciating circumstances, which is determined by the Director of Residential Life and the Dean of Students.
- For those studying abroad, transferring, or graduating, if the housing application is withdrawn after December 23 but prior to the start of the spring semester of occupancy, the Student will incur a $1000 late withdrawal charge.
