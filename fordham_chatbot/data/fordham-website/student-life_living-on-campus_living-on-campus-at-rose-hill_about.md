# About Living on Campus at Rose Hill

Students should expect to enter a community where what one learns inside the classroom is used in daily life outside the classroom. Our [residence halls](/student-life/living-on-campus/living-on-campus-at-rose-hill/residence-halls/) are our students' homes from August to May and, as such, are places where participation in the community is expected and rewarded.

The rights and responsibilities described in the vision statement below offer a glimpse into what life should be like in the residence halls of Fordham University, an independent Catholic institution in the Jesuit tradition.

The campus, far from merely a place to sleep, eat, and socialize, is a giant virtual classroom where one's daily life is preparation for career, citizenship, service, and devotion after graduation. The job of all of us who work in [The Office of Residential Life at Rose Hill](/student-life/living-on-campus/living-on-campus-at-rose-hill/about/contact-us/) is to assist in providing this kind of education.
