# Integrated Learning Community for Global Business

The Integrated Learning Community for Global Business strives to provide a co-curricular learning experience, offer ethical and informed business preparation and enhance one’s cultural intelligence through substantitive participation within an engaged community. This community will also integrate academic excellence, residential activities and service to develop international business skills.


The Integrated Learning Community for Global Business is located on the 3rd floor of O’Hare Hall Residential College and is available to Sophomore students.


All residents will be enrolled in two GABELLI courses (one each semester) on the floor where they live. Residents will also be required to attend lectures by business executives and attend field visits to major firms in Manhattan. It is not a requirement to be a business major to apply for The Integrated Learning Community for Global Business; however, we strongly encourage applicants to have a specific interest in business and willingness to participate in the programmatic efforts.


Efforts for this Integrated Learning Community are coordinated by:
