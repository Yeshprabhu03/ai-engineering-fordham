# Rose Hill Campus: Loyola Hall Residential College

![Loyola Hall](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/loyolahall.jpg)

The newly renovated [Loyola Hall Residential College](http://youvis.it/pypDqw) is home to approximately 125 first-year students in the Manresa Scholars Program. The recently renovated residence hall houses two classroom spaces that are equipped with Smart technology, a kitchen, student nooks, and a small chapel.

## Manresa Scholars Program at Loyola Hall

In the tradition of the Manresa Program, students, staff, and faculty share the common project of deciding how the members of Loyola Hall spend the coming year living and learning together and work collaboratively to make this project a success. Students choosing to live in Loyola also choose to be Manresa scholars and enroll in a seminar taught by one of Fordham’s internationally renowned teacher-scholars.

Each professor also serves as an academic adviser and mentor to the students. Manresa scholars live and study together in this residential college setting, where they participate in activities that nurture the development of the whole person—mind, body, and spirit—within a community of students and teachers.

## The Residence Hall Staff

The staff consists of one resident director, four undergraduate resident assistants, and one faculty-in-residence. In addition, staff will work with the Manresa seminar faculty, internationally renowned teacher-scholars from Fordham College at Rose Hill, and a Ground Floor course instructor from the Gabelli School of Business. Together, staff and faculty will work diligently to expand each resident’s intellectual, spiritual, social, and cultural growth within the residential setting, thus complementing the academic experience.
