# Rose Hill Campus: Martyrs' Court

![Martyrs Court](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/martyrs_court.jpg)

This complex is composed of three sections named after the 17th-century Jesuit Martyrs of North America: Saint Isaac Jogues, Saint John LaLande, and Saint Rene Goupil. Martyrs’ Court is divided into two residence halls: [Martyrs’ Court: LaLande/Goupil](/student-life/living-on-campus/living-on-campus-at-rose-hill/residence-halls/first-year-student-housing/martyrs-court/lalande-and-goupil-halls/) and [Martyrs’ Court: Jogues](/student-life/living-on-campus/living-on-campus-at-rose-hill/residence-halls/first-year-student-housing/martyrs-court/jogues-hall-science-community/). The halls house primarily first-year students in double and triple rooms. Select singles are reserved for upperclassmen.

[Martyrs’ Court](http://youvis.it/q1hslb) is located on the west-end of the campus and overlooks Martyrs’ Lawn, one of the many green spaces on Fordham University’s Rose Hill campus.
