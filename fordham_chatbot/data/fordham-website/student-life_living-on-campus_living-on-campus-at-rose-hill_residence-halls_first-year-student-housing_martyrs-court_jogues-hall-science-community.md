This residential opportunity for first-year students enrolled in science courses has been created in conjunction with the associate dean for science education and director of pre-health professions advising. Faculty and other speakers will be invited regularly to participate in planned activities. Upperclass students live in the community as tutors for the first-year students. Many resident assistants will be upper-class science majors who understand the rigors of the demanding and rewarding majors.

If you are interested in living in this community, please indicate your preference on the online [Housing Application](/student-life/living-on-campus/applying-for-housing/). You must enroll in science courses to be a SILC resident.
