# Tierney Hall

The Residential College at Tierney Hall is home to 150 students, including upperclass students and new students. Members of this small community will work closely with six resident assistants, a resident director, a master, Mission and Ministry staff, and staff from [Fordham College at Rose Hill](/academics/colleges-and-schools/undergraduate-schools/) and the [Gabelli School of Business](/gabelli-school-of-business/) to create an intentional experience that focuses on the specific needs of the community. Renovated in 2007, Tierney Hall has a large community kitchen, smart technology lounges, and study nooks throughout the building. Residents will live in double, triple, or quad occupancy rooms (all at standard rates) with air conditioning and common bathrooms.

Students will have the opportunity to be actively involved in programs and activities within the community.
