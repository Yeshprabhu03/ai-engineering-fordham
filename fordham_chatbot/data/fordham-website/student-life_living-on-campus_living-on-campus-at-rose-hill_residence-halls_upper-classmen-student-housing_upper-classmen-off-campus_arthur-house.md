## Independence with On-Campus Benefits

Arthur House residents enjoy furnished apartments in University-operated buildings. Off-campus houses are staffed by a Resident Director and Resident Assistants and are maintained by the University. The Belmont Community Housing program offers similar services and benefits as those offered within the on-campus housing program, coupled with the independence of off-campus living.

Arthur House accommodates seven students in each of the eight apartments. Each apartment has a combination of single and double bedrooms, a living/dining area, kitchen, and full bathrooms
