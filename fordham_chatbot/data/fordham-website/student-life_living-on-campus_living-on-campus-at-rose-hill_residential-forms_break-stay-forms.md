# Break-Stay Forms

In order to stay on campus during any of the major breaks, students must fill out a Break-Stay form. However, several residence halls are not open for all of the breaks. Additionally, Break-Stay is only available for limited circumstances for some of the breaks.

Thus, it is imperative for students to confirm hall openings and closings for each break, determine their eligibility, and fill out the appropriate Break-Stay form by the required deadline. To the left, you will find links to all of our Break-Stay forms.
