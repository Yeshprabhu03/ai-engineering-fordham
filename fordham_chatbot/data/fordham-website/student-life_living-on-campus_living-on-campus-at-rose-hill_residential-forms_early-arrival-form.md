# Early Arrival Form

Students living at the Rose Hill Campus should only use this form that will be updates in Summer 2025 if they wish to move into their assigned residence hall room early. A fee is associated with Early Arrival, and not all students will be able to be accommodated early.

Official Rose Hill Campus move-in dates are as follows:

**New International Resident Students:**August 20, 2025- This only applies to International Resident Students participating in Global Transition

**Graduate Resident Students:**One Day Prior to Academic Orientation**New Domestic First Year & Transfer Resident Students:**Sunday, August 24, 2025**Upperclassmen Resident Students:**Monday, August 25 through Tuesday, August 26, 2025

Unless you are approved for Early Arrival, you are not permitted to move in earlier than your applicable Opening Day.

### Early Arrival for Personal Reasons:

If you wish to move into your Fall 2025 assignment for personal reasons before the above outlined dates, you will need to submit an Early Arrival request through the Google Form. Please note that the submission of this form does not guarantee approval for early arrival. The Office of Residential Life at Rose Hill reserves the right to deny a request for any reason.

Early arrival approval is granted strictly via e-mail correspondence with the Office of Residential Life at Rose Hill. If approved, you will receive a confirmed move in date/time via e-mail and subsequent billing charges directly to your bursar's account. **There is a non-negotiable charge of $40.00 per day for each day your housing assignment is occupied prior to Opening Day.** This charge will be posted to your students' bursar accounts mid-September.

We kindly ask that all requests be submitted by the deadline of Friday, July 25th, 2025 at 5:00 pm EST to allow sufficient preparation. Requests received after this deadline will be considered on a rolling basis and may result in a denied request. **Please note, late submissions will be subject to a $40.00 late fee.**

### Early Arrival for Athletics/Program/Organization:

If you will be arriving early for a pre-approved Athletics or a Fordham Affiliated Organization/Program you should **not** fill out this form. (for example: a pre-season athlete, an Orientation Leader, Urban Plunge Assistant, Orientation Volunteer for Move In, Resident Assistant, etc.)

Your coach or advisor should submit an early arrival request on your behalf. Please reach out to your coach/advisor and confirm that they will be providing the Office of Residential Life at Rose Hill with a list of approved students for early arrival. After receiving the list, the Office of Residential Life at Rose Hill will subsequently reach out to you with confirmation and move in details.

### Early Arrival on Sunday, August 24th:

Sunday, August 24th is First Year move in day. Due to this, anyone who is not a First Year student will not be able to drive a car onto campus on August 24th until after 5:00 pm. You may still apply for Early Arrival on this day, but please note that if you are approved, you will not be able to use your car until 5:00pm. Note that the Early Arrival fee will still apply.
