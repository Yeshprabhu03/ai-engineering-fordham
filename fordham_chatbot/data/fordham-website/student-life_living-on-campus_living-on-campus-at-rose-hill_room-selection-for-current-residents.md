# Room Selection for Current Rose Hill Campus Residents

**Room Selection and Housing Assignments: An Inclusive Community**

The Office of Residential Life seeks to manage the room selection process in a manner that assures students receive housing assignments that are safe, respectful of personal dignity, and private and that further the core educational and community-building missions of our University. With these goals in mind, we will work on a case-by-case basis with individual residents to identify housing options and an assignment that aligns with their gender self-identity.

If you would like to discuss the process further and learn more about how to ensure that you will be able to live in a space appropriate to your identity, Nicole Vaughan, Associate Director of Residential Life for Operations at Rose Hill at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#036d756276646b626d3743656c71676b626e2d666776) or by calling the Office of Residential Life at 718-817-3080.

We respect your privacy: you may also simply indicate in the housing application that you would like to further discuss your specific housing needs and preferences related to your gender identity. A member of our staff will reach out to you and speak with you individually about your needs and the options that are available.

Students should inquire about their options as early in the process as possible and while the widest range of options are available. This is a private process and information related to student gender identity is considered confidential and shared only with staff who need to assist with your request.

Timeslots are sent on Thursday, March 26 - Friday, March 27, 2026.

Time slots will be assigned with priority given based on Graduation Year, with seniors/juniors picking first. The Group Leader should be the member of the group with the best timeslot. Time slots will not be averaged unless you have group members with mixed graduation years.

During Phase 3, residents will form groups for room selection. Phase 3 will begin on

**Monday, March 30, 2026**and must be completed prior to room selection. This should be completed by**Wednesday, April 8, 2026**in your housing portal.Students must decide with whom they want to live for next year. Based on the number of potential roommates, the roommates should discuss what buildings they are interested in living in for next year.

- Groups of 1 must select a single room (O’Hare Hall, Loschert Hall, Alumni Court South, Finlay Hall)
- Groups of 2 must select a double room (O’Hare Hall, Finlay Hall)
- Groups of 3 must select a triple room (Finlay Hall, O’Hare Hall)
- Groups of 4 must select an apartment (Walsh Hall, Campbell Hall, Salice Conley Hall)
- Groups of 5 must select an apartment for 5 people (Campbell Hall, Salice-Conley Halls, Hughes House)
- Groups of 6 must select an apartment for 6 people (Walsh, Campbell, Salice-Conley Halls and Hughes House)
- Groups of 7 must select an apartment for 7 people (Arthur, Hughes, and Terra Nova Houses)

Once this is decided, students must assign one person in their group to be their group leader.

**THE GROUP LEADER SHOULD BE THE PERSON WITH THE BEST TIME SLOT.**The group leader will have a lot of responsibility through the room selection process.

**IMPORTANT**: Students should discuss several**backup plans**in the event they are unable to obtain their first choice through the room selection process and be prepared to select a different building choice OR regroup into smaller or larger groups based on what housing options are left for them to choose.*- Example*: A group of 6 should be prepared to shift into 2 groups of 3 and try for triples in Finlay Hall or O’Hare Hall if a 6 person apartment is not available once it comes time for their group to pick a room.*- Example*: A group of 2 should be prepared to add a third roommate if there are no doubles left at the time of their room selection in order for them to select a triple room if is available at that time. -
**The Role of the Group Leader:**The group leader should be the member of the group with the best timeslot. The group leader has the following capabilities:

- The only person allowed to create a group.
- The only person allowed to verify the group after it is created and after all group members are added.
- Is allowed to modify the group after it is verified (this is possible so that if the type of room your Group seeks is no longer available prior to your group’s room selection time, your group leader can make changes to the group to obtain a different type of room).
- Only the group leader is allowed to delete the entire group, however, individual members can delete themselves from a group.
- Only the group leader will be able to enter the "Browse Available Rooms" and select room(s) for the group. However, on "regrouping" days, all students will be able to access a "Room Search Available" page that will enable all students to see what rooms are available prior to their room selection day. This feature will not be available on days designated for room selection to prevent system overload.

**Creating a Group (Group Leaders Only!)****If all Group Members have the Same Expected Graduation Years:**- The Group Leader must create a group by selecting "create a new group."
- Everyone’s group must have only 1 group leader who will be responsible for verifying your group and picking your room during the group leader’s timeslot.
- You can only be in 1 group at a time!
- Looking for a single? You still must create a group with 1 member (yourself).
- The Group Leader must create a group Name and Password.
- Enter group name of your choice. (
**Tip**: Administrators can see your group name; choose something that you would not mind saying to a staff member if you need any assistance after this step!) - Enter a password. Confirm the password. Click “Save and Continue.” ○ Remember the Group Name and Password. Give the Group Name and Password to the members of your group so they can join the group. ○ Once everyone has joined, the group leader must verify the group prior to room selection.
**Note**: Any time a change is made to the group, the group leader must re-verify the group.

- Enter group name of your choice. (
- As the Group Members add themselves to the group, the Group Leader must
**verify**the group each time there is a change until the group is final and select save and continue.

**If all Group Members have Different Expected Graduation Years:**- All members of the group with the
**SAME**Expected Graduation Year as the group leader should join the group. - All members of the group with a
**DIFFERENT**Expected Graduation Year than the group leader must email Residential Life at[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)including- First and Last Name
- Fordham ID Number
- Name of Group you wish to join & Group Password

- If Residential Life approves the group, an averaged time slot of all group members will be given to the group leader and the group will be verified. Requests should be made at least 24 hours in advance of any change.

**Important Details for Group Leaders Regarding Group Formation**- Do not create a group of more than 7 individuals, as that is the size of the largest apartment available. Groups too large for the available space remaining will be notified to break up by ORL. (
*Example*: if there are no apartments left, no groups larger than 3 should be created) - If additional individuals somehow obtain the group name and password and add themselves to the group, remove the individual from the group; they will be notified of removal.
- Check to make sure ALL of the correct group members are in the group and verify the group;
**if the group is not verified, it is not yet considered an actual group and will not be able to select a room.** - When you do things that impact the group, members should receive an automated email to their Fordham email accounts. Members will know if you remove them from the group.
- When individuals choose to enter a group, they enter with the understanding that the group leader is responsible for making many decisions on behalf of all group members. If individuals are unhappy with decisions made by the group leader, the Office of Residential Life will not be able to change group leader decisions.
-
**Only the group leader will be able to see the “Browse Available Room Page” to select a room during their time slot,**however, on non-Room Selection Days, all group members can see rooms that are available in the "Browse Available Rooms" page.

**How to Join a Group (Group Members)**Group members must receive the Group Name and password from the Group Leader. Group members should select "add yourself to a group" and then enter the group name and password.

- Enter the Group Name given to you by your Group Leader.
- Enter the Password given to you by your Group Leader.
- Click Save and Continue.

Group members will be able to see who is in the group as members are verified. You must click Save and Continue at the bottom of this page in order to complete the process of joining a group. Group members should also receive emails to their Fordham email account when the group leader does things that impact the group.

**Re-Grouping Rules**If your group leader cannot find a room to accommodate your entire group, one of three things can happen:

- Add people to your group to get a larger room. Your group leader must give your group name and password to a new group member and re-verify the group after she/he has been added to the group. When the new group is verified, the group leader can pick a different room with more beds with the same time slot.
- Delete people from your group to get a smaller room. Your group leader must delete the person, re-verify the group, and assign the people left in the group to a smaller room with the same time slot.
**YOU SHOULD NOT BE DELETING STUDENTS FROM YOUR GROUP WITHOUT SPEAKING WITH THEM FIRST.**Students who have been deleted from a group should receive a notification to their Fordham email account. The students who are deleted have the following options:-
- Regroup with other students.
- Regroup as a group of 1 and try to get a single.
- Enter into Post-Room Selection.


-
- Your group leader can delete the entire group. Members of the group should receive a notification to their Fordham email account. Each person from the group has the following options:

-
- Regroup with other students.
- Regroup as a group of 1 and try to get a single.
- Enter into Post-Room Selection.


**How to Re-Group:**The group should select a new group leader whose time has already passed OR who has the BEST timeslot among the new group members. That new group leader should follow the above instructions: "Group Leaders: How groups are created."

If the group leader's time slot has already passed, the new group can pick a room immediately. If the group leader's timeslot has not yet passed, the new group must wait for this new timeslot.

-
**View Open Rooms via “Browse Available Rooms”**On days when Room Selection is not scheduled, group members can view buildings and rooms that are currently available.

**Note**: group members will NOT be able to enter the “Room Search Wizard.” Select a building by clicking on the name of the building; then on the next page select the floor that you would like to view.**Selecting a Room (Not An Apartment)**- Scroll down to see the floors in which rooms are available in the selected building.

- A screen will display all of the spaces available for that floor. Each ROOM is listed as one line.
- Click on the room(s) you want and then click “Save and Continue.”
- Note: You must pick the correct amount of spaces for the people in your group. Groups of 3 must pick a triple, groups of 2 must pick a double, etc.
**Group leaders can pick any combination of rooms that match the size of their group.**For example, if the Group Leader tries to find a triple for a group of 3, and triples are no longer available, the Group Leader can choose a single and a double on the**same floor of the same building**(see Role of Group Leader) or regroup (see Regrouping Rules).

- Once the room is/rooms are selected, the Group Leader must assign all group members to a space in the room.
**A screen will display a list of you and all of the group members.**Each person will have a drop down menu that lists all of the bed spaces available. The number of options will match the number of beds in the room you selected.**You must assign each member of your group to a bed space and then click "Reserve Beds."**- For room selection (
**not for apartment selection**) it does not matter in which space the Group Leader assigns each Group Member. - The Group Leader must then click
**“Reserve Beds.” The Group Leader’s room selections are final and cannot be changed**; you will not be able to reenter the "Room Search Wizard."


**Selecting an Apartment (Not A Room)**- A screen will display what floors still have apartments available. It will not break down the type of apartment (4, 5 or 6 person). It will only show that apartments are available.
- Click (once, not twice) on the floor on which you want to live and click “Save and Continue.”

- A screen will display all of the rooms available. Therefore, since apartments have multiple bedrooms, multiple lines/rooms will be listed.
- Select the rooms you want by selecting all of the lines associated with that apartment.
- You must select ALL items at once. You DO NOT need to hold the "Shift" or "Ctrl" key to select more than one item; simply click on each item. Then, click “Save & Continue.”

- Once the rooms in an apartment are selected, the Group Leader must assign all group members to a space in the apartment.
- A screen will display a list of you and all of the group members. Each person will have a drop down menu that lists all of the bed spaces available. The number of options will match the number of beds in the apartment you selected.
**You must assign each member of your group to a bed space and then click "Reserve Beds."** - Once the group leader has reserved beds, students will be assigned exactly according to the designation. The Group Leader’s room selections are final and cannot be changed; you will not be able to reenter the "Room Search Wizard."

- A screen will display a list of you and all of the group members. Each person will have a drop down menu that lists all of the bed spaces available. The number of options will match the number of beds in the apartment you selected.

**Internal Transfers****Students planning to academically transfer to the Lincoln Center campus for Fall 2026**and who would like to live in McMahon Hall at Lincoln Center must pay their $200 housing deposit and go through the Rose Hill housing selection process for 2026-2027 and sign up on the Lincoln Center housing waitlist.- If there is space at the Lincoln Center campus for Fall 2026, students who successfully complete an internal transfer to Lincoln Center will be notified throughout the summer months and given a new housing assignment at the Lincoln Center campus.
- If a student planning to transfer to Lincoln Center for Fall 2026 does not go through the Rose Hill room selection process, he or she will be considered a commuter student and not given housing at either campus for Fall 2026. Once housing becomes available at Lincoln Center, students who have completed an internal transfer and paid their $200 housing deposit will need to move to the Lincoln Center campus.
