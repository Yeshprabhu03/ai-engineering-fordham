# Security and Facilities Management

Fordham University has security personnel on-campus 24 hours a day. These guards are present in the residence halls, on patrol on campus, and available to respond to incidents. The security department can be reached at 718-817-2222.

In addition, staff are trained to handle emergency situations and to work with security to address concerns. Resident Assistants are spread out throughout Fordham-operated housing and are on duty each night in order to serve as a resource to residents in need.

There are blue emergency phones spread throughout both campuses. On the Rose Hill campus, shuttle services are offered at certain times at night.
