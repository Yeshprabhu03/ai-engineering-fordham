# Pre-Commencement Celebrations

Principles of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging are central to [our mission as a Jesuit institution](/about/living-the-mission/diversity-and-inclusion/) and connect us to a long Catholic tradition of advocating for the dignity and worth of every person.

In the spirit of *cura personalis*, care for the whole person, the Office of Multicultural Affairs is pleased to announce our 5th annual Pre-Commencement Celebrations. These events are co-sponsored by the Office of Equity, Inclusion, and Opportunity and the Office of the President. We invite the Fordham community to join us in celebrating and honoring graduating seniors from a range of diverse communities as we acknowledge their accomplishments and contributions to Fordham University.
