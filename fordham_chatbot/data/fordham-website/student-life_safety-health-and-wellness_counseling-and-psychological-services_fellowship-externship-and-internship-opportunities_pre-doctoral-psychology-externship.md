# CPS Pre-Doctoral Psychology Externship


**Fordham University’s Counseling and Psychological Services**

**Predoctoral Level Externship in College Mental Health Counseling**


Fordham University’s Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS) offers a nine-month pre-doctoral externship at both our Rose Hill and Lincoln Center offices, commencing in August 2026. The externship offers a comprehensive training experience in university mental health, with an emphasis on individual therapy, group therapy, crisis management, and outreach to a diverse undergraduate and graduate student population of approximately 15,000 students. CPS approaches clinical work, supervision, and training through an integrative lens, with a strong emphasis on conceptualizing from a psychodynamic and social justice perspective. The externship requires a minimum commitment of 16 hours per week. Externs are expected to maintain an active caseload of 10-12 individual psychotherapy clients, see walk-in clients as needed, participate in outreach events, and may have the opportunity to co-lead a psychotherapy group.

Externs will receive 1 hour of individual supervision with a staff member and will be provided with additional supervision for co-leading groups and developing/implementing outreach activities. The externship also includes a year-long, three-hour formal training component, held every Tuesday from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., which consists of a case conference, group supervision, a seminar on psychotherapy theory and process in the Fall semester, and a multicultural seminar in the Spring semester.

Our counseling center is composed of licensed psychologists, social workers, mental health counselors, post-graduate fellows, and clinical trainees from various mental health

disciplines (psychology, social work, mental health counseling, psychiatry, etc.). We value teamwork and have a strong emphasis on working collaboratively across different disciplines.

We accept doctoral students from APA-accredited programs in clinical, school, and counseling psychology. We work with externs at different levels of training. We are committed to diversifying our staff and to increasing diversity in the field through quality training. We welcome and encourage applications from individuals from all religious backgrounds, racial/ethnic minority individuals, immigrants and international students, LGBTQ and gender-expansive individuals, second-career/non-traditional-age applicants, individuals with disabilities, and others who are historically underrepresented in the mental health fields.

CPS will be participating in the Northeastern Regional Externship Match for practicum positions beginning in 2026.
