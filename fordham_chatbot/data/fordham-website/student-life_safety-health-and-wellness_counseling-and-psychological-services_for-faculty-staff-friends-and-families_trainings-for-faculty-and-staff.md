# Trainings for Faculty and Staff

## Kognito: Online Training

Today's college students are experiencing increasing academic, financial, familial, and social stressors, which can lead to significant emotional distress and contribute to or exacerbate serious psychological problems, such as depression, anxiety, substance abuse, suicidal thoughts, and other mental health concerns. Unfortunately, these concerns can interfere with students' academic functioning and at times compromise their ability to remain in school.

As faculty and staff, you play an important role in ensuring that students receive the assistance, guidance, and support they need to flourish intellectually, academically, and psychologically during their time at Fordham. To support you in this role, the Office of Counseling and Psychological Services offers an interactive online training, Kognito, that has been empirically demonstrated to assist faculty with learning best practices for identifying, approaching, and, if necessary, referring students in psychological distress. American Foundation for Suicide Prevention has also identified this training as a best practice resource for preventing suicide.

We strongly encourage you to participate in this online course, which we trust will contribute to the realization of our University's mission to provide an education that is student-centered, attentive to the development of the whole person, and based on close collaboration between students, faculty, and staff.

-
Have you noticed a friend who seems excessively sad, irritable, stressed-out, or just "not themselves" Who is engaging in unhealthy behaviors, sleeping all-day, or self-isolating? If so, express your concern, and encourage them to seek help. You're not alone: Friends are the #1 referral source for students at counseling and psychological services (CPS).

**How can I help?**- Consult with professional staff. Please contact one of the staff members below for solid advice or support. It's often helpful to do so in advance of approaching your friend about the situation.
- Empathize. Listen carefully, and communicate your understanding of the issue as your friend describes it.
- Encourage your friend to talk and accept support. Let them know that it is normal and a sign of strength to seek support from a trusted person when in distress or dealing with difficult life issues.
- Offer options. Your friend may find it helpful to talk with their RA or RD, a campus ministry staff member, a trusted academic dean, or family member. Offer to help begin the conversation.
- Suggest speaking with a therapist at CPS, where services are free and confidential. Tell your friend that talking to a therapist is a mature and healthy decision, and that therapists can tailor services to their needs.
- Provide them with contact information for CPS, or offer to walk them over.
- Follow-up. Ask how they're doing in the days and weeks ahead, and whether they received assistance and support

**When listening isn't enough...**Sometimes a friend's problem can feel like more than you can handle on our own. Know your limits. In fact, there are some thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that should NOT stay 'just between friends.' Acknowledge that you don't have the expertise to help sufficiently, but that you care and will help your friend get the help they need. It's important to know that even serious and persistent mental health problems, including major depression and suicidal thoughts, are treatable conditions with the right professional help
