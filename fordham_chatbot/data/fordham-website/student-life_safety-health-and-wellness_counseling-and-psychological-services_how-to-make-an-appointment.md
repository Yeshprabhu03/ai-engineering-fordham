# Counseling and Psychological Services: How to Make an Appointment

To set up your first appointment, please call or stop by one of our offices Monday through Thursday from 9 a.m.-7 p.m. and Friday from 9 a.m.-5 p.m. You will initially be scheduled for a brief phone screening with one of our counselors. This screening will take approximately 30 minutes and will help us determine how to best assist you.

Same day walk-in appointments are available in case of an urgent situation and can be accessed by speaking with someone at our front desk.
