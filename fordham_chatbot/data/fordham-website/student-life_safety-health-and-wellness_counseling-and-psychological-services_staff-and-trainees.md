I look forward to working with you and creating meaningful connections that foster an inclusive Fordham community!


**Mia Garcia**My name is Mia Garcia (she/her), and I am currently a senior majoring in Psychology with a minor in English. Outside the classroom, you might find me either as your Ram Van driver, Secretary for WomeninSTEM, or your FUEMS EMT (though hopefully you won’t need me for the latter). In my downtime, I love to read, bake, and create—whether that’s photography, visual arts, or writing. I’m a big museum goer and a victim of buying a $7 matcha latte if it means having a good time. After graduation, I hope to pursue a career in nursing with a specialty in psychiatry. Being a peer counselor to me means centering the connections I make, which will give me a foundation for the future people I work with. I look forward to connecting with all of you!
