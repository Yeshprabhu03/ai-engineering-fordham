# Emergency Medical Service Fees

Cost of Emergency Medical Attention

For all medically related calls, there is a nominal fee for general transports omitting alcohol or sexual assault transports.

This nominal fee has been implemented to ensure that FUEMS has the proper funding to allow for adequate transportation and care of patients. However for those patients who need medical attention for intoxication, physical/sexual assault, or psychological emergencies, the fifty dollar fee is waived. This waiver is provided so that no one is ever deterred from calling for help in the most sensitive of circumstances.

Your health and safety is our top priority and no one should be discouraged from calling due to the possibility of being charged for transport.
