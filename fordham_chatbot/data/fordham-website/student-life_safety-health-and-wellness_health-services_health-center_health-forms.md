# Health Forms

NYS Public Health Law Section 2165 requires all students attending post-secondary institutions born on or after January 1, 1957 and registered for 6 or more credit hours to demonstrate immunity to Measles, Mumps and Rubella. NYS Public Health Law 2167 requires post-secondary institutions to distribute a form with written information about the risks of meningococcal meningitis and the benefits of meningococcal immunization to each student who is enrolled for at least 6 semester hours.

Here at Fordham, the Meningitis vaccines are highly recommended for students living in the dorms. If a student has not received the Meningitis ACWY vaccine within the past 5 years and a complete 2 or 3 dose series of Meningitis B vaccine, they must sign the Meningitis Response form indicating they have received and read the Meningitis Fact Sheet. This form can be located and completed in your student health portal or on page 4 of the downloadable immunization form below.

You may complete all of your immunization requirements through your Fordham Student Health Portal, which is located in your Fordham account under My Apps in the For Students section or by clicking this link [https://fordham.studenthealthportal.com/forms](https://fordham.studenthealthportal.com/Forms). When you enter your Student Health Portal, click on My Forms to access all of your required medical and immunization forms. Once you have completed the required forms, you may also upload the supporting documentation to your Student Health Portal.

Fordham University will require all students- undergraduates and students in graduate and professional schools-- to be vaccinated by the opening of the semester (medical and religious accommodations will be considered).
