**Immunizations**

**NEW YORK STATE VACCINATION LAW 2165 and 2167:**

*If a student is registered to attend for less than 6 semester hours or 4 credit hours per quarter, the immunization requirements do not apply to that student. If an enrollee at a post-secondary institution was born before 1957, he/she does not have to comply with PHL Section 2165 immunization requirements.*

**SECTION I. MMR: Two doses** are required for entry into Fordham University. This combination vaccine is given because it protects from **M**easles, **M**umps, and **R**ubella. ***MMR was not available in the U.S. before 1/1/1972.***

**1. Measles (Rubeola):** Students born on or after January 1, 1957 must submit proof of immunity to measles. Only **ONE **of the following is required:

- The student must submit proof of
of live measles vaccine: the first dose given no more than 4 days prior to the student's first birthday and the second at least 28 days after the first dose; or*two doses* - The student must submit
(titer) to measles. This means the demonstration of measles antibodies through a blood test performed by an approved medical laboratory; or*serological proof of immunity* - The student must submit a statement from the diagnosing physician, physician assistant or nurse practitioner that the student has had measles disease; or
- The student must submit proof of honorable discharge from the armed services within 10 years from the date of application to the institution. The proof of honorable discharge shall qualify as a certificate enabling a student to attend the institution pending actual receipt of immunization records from the armed services; or
- If a student is unable to access his/her immunization record from a health care provider or previous school, documentation that proves the student attended primary or secondary school in the United States after 1980 will be sufficient proof that the student received one dose of live measles vaccine. If this option is used, the second dose of measles vaccine must have been administered within one year of attendance at a post-secondary institution.

**2. Mumps:** Students born on or after January 1, 1957 must submit proof of immunity to mumps. Only **ONE** of the following is required:

- The student must submit proof of
of live mumps vaccine given no more than 4 days prior to the student's first birthday; or*two doses* - The student must submit
(titer) to mumps. This means the demonstration of mumps antibodies through a blood test performed by an approved medical laboratory; or*serological proof of immunity* - The student must submit a statement from the diagnosing physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner that the student has had mumps disease; or
- The student must submit proof of honorable discharge from the armed services within 10 years from the date of application to the institution. The proof of honorable discharge shall qualify as a certificate enabling a student to attend the institution pending actual receipt of immunization records from the armed services.

**3. Rubella (German measles):** Students born on or after January 1, 1957 must submit proof of immunity to rubella. Only **ONE** of the following is required:

- The student must submit proof of
of live rubella vaccine: the first dose given no more than 4 days prior to the student's first birthday; or*one dose* - The student must submit
(titer) to rubella. This means the demonstration of rubella antibodies through a blood test performed by an approved medical laboratory (Since rubella rashes resemble rashes of other diseases, it is impossible to diagnose reliably on clinical grounds alone. Serological evidence is the only permissible alternative to immunization.); or the student must submit proof of honorable discharge from the armed services within 10 years from the date of application to the institution. The proof of honorable discharge shall qualify as a certificate enabling a student to attend the institution pending actual receipt of immunization records from the armed services.*serological proof of immunity*

**SECTION II. Meningococcal Meningitis:**

New York State PHL Section 2167 requires post-secondary institutions to distribute information about meningococcal disease and immunization to the students, or parents or guardians of students under the age of 18, accompanied by a response form. The institution is required to maintain appropriate documentation for each student. Acceptable documentation includes *any* of the following:

- A vaccine record indicating at least 1 dose of meningococcal ACWY vaccine within the last 5 years or a complete 2- or 3-dose series or MenB without a response form; or
- A signed response form with a vaccine record (If a student submits a response form selecting this option, a vaccine record must be attached); or
- A signed response form indicating that the student will obtain meningococcal vaccine within 30 days; or
- A signed response form indicating that the student will not obtain immunization against meningococcal disease.

If the student has not received meningococcal vaccine within the past 5 years, then he/she must submit the signed response form.

**Information about Meningococcal Disease:** College students, especially first years living in residence halls, are at a slightly increased risk for contacting meningococcal disease. The bacterial form of this disease can lead to serious complications such as swelling of the brain, coma, and even death within a short period of time. Several vaccines are currently available that will decrease, but not completely eliminate, a person’s risk of acquiring meningococcal meningitis. This element of uncertainty remains because there are five (5) different Serotypes (A, B, C, Y, & W-135). The vaccines, Menactra™ and Menveo™, probably protect against the strains ACWY for 3-5 years, and are extremely safe for use. Menactra™ vaccine is available at the Fordham University Health Services. Also available are the vaccines for Meningitis Serogroup B: Trumenba (3 dose series) and Bexsero (2 dose series). Please see the Meningitis Fact Sheet.

**SE****C****T****ION III. Tuberculosis (TB) Risk Factor Screening: All students must complete Part 1- Tuberculosis (TB) Screening Questionnaire and have it signed by your health care provider. If the student answers YES to any of those questions, Fordham University requires that you receive a Clinical Assessment from your healthcare provider as soon as possible, prior to the start of the semester. Part 2 and Part 3 must be completed by a healthcare provider.**

**Information about TB Screening**: Universal tuberculin or Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) testing is not recommended in the U.S and other low-incidence countries due to the high rate of false positive results. Tuberculin or IGRA testing is indicated for children/individuals with the following risk factors for TB:

- History of exposure to anyone with TB
- Immigration from a country with a high incidence of TB
- Travel to a high-incidence country where housing was with family members or local resident-not hotels, resorts, etc.
- Household contact with parents or others who immigrated from a country with a high incidence of TB and tuberculin status unknown (consider testing at ages 1,5,12)
- Exposure to individuals in the past 5 years who are HIV-infected, homeless, institutionalized, users of illicit drugs, incarcerated ( test all groups every 2-3 years
- HIV infection (test yearly), diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, malnutrition, reticuloendothelial disease, other immunodeficiencies or receiving immunosuppressive therapy

**We strongly recommend that international students from high risk countries have the IGRA testing completed**. *Countries with a high incidence of TB (incidence of >20/100,000) are listed at the following link*: [https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2022/high-tb-burden-country-profiles](https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2022/high-tb-burden-country-profiles). (Includes most countries of Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, Central, and South America)

**Remember!**

Immunization and physical forms are due to Health Services no later than July 15.
