**Q: What is University Health Services (UHS)?****A:**UHS is your on-campus resource for urgent primary care, behavioral health needs, support and advocacy for students who have suffered interpersonal violence, and assessment and brief treatment for students who are struggling with substance abuse.**Q: Should I go to UHS for all of my care?****A:**For all Fordham students, UHS will be your primary care provider (PCP).**Q: Does my student health insurance plan cover all of UHS’ services?****A:**Office visits for our UHS providers and nurses are offered at no charge. However, if there is an in-office test, immunization, or procedure, your student account may be billed. Please call us to verify the most up-to-date fee schedule.Charges are posted to your student account (BURSAR). An itemized statement (receipt) is available in your Student Health Portal and can be submitted to your insurance provider for possible reimbursement, depending upon your insurance coverage.

Laboratory testing through Fordham University’s onsite LabCorp and QUEST laboratory will be billed to your insurance company—whether your coverage is through SHIP or a different plan. You are responsible for any amounts not covered by your insurance.

**Q: What services are not available through UHS?****A:**UHS providers do not offer ongoing or extensive management of most medical conditions. You will be referred to a non-UHS provider for any care requiring hospitalization or surgery, and may be referred to a non-UHS provider if you require ongoing care for issues such as- Severe asthma
- Diabetes
- Chronic depression
- Inflammatory bowel disorders

**Q: Does UHS refer students to SHIP in-network providers?****A:**Generally, UHS will refer students to providers in the SHIP network. However, if a student’s health need dictates care by a provider outside the SHIP network, UHS will make the referral to an out-of-network provider.**Q: If I need to see a non-UHS provider, will my parent’s health insurance cover this****care?****A:**If you have coverage under your parent’s health insurance, you will want to use providers in your plan’s network. If that network does not offer providers in New York City at a convenient location, you will have to pay the higher, out-of-network rate. You may wish to enroll in SHIP, rather than continue coverage under your parent’s plan and pay this higher out-of-network cost for care. -
**Q: What are SHIP’s main advantages?****A:**SHIP is predictable and convenient.**Predictable Costs**

- If you need to see a doctor, fill a prescription, or go to the emergency room, you’ll pay a fixed dollar amount when you use an in-network provider. The plan pays the rest. Copays keep your out-of-pocket costs predictable and manageable.
- For other types of care, you may also pay a deductible and coinsurance for certain visits, procedures, and diagnostic tests like x-rays. The plan has fixed coinsurance—generally 20%—but the amount you pay will be varied.

**Convenience**

- You’ll find a wide network of participating providers in New York City. Many are affiliated with Fordham University and are just a walk, bus ride, or few train stops away.

**Q: Does SHIP cover behavioral health?****A:**Yes. To review Behavioral Health Benefits and costs please visit the Aetna website at aetnastudenthealth.com**Q: If I have dependents, will SHIP cover them?****A:**Dependent coverage is available and eligible dependents include your spouse and dependent children up to age 26. Students must enroll dependents online and pay directly to aetnastudenthealth.com.**Q: Will my parent’s plan cost more than SHIP?****A:**It may or may not; you’ll have to take a close look at both the cost of coverage (your premium) and the potential cost of care (what you pay in deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance). The only way to know is to compare your potential costs for the types of care you may need: doctor or specialist visits, prescription medication, lab tests, and perhaps a trip to the emergency room or hospitalization. When you compare your potential costs, you may discover that SHIP coverage offers the best value. For example, your parent’s plan may have:**A Different Network**

- For many health plans—like SHIP—you pay much less for care when you use “in-network providers' '—doctors and facilities affiliated with the insurance company’s network. If you use a provider outside this network, you’ll pay more—maybe a lot more. When UHS refers you to a non-UHS provider, they will likely refer to someone in the SHIP network, keeping your costs as low as possible. However, if this provider is not in your parent’s plan’s network, your out-of-pocket costs could be much higher.

**High Premiums**

- Chances are your parents pay additional premiums to cover you under their plan. SHIP coverage costs are generally less than what your parent/guardian pays for dependent coverage under their plan.

**A High Deductible**

- Your parents may have a so-called “high deductible health plan,” and may have to pay $1,500, $3,000, or even more before their plan starts paying benefits for you. In contrast, the SHIP deductible is just $400 per policy.

**Q: What happens if I want to enroll in SHIP and keep my current plan?****A:**If you wish, you can continue your current coverage and enroll in SHIP for additional coverage. When you are covered by more than one plan, certain rules establish which plan pays benefits first; this is called “coordination of benefits.” The coordination of benefit rules under SHIP are as follows:- Generally, SHIP will pay benefits first, and your plan will pay second.

**Q: What if I need care when UHS is closed?****A:**When UHS is closed, for minor conditions you may wish to utilize Teladoc® for atelemedicine visit, a walk-in clinic such as CityMD, or an urgent care clinic. In the case of severe, life-threatening accidental injury or illness, visit an emergency room.

**Q: How do I know if my doctor is in Aetna’s network?****A:**Use the[Aetna Provider Directory](https://www.aetna.com/dsepublic/#/contentPage?page=providerSearchLanding&site_id=studenthealth)to search for your provider.**Q: Does SHIP cover dental and vision?**A: Yes SHIP does cover dental but not vision. However, Aetna offers Perventative plan that only covers cleaning, xrays. This plan does not cover major restorative procedures. The cost is $375 for 25/26.
