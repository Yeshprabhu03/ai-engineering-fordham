# Allergy Health Clinic

Allergy injections can be administered under the supervision of a nurse practitioner or physician as indicated by the referring allergist. We have allergy forms that must be completed by the allergist and student before we can administer injections. Students should bring their serum, dose schedule and all related forms to the University Health Services. We have a temperature regulated refrigerator at both offices to store allergy serum. Allergy serum will not be administered without the above information.

Visits are by appointment only.
