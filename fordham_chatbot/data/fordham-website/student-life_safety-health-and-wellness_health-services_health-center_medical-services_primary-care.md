# Primary Care

University Health Services is available to meet the health care needs of students at Fordham University. Our goal is to keep you well, help you get the care you need when you are not, and to empower you to make informed decisions about your health. In addition, you'll learn how to:

- Deal with an illness or injury.
- To recognize when you need to seek help for a health problem.
- How to become an effective health care consumer so that you can make informed decisions.
- Where to get information to assist you in making informed health care decisions.

Student Health Services provides direct care, individual health counseling, and health teaching. Small group workshops on common health interests of the students occur throughout the year. All registered students can receive health care services.
