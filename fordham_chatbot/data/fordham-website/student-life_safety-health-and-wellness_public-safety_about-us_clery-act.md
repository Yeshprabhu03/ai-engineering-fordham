# Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Crime Statistics Act (Clery Act)

This annual letter is a reminder that the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Crime Statistics Act (Clery Act) requires that all persons listed as Campus Security Authorities must report crimes immediately to Fordham’s Department of Public Safety.

Campus Security Authorities include:

- The University president
- The University provost
- All University vice presidents
- All University deans
- All University administrators
- Faculty advisors/faculty
- All Student Affairs deans, directors, and administrators
- Athletic directors and coaches
- Resident directors and resident assistants
- Director and administrators, Center for Community Engaged Learning
- Director, administrators and coordinator, Global Outreach
- Campus judicial administrators
- Department of Public Safety staff
- Clerical personnel, maintenance personnel
- Cafeteria staff
- All Campus officials with significant responsibility for students

University personnel exempt from mandated reporting to the Department of Public Safety are:

- Pastoral counselors from Campus Ministry acting in their official capacity
- Professional mental health counselors from Counseling and Psychological Services acting in their official capacity
- Medical providers in University Health Services

Notwithstanding the aforementioned exemptions from mandated reporting, every member of the University community is strongly encouraged to report any crime or emergency immediately to the Department of Public Safety.

The Clery Act requires the University to disclose the following crime statistics:

- Murder/non-negligent manslaughter; manslaughter by negligence
- Sex offenses – rape, fondling, incest, statutory rape
- Robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, motor vehicle theft, and arson
- Hate crimes – any of the above-mentioned offenses and any incidents of larceny-theft, simple assault, intimidation, or destruction/damage/vandalism of property and are motivated by the offender’s bias based on a person’s race, gender, gender identity, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, national origin, or disability
- Dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking
- Arrests and referrals for disciplinary action for carrying or possessing weapons; drug abuse violations and liquor law violations

Campus Security Authorities are not responsible for determining authoritatively whether a crime took place. That is the responsibility of the Department of Public Safety and local law enforcement (NYPD) or authorized police agency.

At Fordham University, anyone can report a crime, including the people listed above as Campus Security Authorities, by calling 718-817-2222 at any time and asking to speak with the Public Safety duty supervisor.

Public Safety also has a responsibility to notify the campus community about any crimes which pose an ongoing threat to the community. Even if you are not sure whether an ongoing threat exists, immediately contact the Department of Public Safety.

Thank you in advance for ensuring personnel under your supervision are fully complying with the aforementioned provisions of this statute.

Robert Fitzer, Associate Vice President

Department of Public Safety
