# Our Staff

The staff of the Department of Public Safety is composed of University employees and a contracted security guard agency. The Administrators/Supervisors are former ranking members of law enforcement, principally drawn from NYPD Deputy Inspectors, Captains, Lieutenants, and Sergeants. The Patrol Leaders are both former law enforcement personnel and very experienced University Public Safety Officers.

The Administrators oversee the performance of contracted guards, perform crime prevention, conduct fire safety inspections, and do both internal and external incident investigations for the University. All Public Safety staff receive continual training with guards trained each day for 15 minutes prior to taking their respective posts/assignments. The Department of Public Safety is totally oriented toward service and protection for Fordham’s students, faculty, and staff.
