# Preparing for an Active Shooter on Campus

In the unlikely event of an active shooter at a Fordham campus or building, remember to:

**Escape**: Whenever possible, get away quickly, as escaping is the safest option.**Hide**: If escape isn’t possible, find a secure room, lock or barricade the door, and stay out of sight.**Fight**: As a last resort, fight for your life. Team up with others to overwhelm and subdue the attacker if you can.

Active shooter situations are unpredictable and can change rapidly, so there is no single correct response. While it's difficult to think about worst-case scenarios, having a plan in mind can greatly increase your chances of survival and help keep our campus safe. Although these incidents may seem common in the news, the likelihood of encountering an active shooter is still very low. However, to protect ourselves and our community, we must be prepared to take decisive action—whether that means escaping, hiding, or, as a last resort, fighting to survive.

## What To Do In Case Of An Active Threat On Campus

### Escape

If you sense danger, your first priority should always be to escape. Look for an alternative exit other than the one you used to enter. Gunshots are often mistaken for firecrackers, so be alert for their sounds, and pay attention if you see or hear people screaming or running. When in doubt, it’s safer to flee first and ask questions later. Leave behind any belongings, like bags or laptops—your life is more important. Move quickly and quietly, and always be aware of the nearest exits in any building. If possible, alert others to the danger and help them escape. If you are with a group, it is usually safer to split up and run in different directions.

### Hide

If you are in a hallway or open area and cannot safely escape, find a secure room to hide in, out of the attacker’s sight. Lock the door, turn off the lights, and create as many obstacles as possible—these actions can buy you crucial time. If you are with a group, avoid clustering together; instead, spread out to different hiding spots around the room to prevent becoming an easy target. Ensure your phone is set to silent mode, as even vibrations can reveal your location.

Remain as quiet and inconspicuous as possible. Active shooters often seek quick and easy targets, so the harder you are to see or hear, the safer you will be. While fear is natural in this situation, take deep breaths to stay calm and focused on what you need to do to survive. If it is safe, discreetly notify Fordham Public Safety or call 911. If speaking isn’t possible, you can text 911 or use the Alertus app to quietly alert Public Safety.

### Fight

If escaping or hiding is no longer an option, you must be prepared to fight as a last resort. Stay calm, focus, and mentally prepare yourself to defend your life. Look for anything around you that could be used as a weapon. If you are with others, work together to swarm and attack the shooter simultaneously—the more people who join in, the greater the chance of overwhelming and subduing the attacker quickly. While it is natural to hesitate, remember that in this situation, hesitation can be dangerous.

Use all your strength and fight with everything you have. Strike as hard and as often as you can with any available object. When fighting for your life, there are no rules—target the attacker’s most vulnerable areas, such as the eyes, nose, throat, or groin. Bite, kick, stab, or punch—do whatever it takes to incapacitate them. If possible, separate the attacker from their weapon, but **do not pick up the weapon**; you don’t want to be mistaken for the attacker. Remember, active shooters typically have a very short window to commit violence before the police arrive. Every second you slow down or frustrate the attacker could save lives.

If you have immediate information about the attacker's movements or location, call the NYPD or discreetly text Fordham Public Safety using the Alertus app.

Remember, the police's first priority is to stop the attacker; they will not be able to assist the injured until the threat is neutralized.

When calling the Department of Public Safety or 911, provide the following information if known:

- The location of the shooter(s)
- The number of shooters
- The type(s) of weapon(s) involved
- The number of victims at the scene
- A description of the shooter(s), including gender, race, distinguishing features, clothing, or any known identity

When Law Enforcement Officers Arrive on the Scene:

- Stay calm and follow their instructions.
- Raise your hands immediately and spread your fingers.
- Avoid any sudden movements toward the officers.
- Do not point, scream, or yell.
- Do not stop the officers; evacuate in the direction from which they entered the premises.
