# Bomb Threats

If you receive a telephone call regarding a bomb, explosive device, or suspicious package, get as much information from the caller as possible.

- What does it look like?
- Why did you place the bomb?
- Where are you?
- What is your name and address?

**Try to determine the following:**

- Voice: loud, soft, male, female, etc.?
- Accent: distinct?
- Speech: slurred, clear?
- Language: foul, polite?
- Manner: calm, angry, nervous?
- Background noises: train, animals, party, etc.?
- Additional information: anything unusual or significant.
