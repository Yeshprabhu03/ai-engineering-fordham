# Earthquake

Although major earthquakes are uncommon in the New York City area, tremors do occasionally occur.

In the event of an earthquake:

- Drop to the floor.
- Take cover under a solid piece of furniture or next to an interior wall, or hold on to a sturdy piece of furniture and be prepared to move with it.
- Cover your head and neck with your arms.
- Stay where you are until the shaking stops.
- Be prepared for aftershocks, which often follow an earthquake.

**If you are outside:**

- Move to an open area away from buildings, power lines, and trees.
- If driving, pull over to the side of the road and stop immediately. Avoid overpasses and power lines.
- Stay inside the vehicle until tremors have stopped.
- Do not exit your vehicle if utility lines are leaning or touching your vehicle.

**After the earthquake:**

- Evacuate your building when it is safe and/or if instructed to do so, using the building evacuation procedures.
- If possible, provide assistance to those who have been trapped.
- Inform public safety personnel of any injured or missing persons.
- Use telephones to report emergencies only (e.g., fires, serious injuries).
- Steer clear of downed utility poles or lines.
- Stay away from damaged buildings.
