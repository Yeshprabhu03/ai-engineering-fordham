# Terrorism

It is extremely important to be aware of your surroundings at all times. Remember: "If you see something, say something!" If you notice anything that seems unusual, report it immediately.**Watch for:**

- Visitors who claim to be lost/disoriented.
- Unexpected deliveries or suspicious packages.
- Unscheduled or unannounced maintenance work.
- People asking about the Department of Public Safety, the utility rooms, or air filtration systems.
- Bags, backpacks, and luggage left unattended in public spaces.

If an attack occurs, the type of attack will dictate the response.

You should:

- Follow the instructions of emergency personnel.
- Remain inside your residence hall or academic building during a chemical, nuclear, or biological event.
- Seek shelter in an internal room without windows when possible.
- Segregate and treat exposed individuals.
- Attempt to get upwind of the contaminated area (if event occurs outside), and seek shelter immediately.
- Remain in the protected area until instructed by emergency personnel or public safety personnel.

**Note:**

- Evacuations will follow our building fire evacuation procedures with fire wardens assisting the process.
- Biological events require medical intervention, as affected individuals must be decontaminated before proceeding to a medical facility.
- Ventilation and air conditioning systems will be shut down by Facilities Operations during a terrorist event.
