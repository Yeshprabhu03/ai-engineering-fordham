# Student Code of Conduct

The Student Handbook and the Residential Life Handbook delineate certain standards of conduct expected of all students. Fordham University administers the Code of Conduct through the Office of the Dean of Students. Sanctions are imposed to promote a safe and secure learning environment. They also send a clear message that inappropriate behavior is contrary to the educational mission of the University. These sanctions may range from a disciplinary reprimand to expulsion from the University. Any member of the University community may file charges with the dean of students against a student for violation of the Code of Conduct.

When a violation is observed by or reported to a member of the Department of Public Safety, an official report of the incident is prepared and forwarded to the Office of the Dean of Students for further action. If you elect to initiate formal charges against another student, the charges should be put in writing and filed with the dean of students. Such a charge will be handled in accordance with the University judicial procedures as outlined in the Student Handbook.

**Sexual Offense**

The University pledges its efforts to ensure an environment in which the dignity and worth of all members of the community are respected. It is the policy of the University that sexual intimidation of students and employees is unacceptable behavior and will not be tolerated. The University will not tolerate unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and any other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constituting sexual harassment.

Prohibited behavior includes but is not limited to:

Forcible Sexual Offenses: Any sexual act directed against another person, forcibly or against that person's will. This includes forcible rape as well as acquaintance rape (by one or more than one companion, or someone the victim knows through mutual friends).

Non-forcible Sexual Offenses: Unlawful, non-forcible sexual intercourse, including incest and rape.

Sexual Harassment: Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal and physical conduct.

**Registered Sex Offenders**

"Megan's Law" protects our communities and universities by mandating that convicted sex offenders register with the state through the Division of Criminal Justice Services. Information regarding these convicted sex offenders is obtainable through local police agencies having jurisdiction. Such information may also be obtained through our Department of Public Safety by calling 718-817-2222 and asking for the Operations Manager or Duty Supervisor.


Police agencies having jurisdiction on our three campuses are as follows:

Rose Hill: NYPD 48th Police Precinct, 718-299-3900

Lincoln Center: NYPD 20th Police Precinct, 212-580-6411

Westchester Campus: Harrison PD, 914-967-5110


The information can also be obtained from the [New York State Department of Criminal Justice](http://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/).

**Safety and Awareness Program**

The University utilizes the following programs to promote awareness of rape/acquaintance rape:

**Freshman Caring Program**

A series of mandatory programs on important topics related to life on campus for all first-year resident students. The director of residential life administers the program. The programs are conducted during the months of September and October.

**Campus Assault and Relationship Education (CARE) Peer Educators Programming**

The Office of Residential Life formed the CARE Committee to conduct ongoing programming for the entire campus on the issues of sexual assault, harassment, and healthy relationships. Each year this committee coordinates "Take Back the Night"-type marches, publicity campaigns, guest speakers and educational programs. CARE is chaired or advised each year by a member of the resident director's staff.

**Residence Hall Staff Training**

Resident directors and resident assistants receive extensive training during the month of August in preparation for the academic year. The director of residential life conducts and oversees all training for the staff on the issues of sexual assault and harassment. Any individual who believes that he or she is being subjected to sexual harassment should utilize the mediation and resolution procedures as described in the Student Handbook, whereby an immediate response and investigation will commence. Sexual offenses can be reported to the dean of students, the director of residential life or the Department of Public Safety 24 hours a day.


Immediate reporting, with the ability to find and safeguard evidence, is crucial to subsequent prosecution should the victim decide to proceed criminally. The victim retains exclusive right to decide whether to proceed criminally or to seek other available forms of resolution. The University will actively support the victim's decision. The Department of Public Safety will facilitate in every way, including transportation, for the victim to report the incident to the local police.


If you elect to initiate a formal University charge against another student or group of students, the charges should be put in writing and filed with the dean of students. The victim and the student against whom the complaint is lodged must represent themselves during a judicial process. However, a member of the Student Affairs staff can be assigned to either party, if so desired, to act as a support person throughout the process.


Possible sanctions for those found in violation of sexual offense policies range up to and include suspension and/or expulsion from the University. Both the victim and the student against whom the complaint is lodged will be informed of the outcome of the judicial investigation. A request for change of residence hall assignment (when the victim and the respondent live in the same residence hall) or a request for academic change (when the victim and the respondent are in the same classes) will be handled by the dean or assistant dean of students.


A student who is the victim of a sexual offense may utilize the services of the Counseling Center located at Rose Hill in the O'Hare Hall Health Center, at Lincoln Center in Residence Hall, Room 211. Psychologists will provide supportive and confidential counseling. In emergency situations, professional staff are contacted to respond during off-hours. Members of the Office of Student Affairs are also available to discuss sexual assault and rape incidents and make referrals.

**Policies and Procedures at Fordham University**

Compliance with the University's policies and procedures is a necessary first step in achieving a safe environment in our community. These policies were developed to promote a safe campus and a high quality of campus life. Their effectiveness depends upon the active participation of all members of the community.

**Drug and Alcohol Abuse**

The misuse or abuse of drugs or alcohol will not be tolerated by the University. Part of Fordham's educational mission is to instruct the Fordham community on the medical, legal and social risks of substance abuse.

**Alcohol Possession and Consumption**

The University allows individuals of legal drinking age to consume alcohol in their student rooms. However, should the drinking become a public event due to noise, number of people present, or intoxication, disciplinary action will be taken. Alcohol is not allowed in freshman residence halls.

Large amounts of alcohol are not allowed in private rooms and may be confiscated at the discretion of residence hall staff. Consumption of alcoholic beverages is not allowed in the open/public areas of the campus.


It is illegal in New York state for anyone under the age of 21 to possess alcoholic beverages for consumption. Every student assumes full responsibility for their compliance with New York state laws and University policy. False or fraudulent written evidence of age for the purpose of purchasing alcoholic beverages is also illegal.

**Substance Abuse**

The University is committed to maintaining a drug-free campus. Any member of the Fordham community, faculty, staff or student, who violates this policy is subject to any series of actions, ranging from written warnings to dismissal from the University. Counseling and treatment programs are available through the University.


The University has published a report entitled "Fordham University Drug-Free Campus" that includes information on the ramifications of illicit drug use by members of the Fordham community. The publication also outlines University standards of conduct concerning drug use. It further describes the help and treatment programs that are available. Copies are available in Fordham's Personnel Office, FMH 506; the Office of Student Affairs, Keating 100; the Residential Life Office, LCR 108; and the Dean of Students Office at 400 Westchester Ave.

**Alcohol and Other Drug Education**

The Alcohol and Other Drug Education (AODE) Program provides comprehensive substance abuse prevention at Fordham University. Prevention initiatives include: educational programming, assessment and early intervention strategies. Each initiative is part of an integrated approach that is science-based, inherently student centered and guided by Fordham's rich Jesuit tradition.


AODE Program strategies center on the prevention and reduction of alcohol and other drug use, misuse and abuse. Individual targeted interventions include offering educational groups, reflective exercises, assessments and personalized feedback sessions to students who violate the University's alcohol and other drug policy. Services are available to all students interested in learning more about addiction, substance abuse related issues and how to have conversations with a friend or family member regarding substance abuse. Population targeted interventions include facilitating the freshmen core programming, AODE sessions, and advising the Peer Educators at Rose Hill and Peers Advocating Responsibility (PARty) at Lincoln Center, which are student organizations that coordinates social, educational and awareness initiatives. The AODE Program also offers referral information regarding off-campus substance abuse treatment facilities and Twelve Step related (AA/NA/Al-Anon) support groups in the area.
