# Building and Facilities Access

Members of the Fordham community, their guests and visitors have access to academic buildings and facilities on campus during the normal hours of operation. Students, faculty and staff are required to have their University identification cards in their possession while on campus. After normal business hours, the Department of Public Safety locks and secures University buildings, and access is granted in cases of true need. Access requires written authorization, submitted in advance by the appropriate University official.

**Residence Halls **

The Department of Public Safety provides a security guard to monitor access control for the residence halls between the hours of 10:15 p.m. and 6:15 a.m. every evening during the academic year. Residential Life desk assistants control evening access before the guard arrives, from 6:15-10:15 p.m. McMahon Hall at Lincoln Center is covered 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, by a security guard. Additionally, a resident assistant is on duty at all times to enhance residence hall security. All visitors are required to provide valid identification and to sign the visitor's log. A resident must escort a visitor from the lobby to the resident's room and is personally responsible for the guest's conduct during the visit. Residents must sign out guests when they leave the hall. Residents should keep their rooms locked at all times for their safety and to protect their valuables.
