# Parking Facilities

We provide parking for students, faculty, administrators, staff, and visitors in all three campuses. Parking at Fordham is based on a user fee schedule.

All students, faculty, administrators, staff and visitors that require space must pay the posted parking fee. Parking is charged each time a vehicle enters campus unless an annual permit for daytime or overnight parking has been obtained from the Department of Public Safety. Annual parking permits are charged to students’ accounts or through payroll deductions.
