**Trans Loc**

Is a transportation visualization app available to the Fordham University community through their phones “app store” free of charge. The application allows users to see in real time where the on campus and off campus shuttles are in relation to their actual location. Trans Loc maps are programmed daily to display which shuttles are operating. Users will be able to see the on campus shuttle map between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. Monday through Friday. The off campus community shuttle map is visible seven (7) days a week between the hours of 8:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. during the Fall and Spring semesters.

**Life Safety App - AlertAware**

Fordham University’s Department of Public Safety would like to introduce a new personal safety application for your smart phone. “**AlertAware**”, is now available for download from the iTunes Store as well as on Google Play.

The application is designed as an emergency texting app which allows Fordham community members to immediately notify Public Safety in the event of an emergency. The app will also allow Public Safety to immediately alert community members of emergency situations. It is important to note that Public Safety strongly recommends calling the Department of Public Safety (718-817-2222) or 911 immediately if you are in any kind of danger. However, should circumstances be such that it would be impractical to place a call, the next best course of action is to use this application. By utilizing this emergency application members will be able to send an emergency text message directly to Public Safety and summon assistance. Users are given several choices to select from to describe the emergency situation. The message along with your approximate location will be sent directly to Fordham University’s Department of Public Safety Office. The Department of Public Safety will then immediately dispatch a Public Safety Supervisor to your location, if you are in the vicinity of any of the University’s campuses. If you are an appreciable distance from any of the University’s campuses Public Safety will contact 911 after contacting you in order to best assist you.

The installation and registration guide for **iPhone and Android Users** can be found here:

Please be advised that the University does not and will not actively track any mobile phone. The app was developed to transmit the emergency message and the location the message was sent from. Once the message is sent the phone is not actively tracked. Should a user send a subsequent text message then and only then will the new location be transmitted to the Department of Public Safety.

You can contact the Department of Public Safety at 718-817-2222 if you need any additional assistance with using the app.

**NOTE**: This app is to be used in emergency situations where you feel you are in imminent danger and cannot place a phone call or dial 911.
