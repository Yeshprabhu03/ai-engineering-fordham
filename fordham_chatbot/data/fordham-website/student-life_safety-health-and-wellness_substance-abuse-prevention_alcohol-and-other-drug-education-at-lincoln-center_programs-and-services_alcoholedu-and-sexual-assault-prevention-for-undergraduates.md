# AlcoholEdu and Sexual Assault Prevention for Undergraduates

**AlcoholEdu**

As part of Fordham University’s comprehensive approach to alcohol abuse prevention, all new students enrolled in Fordham College Lincoln Center and the Gabelli School of Business are required to complete *AlcoholEdu for College*.

Used on over 500 campuses nationwide, the course uses science-based research to educate students about alcohol and its effects. AlcoholEdu for College creates a learning experience that clarifies unrealistic expectations about the effects of alcohol, links choices about drinking to academic and personal success, and helps students practice healthier and safer decision-making.

In addition to providing alcohol education for all incoming first-year students, AlcoholEdu collects survey data from students as they complete the course. All survey responses are strictly confidential; Fordham University will only receive information about the student body as a whole and will never see individual students’ answers.

The course has two sections, both of which must be completed to fulfill this requirement:
