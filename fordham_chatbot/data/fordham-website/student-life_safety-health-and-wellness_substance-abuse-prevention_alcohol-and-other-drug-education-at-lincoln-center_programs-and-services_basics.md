# BASICS

Brief Alcohol Screening and Intervention for College Students (BASICS) is based on the research and model developed at The University of Washington.

BASICS consists of multiple sessions, two to three weeks apart, which last about 60 minutes each. All sessions are one-on-one between the student and a trained BASICS facilitator.

During Session 1 the student's alcohol consumption patterns, history and related behaviors will be assessed.

Between sessions the student will be asked to track their alcohol consumption using a self monitoring card, and must complete a twenty minute online survey.

During Session 2 the student will be provided with personalized feedback based on the online assessment and self-monitoring exercise. Conversation will focus on ways the student might reduce future health, social and legal risks.

During Session 3 the student and facilitator will have a final check in, discussing any challenges that may have arisen during the implementation of the risk reduction strategies.

If you are required to complete BASICS due to a mandated referral, it is important that you contact the AODE Program in a timely manner.
