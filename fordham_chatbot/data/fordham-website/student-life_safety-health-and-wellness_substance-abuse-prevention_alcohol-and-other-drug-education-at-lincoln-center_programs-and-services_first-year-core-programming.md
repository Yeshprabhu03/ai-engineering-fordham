# First-Year CORE Programming

An aspect of the AODE Mission is to implement initiatives that "intend to change student knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intentions related to alcohol and other drug use." One way the AODE Program achieves this is by educating Fordham's first year residents and commuters during New Student Orientation as well as the first few weeks of school with CORE Programming.

This initiative is led by the AODE educator on campus. Conversations involve preventative strategies and second hand consequences of alcohol use or misuse as well as information pertaining to alcohol and other drugs and how to approach these topics and its place on campus.

The AODE program also addresses the issues of Bystander Intervention and how to make smart decisions to ensure student's safety and well-being.
