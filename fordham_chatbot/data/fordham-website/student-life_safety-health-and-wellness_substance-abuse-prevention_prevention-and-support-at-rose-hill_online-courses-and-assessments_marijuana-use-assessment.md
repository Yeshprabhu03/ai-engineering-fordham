# Marijuana Use Assessment

What is the e-TOKE?

The **electronic THC Online Knowledge Experience (e-TOKE)** is a marijuana-specific brief assessment and feedback tool designed to reduce marijuana use among college students. The assessment takes about 10-15 minutes to complete, is self-guided, and requires no face-to-face contact time with a counselor or administrator.

**What does it do?**

When you access the e-TOKE, they are prompted to enter information about themselves. In addition to demographic information, they enter information about their use of marijuana, spending patterns, and their lifestyle. After all information has been entered, you submit the form. The information you entered is validated and then processed. The e-TOKE calculates a number of variables and compares your responses to national and local college norms. Then, that information is displayed in standard HTML format.

**What does one need to use the e-TOKE?**

- A computer
- Internet access
- An Standards Compliant Internet Browser with JavaScript activated
- 10-15 minutes to complete the survey
- A printer (to print the feedback)
