# Alcohol Screening Day

Each semester, the Office of Prevention & Support and the Fordham University Peer Educators collaborate with Student Health Services and Counseling and Psychological Services to implement an alcohol screening event located in the McGinley Student Center.

Students are invited to complete the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) that is scored and interpreted by a trained professional staff member.

Following this conversation, students receive resources and are encouraged to schedule an appointment with CPS, SHS or Prevention & Support if they are interested in learning more about their use of alcohol.

The Peer Educators assist by providing incentives for completing the AUDIT and receiving the feedback.
