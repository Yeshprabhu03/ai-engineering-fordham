# Schedule an Appointment with Prevention and Support

To schedule an appointment with a Prevention and Support counselor, please contact our office at 718-817-3080 or [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3545475043505b415c5a5b75535a47515d54581b505140)

When you contact Prevention and Support, you will be emailed the link to a Preliminary Survey. **This survey must be completed and submitted before we can schedule your first appointment.** Prevention and Support staff will make every attempt to schedule your first appointment as soon as possible, but please be aware that it may take up to three weeks during busier times of the semester.

Our appointments are held Monday-Friday 9:00 am - 5:00 pm.

Please contact us with any questions about scheduling.
