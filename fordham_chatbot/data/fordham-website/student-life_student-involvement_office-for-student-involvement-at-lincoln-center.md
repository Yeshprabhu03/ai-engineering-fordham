Welcome to the Office for Student Involvement, the central hub of all student club activities for undergraduate students at the Lincoln Center campus. We provide guidance and support to student leaders looking to build, maintain and develop their clubs.

As a Jesuit institution, Fordham works to educate students as whole people. In the Office for Student Involvement, we share that goal and work toward it each day, where a dedicated administrative staff works to develop students into leaders in their community.
