# Rose Hill Fordham University Emerging/Experienced Leaders (FUEL)

This year, FUEL is guided by the theme **“Leadership In Our Midst,”** with a focus on creating a more cohesive, supportive, and impactful experience for all participants. The program brings all FUEL participants together for shared core sessions while also intentionally incorporating mentorship opportunities that foster meaningful connection and growth.

A central component of FUEL is the mentorship relationship between **Experienced Leaders** and **Emerging Leaders**. These relationships are designed to provide space for reflection, guidance, and personalized support. Each mentor–mentee pair will meet during the week following a FUEL presentation to discuss how the session’s themes connect to their experiences at Fordham and to their ongoing leadership journeys beyond the University. These conversations deepen learning from the core sessions while strengthening one-on-one engagement among participants.

This year’s FUEL program also places strong emphasis on increasing awareness of the wide range of resources available across campus. Many students arrive at Fordham without fully realizing the breadth of academic, professional, and personal support available to them. Through both presentations and mentorship conversations, Experienced Leaders will reflect on their own paths at Fordham and share practical insights, advice, and recommendations related to campus resources. This approach helps Emerging Leaders become more confident, informed, and intentional in navigating the University and making use of the opportunities available to them.

**Applications for FUEL have been sent out to all Rose Hill Undergraduate Students at this time and are due on Tuesday, January 20, 2026, at 12PM.**
