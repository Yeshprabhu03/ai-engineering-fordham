# McShane Center: Event Planning FAQ

The below guide is designed to answer our guest's most frequently asked questions regarding planning an event in the McGinley Center. If your question is not in this guide, please feel free to reach out to us prior to the date of your event and we will be happy to assist you.

-
Desired Room Setup information is expected no later than three (3) Business days prior to the event, but must be received no later than at least two (2) Business Days prior to the event. Events that do not select a setup type will have setup selected automatically. Significant changes to setup on the day of event will not be accepted. Minor requests such as additional seating or standard A/V will be reviewed on a case by case basis.

-
Unfortunately, our standard tables do not come with table cloths. However, table cloths can be rented through

[Fordham Campus Dining](http://fordham.campusdish.com/). Prior to booking any catering and / or renting any linens, please first confirm the room reservation with Campus Center Operations. If catering is confirmed first, there is no guarantee that the requested space is available. -
Please be advised that while most spaces allow outside vendors, some spaces require additional approval.

Additionally,

**please be aware that sternos are not permitted unless you are using the university’s caterer**. Electric warmers are an approved alternative. -
The McGinley Center is opened and closed by a well-trained team of student building managers and associates. The staff can provide support for basic AV needs and trouble-shooting (connecting a laptop, adjusting projector focus, obtaining an additional cord and/or minor trouble-shooting).

The staff though will not be assigned to an event to run a presentation, film or serve as an AV technician.

If the event requires a high level of support, please contact the staff during the planning phase of the event. An AV technician can be hired to manage the AV, presentation, taping or other AV needs. There is a charge for AV technicians.

Some rooms have A/V that can be activated by touch screen. We ask that if you are unsure of how to use the A/V you contact the Building Manager for support.

If equipment does not appear to be working,

**please refrain from modifying the equipment**. If equipment is damaged, a fee may be assessed. -
If the room is locked upon arrival, please check in with the office in McGinley 204. A staff member will confirm your A/V needs, and will open the room for you. If the office is closed for any reason, please call the Building Manager cell phone. This phone is monitored at all times and will be responded to. Please be sure to leave your name, number and the event you are hosting/attending if the voicemail picks up.

-
Special needs for an event must be communicated as early as possible. Depending on the nature of the request, Campus Center Operations may be unable to provide the requested item due to lack of advance notice. This includes but is not limited to: A/V needs, rental furniture, additional seating or specific space needs.

-
Guests are able to park in the parking garage located near the main entrance. The current daily rate for parking is $25.00 per vehicle. Event sponsors are able to purchase parking vouchers as well.

-
Fordham University does not offer printing/copying services in-house on the day the event. All materials should be printed or copied prior to the start of the event.

-
Wireless internet is available throughout the campus. Please inform the staff though if you do require wireless internet access since it does require a username and password.

-
Normally overnight accommodations are not available on campus. However, there are several area hotels located within a short drive of Fordham University.
