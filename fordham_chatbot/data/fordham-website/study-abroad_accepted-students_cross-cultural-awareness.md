Immersing yourself in a new culture is a big part of your study abroad experience. Whereveryou go, you will encounter different challenges *and* opportunities, which may be unique to your [personal identity](/study-abroad/accepted-students/cross-cultural-awareness/personal-identity/) as you adjust to living in your new home.

Fordham's study abroad office and on-site staff at all of our programs are available [to help you adjust](/study-abroad/accepted-students/cross-cultural-awareness/culture-shock-and-adjustment/) and contextualize what you experience as you explore the world.
