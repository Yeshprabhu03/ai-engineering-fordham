Studying abroad allows you to develop cross-cultural communication skills, the ability to analyze and adjust to local customs and cultural contexts, flexibility, maturity, independence, and adaptability. In addition to the ability to learn another language, studying abroad forces you to deal constructively with cultural differences and situations you would have never faced otherwise. All of these skills are extremely valuable, as companies are increasingly searching for employees who can interact on a global scale. -
