## Global Teaching and Learning

### Study Abroad Course Proposals

The International & Study Abroad Programs Office works with full-time faculty to develop and implement summer courses in London or Rome or to introduce a short international travel component to a NY-based course in London, Granada, or another location. Study abroad courses must be based at a host institution which provides substantial local support to students and faculty engaged in the program. Host institutions should be able to provide medical and mental health services, 24 hour emergency contact, housing, and manage other emergency and basic logistical issues. The International & Study Abroad Programs Office works with partners around the world and can assist you in identifying a partner for your program if you do not have one already in mind. Study abroad courses should encourage and facilitate student engagement with the local culture and should complement the course being proposed. All proposed sites will be carefully vetted.

The proposal process for courses with an international travel component to be offered in 2026-2027 is a competitive process and will open online in the Fall and will remain open until April 1, 2026. Completed proposals will reviewed by the [Study Abroad Faculty Advisory Board](/study-abroad/faculty/study-abroad-council/) in Summer 2026. Please use the links below to submit your proposal:
