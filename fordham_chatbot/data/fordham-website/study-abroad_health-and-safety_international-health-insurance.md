*Fordham's Study Abroad insurance plan is for international use only and is active from the study abroad program start date until its end date. *[Fordham's SHIP Insurance](/student-life/safety-health-and-wellness/health-services/health-center/insurance/)* is for domestic use only and is not active while a student is participating in a semester-long program. Students who are enrolled in Fordham's SHIP Insurance while studying in NY should contact the student insurance office ( [email protected]) to determine any potential gaps in coverage between semesters.*
