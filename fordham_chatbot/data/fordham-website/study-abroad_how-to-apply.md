The study abroad application process varies by program but all the information you need can be found right here on our website and in the Study Abroad Portal. You can search for a program based on location, majors offered, housing type, language, and more on our [website here](http://fordham-ip.terradotta.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.AdvancedSearch).

Be sure to have a conversation with your advisers to plan out which courses you should take while abroad. Most core classes *cannot* be taken abroad unless you are enrolling at Fordham London or Fordham in Granada. In general, major and minor electives can be taken abroad, but other major and minor specific requirements cannot unless they are offered as Fordham classes in London or Granada. Each department sets a limit on the number of classes that can be taken abroad. Additional information regarding course credit transfer can be found [here](https://fordham-ip.terradotta.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=Abroad.ViewLink&Parent_ID=0&Link_ID=C64F8C45-5056-BA1F-738E3F132EE6D22B).

You should consult with your academic adviser and academic department to confirm what types of classes can be taken abroad in your chosen program. You may find the [Academic Planning Worksheet](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/study-abroad/pdfs/Academic-Planning-Worksheet-Final.pdf) helpful in developing your academic plan for study abroad.

**If you have any questions about the application process, please feel free to contact us or schedule an appointment online with a study abroad office staff member.**
