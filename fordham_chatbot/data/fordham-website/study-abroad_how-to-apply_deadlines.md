# Deadlines

![Students stand in front of countryside](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/study-abroad/Liam-.png)

**Most programs have limited space and can fill up before the published deadlines. We encourage all prospective applicants to apply during one of the priority periods listed below**. There are typically more spaces available for Fall programs, so we also recommend **applying to a program for the Fall term** when available.

*To give as many students as possible the opportunity to study abroad, you may be offered a place in your chosen program for a semester other than your preferred semester. If you have a strong preference for a particular semester or commitments in the US, you should complete your application by the Priority Deadline, but doing so does not guarantee acceptance to your chosen program in a particular semester.*

*We encourage students to not make housing commitments off-campus for the year they will be abroad prior to knowing the status of their study abroad applications. Fordham's Office of Residential Life provides the most flexibility for study abroad applicants for housing in NY.*

**Please note applications to study abroad during the 2025-2026 academic year closed on March 1, 2025.*
