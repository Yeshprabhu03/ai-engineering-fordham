# For Parents and Families

Studying abroad was a learning experience that could not be duplicated! Living with a family immersed in the culture, taking classes in Spanish, and traveling to many different countries was beyond what we expected! Studying abroad is more than learning in a classroom, it is a cultural immersion & a unique opportunity every Fordham student should take advantage of. - J. McCartin parent of Granada alumnus
