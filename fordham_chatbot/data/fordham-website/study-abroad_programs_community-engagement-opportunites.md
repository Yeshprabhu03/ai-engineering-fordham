# Community Engagement Opportunities

Throughout students' time studying abroad, there are also opportunities for students to get involved with the communities in which they are living. These opportunities help to enrich the study abroad experience for both the student and the communities.

Fordham University's International & Study Abroad Programs Office offers students the opportunity to participate in community engagement projects in [29 of the countries around the world](https://fordham-ip.terradotta.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.SearchResults&Program_Name=&Program_Type_ID=1&pi=%7F&pc=%7F&pr=%7F&pt=%7F&p_10002=%7F&p_10002_t=MULTI&p_10005=%7F&p_10005_t=MULTI&p_10006=%7F&p_10006_t=MULTI&p_10011=%7F&p_10011_t=MULTI&p_10012=%7F&p_10012_t=MULTI&p_10030=Service-Learning%7F&p_10030_t=MULTI&p_10031=&p_10031_t=YESNO&Sort=Program_Name&Order=asc&pp=10002%2C10005%2C10006%2C10011%2C10012%2C10030%2C10031) where we offer programs. Fordham's flagship programs based in London and Granada both offer the opportunity and encourage students to work with local community organizations.

By participating in community engagement opportunities while abroad, I felt like I belonged in a place that previously, was completely foreign to me. Participating in volunteer opportunities like at a local school and with an elderly foundation, allowed me to connect with locals on a deeper and more meaningful level. With these opportunities, I was able to call Granada, home.

Throughout students' time in London, there are opportunities for students to engage in the vibrant London community.

Students in London have the opportunity to take a one-credit seminar called "Community Organizing in London" that immerses students in the host community through project-based learning in partnership with local organizations. Students take seminars and workshops exploring theories of social justice and strategies for collective action as well as support a community change making platform through focused contributions to one of their initiatives. Students then present their projects and reflect on how they have impacted – and been impacted by – communities in London.

In the past, students have participated in volunteer opportunites and community engagement through the Carbon Accounting Project with the Liverpool Archdiocese, HandsOn "Giggle Bag" Decorating, and the Earthshot Prize Nomination Committee.
