# Booking Information

Fordham University would like to invite the community to engage with us and make use of our space. The Centre includes classrooms, administrative offices, a student lounge, an indoor event space and a roof terrace, and a number of smaller study spaces.

## Catering

The London Centre does not operate its own kitchen or catering facilities. The Centre works with a number of local caterers for special events & meetings; please contact in advance should you wish to arrange catering. There are plenty of nearby options for building users, including Leather Lane, across the street from the centre, which is an outdoor market with dozens of small trucks serving up a variety of street food.
