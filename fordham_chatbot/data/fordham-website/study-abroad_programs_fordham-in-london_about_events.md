This year's event will feature Cardinal Tim Radcliffe who will deliver a keynote address. In a seemingly ever polarized world, how do we engage with those with whom we disagree? Cardinal Radcliffe, the English theologian and Master Emeritus of the Order of Preachers, will engage attendees in the world of civic discourse. The conversation will be facilitated by John Annette, academic head at Fordham London and London Advisory Council member.
