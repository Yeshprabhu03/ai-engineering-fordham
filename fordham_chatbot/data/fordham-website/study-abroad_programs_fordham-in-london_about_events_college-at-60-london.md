Lectures will be an hour long followed by a 15 minute break. The group will then break into discussion groups for 30 minutes followed by a general discussion led by the lecturer.

**Lecture 1 - Friday, May 8: The History of British Politics and Government: An Introduction**We will consider the historical development of the United Kingdom from the Magna Carta to the present. We will examine the evolution of the United Kingdom including the Act of Union combining England and Wales with Scotland. The relationship with Ireland and the formation of Northern Ireland up to the present will also be considered. Finally, we will review the movement for ‘Devolution’ since the 1990’s, and we will make a comparison with the federal structure of the United States.

**Lecture 2 - Monday, May 11: The British Monarchy-Past and Present**We will consider the history of the British Monarchy from the Tudors to the present, highlighting the role of Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth I. In reviewing the history of the Stuart Monarchs, we will consider Charles I and the English Civil War and the ‘Glorious Revolution’ and the establishment of ‘Constitutional Monarchy. The Hanoverian Monarchs will be illustrated by the reign of Queen Victoria and the growth of the British Empire. Finally, we will review the House of Windsor in the reigns of Queen Elizabeth II and King Charles III with a guest appearance by Princess Diana.

**Lecture 3 - Tuesday, May 12: Parliamentary Sovereignty and the Unwritten Constitution**Following the 1688 ‘Glorious Revolution’, the Monarchy agreed to rule under the authority of Parliament, thus establishing ‘Parliamentary Sovereignty’. We will compare this concept with the United States Constitution and the separation of powers which ‘limits’ the authority of the President. Unlike the United States, the United Kingdom does not have a ‘Written Constitution’, but has a range of precedents from the Magna Carta to the present. The United Kingdom does not have a ‘Bill of Rights’, but agreed to accept the European Convention of Human Rights (1953), and with the Human Rights Act of 1995, this was incorporated into UK law. Today, the immigration crisis has led to a growing movement led by the Reform Party to leave the ECHR and repeal the HRA of 1995.

**Lecture 4 - Thursday, May 14: Foes, rivals, friends. The uneasy relationship between Britain and the EU.**Torn between a fading Special Relationship with the United States, its European identity, nostalgia for Empire and a sense of national exceptionalism, the United Kingdom is struggling to find its place in the world. The search for its modern political identity has led to convulsions that battered successive governments and wrecked the careers of numerous Prime Ministers since the 1950s. This roller-coaster ride reached its nadir, when the UK chose to leave the European Union: A decision that led to pandemonium in Westminster and ended in constitutional crisis. To the present day the ghosts of Brexit loom large and dictate the government's course.

**Lecture 5 - Thursday, May 14: Global Britain: Shakespeare's & Our's**This session explores how the monarchy's foreign policy, trade networks, and global exchange shaped Shakespeare’s remarkably diverse London. By tracing the migration of goods, people, and ideas from Shakespeare's time to today, we’ll consider how centuries of transnational movement continues to influence modern Britain - its culture, its politics, and its people.

**Lecture 6 - Friday, May 15: The Changing Special UK-USA Relationship**In 1946, Winston Churchill gave a speech in the context of post-WWII and the challenge posed by the Soviet Union and the ‘Iron Curtain’ in which he highlighted the need for unity between ‘English speaking peoples’ and argued for a special bond between the United States and the United Kingdom. This ‘special relationship’ was to maintain the ideals of liberal democracy and of human rights and the international rule of law. We will consider the changing nature of this relationship highlighting the relationships between Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, Tony Blair and Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, and finally the post-Brexit relationships with Donald Trump.

**How physically rigorous will this trip be?**This is a lightly to moderately strenuous program. Some excursions may require periods of walking or continued standing, such as during visits to museums or historic sites. Walking surfaces can be uneven given the historic nature of London, such as with cobblestone streets. Participants will primarily use the London underground (comparable to the NYC subway) to get around. All participants will be given an Oyster Card (London's version of NYC's MetroCard) which will enable them to access the underground and London's famous double-decker buses for the entire trip.

Fordham London is fully accessible, while the London underground is only partially accessible. Therefore, elevators and escalators may not be available at certain stations. However, accommodations for disabilities and medical conditions can be made by Fordham London staff if given appropriate notice.
