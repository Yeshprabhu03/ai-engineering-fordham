Marketing plays a unique role in the process of creating, communicating and delivering value to customers in a way that will preserve both environment and human capital. Sustainability issues affect businesses in many ways. While they may provide a new market niche or a product category for some, they may destroy a firm’s brand value and reputation.

We'll investigate all this innovation, through play texts, performances (live and recorded), and all the modes of writing (diaries, letters, autobiographies, reviews)by which spectators sought to preserve the evanescent but often spellbinding experience of going to a play.

*This course satisfies the Advanced Literature core requirement. It also counts towards the major-specific attribute ENHD at Fordham University.***ENGL 4015 – London Modernisms: 1890-1956: Unreal City**(Open only to Juniors enrolled in the London Liberal Arts program)

Modernist authors responded to a world in which scientific, technological, and medical advances, urbanisation, and armed conflict radically reconfigured and often violently reshaped the boundaries of culture, the nation-state, and the self. As a centre of global trade, cultural exchange, and imperial domination, London was a key crucible for the development and flourishing of a range of modernisms. In this course, we will bring together perspectives from literary criticism, critical and cultural theory, and intellectual and social history to explore the ways in which London responded to modernism and modernists responded to London. In doing so, we will consider how texts by authors such as Oscar Wilde, Joseph Conrad, George Bernard Shaw, Virginia Woolf, Elizabeth Bowen, and Samuel Selvon spoke to pressing contemporary debates around gender and sexuality, terrorism, immigration, imperialism, war, technology, and socioeconomic inequality.*This course satisfies the ICC core requirement at Fordham University.* -

A theoretical underpinning of the course is that Britain is one of the centers of a Black Atlantic, as understood through the works of Paul Gilroy. The course will open up social relations at the heart of Black British history, including class, gender, and sexuality.
