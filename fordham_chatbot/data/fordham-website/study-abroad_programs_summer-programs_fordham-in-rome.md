**VART 3500- Documentary Photography: Italy**Stephan Apicella-Hitchcock4 CreditsThis intensive four-credit class will introduce you to the basic and advanced techniques of image production with a major emphasis on generating documentary projects directly relating to the people, architecture, and culture of Italy. The cosmopolitan city of Rome, rich with artistic history, will serve as the source for our photographic explorations, as well as the catalyst for discussions addressing the historical significance of the documentary impulse. Our studies and production will take us from exhibitions in progressive contemporary art galleries, to the ancient architecture of the Colosseum as we utilize the wealth of visual stimuli as a resource, as well as a backdrop against which to critically discuss the strategies that documentarians utilize in communicating their interests.Please note that cameras are provided for the course.Each class produces a final book of compiled photography.

You will live in housing that is centrally located within Rome, in areas with shops and transportation and within reach of city attractions. Fordham University will bill participants a Program Fee that will cover the cost of housing during the program. Students are housed in shared student apartments which offer a walk or commute by public transport to classes. Students share twin or triple bedrooms and then share living areas with additional flatmates.

-
Participants will attend a pre-departure orientation with both Fordham faculty and study abroad administrators in preparation for their summer experience in Rome. Upon arrival, students attend an on-site orientation to introduce them to accommodations, culture and safety. Throughout the program, students will rarely be seen in the confines of the classroom, but instead, out and about exploring the richness of Roman life, art and culture through visits to historic sites, walking tours, and special excursions throughout the city.
