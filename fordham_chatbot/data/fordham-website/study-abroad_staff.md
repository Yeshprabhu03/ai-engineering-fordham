Study abroad at Fordham is part of a long-standing tradition of Jesuit education that seeks to enhance students’ understanding of the world’s peoples and their interdependence. Fordham prides itself in offering its students one of the most extensive networks for foreign study of any major university.

Full-time study abroad staff are trained in [Mental Health First Aid](https://www.mentalhealthfirstaid.org/) and basic First Aid, CPR, and AED use. Staff follow the standards of best practice established by the [Forum on Education Abroad](https://www.forumea.org/). Our goal is to help students gain an understanding of other cultures and to incorporate a global dimension to their chosen fields of study.

Please stop by our [offices](/study-abroad/contact-us/)—the ISAP staff looks forward to working with you and to offering the advising and services you will need to get the most out of your experience abroad.
