This course will teach some of the basic building blocks of an artistic practice, while also finding connections to the outside world through artwork. It will teach the students that art isn’t just an activity to perfect in the studio, but also a way to understand the world around us.

Skills/Learning Outcomes

Students will learn to:

- Understand the fundamentals of drawing, painting, sculpture, and photography.
- Appreciate how each medium allows different connections to the social, environmental, and personal world around them.
