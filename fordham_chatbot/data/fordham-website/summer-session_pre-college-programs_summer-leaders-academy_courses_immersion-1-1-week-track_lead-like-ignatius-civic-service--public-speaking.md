For intellectually curious students, this 5-day immersive course is an introduction to effective leadership styles, civic service, and articulate oral expression in the Jesuit educational tradition. Participating in topical discussions involving philosophy, law and ethics, “hands-on” community enrichment events, and a tailored public speaking training regimen (most notably our Capstone Showcase in the Fordham Law School courtroom), students learn how to lead with humanitarian purpose, moral substance and grit in today’s global world.

Skills/Learning Outcomes

Students will learn to:

- Critically understand and apply various ethical leadership styles and argumentative defenses
- Explore and assess leadership-in-action thinking patterns and habits of civil discourse
- Become a more self-aware, reflective leader who engages theory and practice
- Transform into a more comfortable and polished public speaker in daily life
- Learn the fundamental Ignatian “soft skills” that your future career profession expects
- Operationalize the Ignatian pedagogical paradigm (context, experience, reflection, action, evaluation) in distinct leadership scenarios
- Meet and learn from a diverse population of professionals while having fun in New York

Overall Takeaways

We will learn by using the trusted and successful 483-year-old Jesuit educational tradition of engaging the head (intellect/curiosity/imagination), heart (beliefs/convictions/values), and hands (operationalized leadership action on the ground level). Diverse career professions and vocations value this Ignatian charism of educating women and men for and with others since it works to align intellect, ethics, and public service for the betterment of society. It also provides you with important grounding and reflection in approaching college academic rigors and civic engagement.
