Step into the driver’s seat of tomorrow. In this immersive 5-day program, students will explore how today’s choices shape the world of the future — from emerging technologies and climate shifts to cultural change and innovation. Through a mix of interactive workshops, simulations, and collaborative design challenges, participants will learn how to think like futurists, using strategy, design, and systems thinking to imagine and build better futures.
