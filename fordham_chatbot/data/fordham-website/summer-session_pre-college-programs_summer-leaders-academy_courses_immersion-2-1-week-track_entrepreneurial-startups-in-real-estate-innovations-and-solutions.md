This course is designed to explain and explore entrepreneurship in the context of the business of real estate. Real estate entrepreneurs must frequently go beyond a transactional framework to build companies or investment platforms devising unique and industry changing “proptech” business ideas.

The course will introduce students to the personal skills, organizational challenges and market factors that influence the success or failure of an entrepreneurial business.

Coursework will in part entail working in teams to devise a business idea using concepts learned that will be presented to the class on the last day of the course.

Skills/Learning Outcomes

Students will learn to:

- Discuss examples of current entrepreneurs, their companies and their importance to both the local, national and global economies.
- Identify and evaluate the personal attributes and skills that characterize the “successful” entrepreneur, then comparing their personal characteristics and interests to that of the “successful” entrepreneur.
- Research and explain issues relevant to entrepreneurs.
- Recognize the financial, marketing, legal, human resource, operations and general management skills that are necessary to successfully launch and operate a successful new business.
- Understand the importance of a thorough business plan for a new real estate business product or service.

Overall Takeaways

At the conclusion of the course, students will have enhanced insight and skills to undertake an entrepreneurial real estate business either now or at some future point in their careers
