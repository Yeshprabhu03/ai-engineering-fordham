# FRESH Air: Hands-On STEM, Investigating Air Quality and Climate Impact in NYC

## July 6-10, 2026 Rose Hill

![](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/summer-session/Class-on-Keating-steps.jpg)

In this distinctive summer STEM program, led by Fordham Physics professor Stephen Holler, students participate in FRESH Air, a Fordham-based citizen science outreach project. During this course, students gain a deep understanding of the connections between climate change, air quality, and health impacts while working with sensors that measure pollution in the air around NYC. As part of this educational experience, students actively engage in constructing sensor platforms, fostering hands-on skills and knowledge that empower them to proactively address environmental concerns.

The goals of this program are for students to:

- Develop a deeper understanding of air quality, its effects on health, and its impact on the community.
- Explore the causes of air pollution and its sources, particularly in their neighborhoods.
- Gain practical experience in building and operating air quality sensor platforms.
- Enhance their knowledge of STEM principles, including microcontrollers and data analysis.
- Promote environmental awareness and a culture of inquiry within their communities.

Skills/Learning Outcomes

-
Students will actively engage in hands-on STEM activities aimed at understanding the principles of air quality monitoring, data collection, and analysis. This program allows students to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

-
Participants will have the opportunity to build sensor platforms. This hands-on approach will demystify the inner workings of air quality sensors, providing students with knowledge in microcontrollers, programming, and data analysis using Arduino-based kits.

-
Students will take their sensors around the campus and on field excursions to gain insights into the effects of external factors, such as pollution exposure and sources of indoor particulate matter, on air quality.

-
Students will learn about the immediate impact of poor air quality, particularly in the Bronx and Northern Manhattan communities, which are disproportionately affected by pollution. The program seeks to raise awareness of climate change and its connection to air quality, empowering students to effect positive change in their communities.


Overall Takeaways

Participating in the FRESH Air Program offers high school students several compelling benefits that can significantly enhance their college applications:

**STEM Skills and Knowledge:**The program equips students with practical skills in microcontroller programming, data analysis, and environmental science. This STEM-focused learning not only enhances their academic profile but also positions them as candidates who are well-prepared for college-level coursework.**Interdisciplinary Learning**: FRESH Air integrates knowledge from multiple disciplines, connecting science with environmental studies, community health, and social justice. This interdisciplinary approach reflects a student's ability to bridge gaps between different areas of study and think holistically.**Environmental Awareness**: The program's focus on climate change, air quality, and environmental impacts showcases a student's awareness of and concern for pressing global issues. Colleges value applicants who demonstrate an understanding of and passion for sustainability.
