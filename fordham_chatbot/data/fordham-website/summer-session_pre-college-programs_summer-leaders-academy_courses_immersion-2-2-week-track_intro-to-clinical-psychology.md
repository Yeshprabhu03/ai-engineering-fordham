![](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/summer-session/Summer-two-students-one-sitting-one-leaning.jpg)

This course provides an introduction to theory and practice within the field of clinical psychology. Through a combination of readings, lecture, discussion, experiential exercises, and site visits, we will cover the major theoretical approaches to conceptualizing and treating mental illness, while also learning about basic techniques used in the assessment, treatment, and prevention of psychological disorders. We will read about and discuss the most common professional roles adopted by clinical psychologists, and touch on key aspects of professional development and training for each of these roles. We will also discuss current challenges and debates within the field of clinical psychology, and consider the ways that the science and practice of psychology must change in order to meet the needs of diverse populations.

Instructor's Bio

Dr. Liz Raposa is a licensed clinical psychologist and Associate Professor in the Psychology Department at Fordham University. She received her B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania and her Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from the University of California, Los Angeles. Dr. Raposa’s research involves two related sets of questions designed to promote positive psychosocial and academic outcomes in stress-exposed youth. In one line of work, she examines the mechanisms that explain the negative impact of stressful life events on adolescents and young adults, and the ways in which supportive relationships can mitigate such negative outcomes. In another, Dr. Raposa designs and evaluates interventions that provide youth with social and emotional skills to better cope with stressors. Dr. Raposa teaches undergraduate courses on topics in clinical and community psychology (e.g., Psychopathology, Community Mental Health, Introduction to Clinical Psychology), as well as graduate-level courses in the Clinical Psychology program.
