Music Careers in NYC explores the intersection of music, personal goals, and professional opportunities in New York City. Students will engage with the vibrant musical landscape of Fordham and NYC, addressing social issues, diversity, and inclusion in the arts. The course offers insights into music marketing, nonprofit management, copyright law, and performance, while fostering creativity, critical thinking, and empathy through songwriting and improvisation. Participants will connect personal and professional aspirations with the dynamic arts communities in and around NYC.

Skills/Learning Outcomes

Students will:

- Explore how musicians and arts organizations at Fordham and in NYC are addressing social and political issues; promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion; building belonging and identity.
- Explore career opportunities in NYC and related course/extracurricular offerings at Fordham involving music marketing (including social media), nonprofit management and development, copyright and intellectual property law, music performance, and/or radio (recording/sound engineering, programming, broadcasting).
- Build capacities for critical thinking, creativity, and empathy through songwriting, song analysis, and/or musical improvisation, and by clearly articulating and connecting personal/professional goals to music and/or arts communities at Fordham and in NYC.

Students will build lasting connections with fellow high school students, current Fordham students, Fordham alumni, and NYC musicians. These connections and the topics they explore in this course can inform their college and career choices. Students will also learn to listen to, analyze, improvise, and write music in new ways in response to issues that matter to them and the communities they explore.
