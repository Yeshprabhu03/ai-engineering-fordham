# Intro to Fashion Design

## July 20-30, 2026 Rose Hill

![](/media/home/departments-centers-and-offices/summer-session/Summer__Time-Square_Cart.jpg)

This intensive fashion design immersion introduces students to the creative process, technical skills, and industry knowledge necessary to develop original design concepts from idea to illustration. Through hands-on projects, students will explore the fundamentals of silhouette, proportion, textiles, color theory, and visual storytelling while analyzing fashion’s cultural and

historical contexts. The course balances studio work, research, and critique with site visits to industry spaces and conversations with professionals. By the end, students will have created a mini-collection and a cohesive design portfolio that reflects their personal creative voice.

Skills/Learning Outcomes

**Upon completion of this program, students will be able to:**

- Develop and illustrate original fashion design concepts using industry-standard sketching and rendering techniques.
- Analyze and apply textile properties, color theory, and silhouette principles to create cohesive garment designs.
- Conduct visual and cultural research to inform design narratives and communicate them effectively through mood boards and concept presentations.
- Build a portfolio-ready design project, including a mini-collection, that reflects an understanding of design development from concept to presentation.

**Overall Takeaways**

Students will leave the program with a strong foundation in fashion design principles and hands-on experience in the design process, preparing them for further study or entry-level creative roles in the fashion industry. They will also gain valuable exposure to industry professionals and spaces, build a network of peers, and develop a portfolio that can support future academic or

professional applications.

Course Schedule

**Day 1 – Introduction to Fashion Design & Inspiration Research**

Overview of the fashion industry, the creative process, and how designers build collections from concept to runway. Students will discuss what makes a collection cohesive and begin exploring their own design themes.**Homework:** Draft a one-page collection concept statement outlining your central idea, inspiration, intended customer, and seasonal context. This will serve as the foundation for your final collection.

**Day 2 – Site Visit: Tailoring Black Style Exhibition at The Metropolitan Museum of Art**

Students visit Tailoring Black Style to study how designers use fashion as a vehicle for cultural storytelling, identity, and innovation. Class discussions will focus on translating historical and cultural narratives into contemporary design.**Homework:** Write a one-page inspiration analysis connecting what you observed at the exhibition to your own collection concept. Identify 2–3 key ideas, techniques, or silhouettes you want to explore in your designs.

**Day 3 – Textiles and Material Storytelling**

A hands-on workshop exploring how fabric choice shapes silhouette, structure, and mood. Students learn how to select materials that strengthen their design narrative and collection cohesion.**Homework:** Create a fabric story board for your collection, selecting 5–7 fabrics (real or sourced images) and annotating how each supports your concept. Include notes on texture, drape, and functional purpose.

**Day 4 – Color Theory and Mood Board Development**

Students examine color theory, psychological associations, and historical influences to build a strong visual identity for their collection.**Homework:** Finalize a mood board and color story for your collection. This should visually express the mood, tone, and message of your designs, including a palette of at least 6 colors and a written rationale for your choices.

**Day 5 – Design Development I: Concept Sketching and Direction**

Students begin translating their research, color story, and fabric ideas into preliminary sketches. Emphasis is placed on variety, experimentation, and connecting each design back to the concept.**Homework:** Create 6–8 rough sketches that represent the range of your proposed collection. Focus on silhouette, material use, and cohesion while experimenting with design details and variations.

**Day 6 – Design Development II: Refining the Collection**

Through peer critiques and one-on-one feedback, students refine their designs into a focused collection. Attention is given to narrative consistency, balance across looks, and practical considerations.**Homework:** Revise and refine your sketches into a 5-look cohesive mini-collection. Each look should include annotations describing its role within the collection (e.g., statement piece, foundational look, transitional piece).

**Day 7 – Portfolio Building & Visual Presentation**

Students learn how to professionally present their collections using industry-standard boards and layouts. The focus is on storytelling, visual clarity, and communication of design intent.**Homework:** Begin assembling your collection presentation boards including your concept statement, mood board, color story, fabric board, and refined sketches. Layout and presentation will be part of the final critique.

**Day 8 – Silhouette, Proportion, and Final Design Adjustments**

Students dive deeper into proportion and shape to ensure their collection’s visual language is cohesive and compelling. This session also covers final edits and finishing touches to design boards.**Homework:** Finalize silhouette exploration sheets for each look, demonstrating thoughtful decisions in shape, proportion, and detail. Adjust designs as needed to strengthen the overall narrative.

**Day 9 – Final Presentations and Critiques**

Students present their completed mini-collections to peers and guest critics. Presentations include research, concept statement, mood board, fabric story, sketches, final looks, and visual boards.**Homework:** Submit a final reflective statement (1–2 pages) discussing the evolution of your collection, what you learned about the design process, and how your voice as a designer developed through the course.
