![Student in archaeological fieldwork](/media/home/schools/school-of-professional-and-continuing-studies/Student-in-archaeological-fieldwork.jpeg)


In this 3-credit course, students explore archaeology and the ways artifacts illuminate major cultural developments. Through discussions of current practices and themes, the course provides a foundation in contemporary archaeological approaches.

Students gain a working understanding of material culture, archaeological sites, and the archaeological record. Emphasis is placed on both fieldwork and laboratory techniques, offering insight into the diverse methods, theories, and activities that define the archaeologist’s craft. Visits to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and hands-on activities analyzing artifacts provide opportunities to connect archaeological theory with real-world practice.

### Students will:

-
Understand the main concepts in the field of Archaeology and how it was developed.

-
Learn about different methods of fieldwork, analysis, and interpretation used in archaeological research.

-
Apply basic archaeological practices through brief experiences in fieldwork, experimental archaeology, and laboratory analysis.

- Develop and increase critical thinking skills.

Overall Takeaways

Students will learn how to think like archaeologists through the analysis of artifacts, replicas, and documentaries, developing a deeper understanding of the interpretation process of the past and learning to differentiate between scientific research and pseudo-archaeology.
