# Invitation to Theatre

![Students in circle](/media/home/schools/gabelli-school-of-business/gsb_gabelli_talk.jpg)

This college course is a joyful yet rigorous deep dive into ensemble-based creation, where the skills of the stage are directly translated into essential life skills. We use foundational theatre techniques—including dynamic devising, improvisation, and expressive work like clowning—to directly address two core areas:

-
Public Speaking & Confidence: By stepping into various roles and performing in a supportive environment, students will cultivate the self-assurance needed to speak persuasively in any setting.

-
Effective Collaboration: Theatre is the ultimate act of teamwork. Students will be challenged to build a true ensemble, learning to give and receive feedback constructively, negotiate creative choices, and work interdependently toward a shared artistic vision. You will develop the essential communication and listening skills required to be a valuable and dynamic team member both on and off the stage.


You will leave this course not only with a passion for performance but with heightened self-assurance and the ability to be a more dynamic, persuasive, and collaborative communicator for the rest of your academic and professional life.
