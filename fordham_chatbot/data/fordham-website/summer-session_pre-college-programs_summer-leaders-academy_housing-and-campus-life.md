## Old-School Beauty

Most programs and activities will take place on Fordham University's Rose Hill Campus in the Bronx. Just 8 miles north of our Lincoln Center Campus in the heart of Manhattan, it may not be what you’re expecting from New York City. The 85-acre campus is renowned for its Gothic architecture and is bordered by the lush New York Botanical Garden with the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo just across the street.

## Activities

In the late afternoons and weekends, students will have the opportunity to bond and prepare for their college and professional journeys.

Activities will include:

[Sessions on the college application process](/summer-session/pre-college-programs/summer-leaders-academy/courses/college-application-prep/)given by Fordham's Undergraduate Team.[Career exploration](/summer-session/pre-college-programs/summer-leaders-academy/courses/career-exploration/)through Fordham's Career Services office.- Making the most of Fordham's incredible new campus center and athletic facilities.

- Chaperoned off-campus excursions around New York City!

## Meals

[Ram Hospitality](https://fordham.campusdish.com/en/) offers several meal options each day at the Rose Hill and Lincoln Center campuses. Vegetarian and allergen-free foods are always available. Program tuition covers three meals per day for residents and lunches for commuters. Additional meals are available on a pay-as-you-go basis.

## Transportation

Fordham has a campus shuttle, the Ram Van, that provides reliable and safe transportation for students, staff, and faculty alike. Vans leave every half hour and are free to students taking class at another campus. Summer Leaders Academy participants who need to travel to Lincoln Center for class will be directed by program staff to the shuttles departing at 9:00 a.m. for Lincoln Center and 4:00 p.m. for the van back to Rose Hill.

The Ram Van will also provide free transportation throughout the session for off-campus excursions.
