# Summer Session Registration and Housing

## Instructions and NYC Housing

Planning and registering for summer classes and housing at Fordham is simple and convenient.

- Fordham Students can register for Summer classes in the same way that they do for fall and spring, through my.fordham.edu. Registration opens in late March.
- Visiting students are eligible to register through a
[special form](/summer-session/registration-and-housing/registration-for-visiting-students/)that will enable you to select and pay for your classes and apply for housing should you require it. - Keep in mind: tuition and housing charges are always separate, and lab fees are additional. Please refer to the
[tuition and fees page](/summer-session/registration-and-housing/tuition-and-fees/)for more information.
