# Summer Session Attendance and Late Registration

## Attendance

## Excused Absence

Summer Session involves intensive course study; each meeting is roughly equivalent to a week of classes during the regular academic year. It is expected that students register with the intention of attending all class meetings. Students who miss more than two meetings of a three-credit class and three meetings of a four-credit class will be encouraged to withdraw. Please see instructors' syllabi for policies regarding absence and final grades.

Late Registration

All students should be registered prior to the second class meeting and in no case may they register after the third class meeting. Any student who wishes to register after the second class must seek the instructor's written permission and forward it with his or her registration request to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a8dbddc5c5cddadbcbc0c7c7c4e8cec7daccc0c9c586cdccdd).
