## Approvals

### Visiting College Students

To ensure that credits earned over the summer at Fordham may be transferred, students matriculated at other colleges are encouraged to obtain written approval from their home school before registering. Once course work is completed and a grade is assigned, the student should request that an official transcript be sent to his/her home university. Please see the sub-section "Transcripts" at the [Policies and Procedures](/summer-session/registration-and-housing/policies-and-procedures/grades-and-records/) for instructions.

### High School Seniors

For high school seniors (and in exceptional cases, juniors) from accredited secondary schools: A transcript that reflects a GPA of 3.0 or higher is required along with a one-page expository writing sample. Sophomores/rising juniors should also provide a letter of recommendation from a teacher or guidance counselor. Please refer to our [Pre-College Program](/summer-session/pre-college-programs/) description for more details. Please note that approval to take a summer class does not imply admission to any school within the University.

### Non-Degree/ Non-Matriculated New Graduate Students

Graduate courses are open only to college graduates. Students who wish to take courses for enrichment, while making the decision to apply for admission, or while an application is pending must secure approval to take a course from the appropriate department or division offering the course. Submit the online application and send a copy of your transcripts to Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Admissions - Keating 216 or scan and email to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2b4d5e4c4a6b4d44594f434a46054e4f5e).

The application will be reviewed and the department will send their recommendations to the Admissions Office. Students will receive an email notification of the decision. All graduates of approved colleges and universities are eligible. Please call 718-817-4416 with questions.
