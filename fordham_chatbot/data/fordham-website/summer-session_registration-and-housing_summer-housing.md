# Summer Session Housing

## NYC Housing for Summer Session Students

**Visiting Students housing deadline: March 31, 2026**

Fordham University offers housing at both the Rose Hill (Bronx) and Lincoln Center (Manhattan) campuses for students who take courses at Fordham during the Summer Session. You are encouraged to apply for housing at the campus at which your course(s) will be held, but you are eligible to apply for housing at either campus, and each location has its own advantages.

**Housing at Lincoln Center, Manhattan** is in two- to three-bedroom apartments with kitchens and air-conditioning; these apartments are in McMahon Hall, which is right next to the Leon Lowenstein Building (where Lincoln Center campus classes are held). Lincoln Center housing puts you in the heart of Manhattan: it is very near the Columbus Circle subway station, Central Park, and a variety of cultural venues in this artistic area of the city.

**Below are the dates and for Summer 2026.**

**Session I**

Move-in: Sunday, May 24, Noon - 6 p.m.

Move-out: Friday, June 26, before 12 p.m.

**Session II**

Move-in: Monday, June 29, 6 p.m. - 9 p.m.

Move-out: Wednesday, August 5, before 12 p.m.

Cost: (2025 rate) $1,500 per 5-week session for double occupancy. The 2026 rate will be updated in January.

**Housing at Rose Hill, Bronx** offers more traditional college housing in air-conditioned rooms designed to accommodate two people. The residence halls here are set among large green lawns and tree-shaded walkways. A Fordham ID is required to enter the campus grounds, which include an Olympic-size indoor swimming pool, state-of-the-art gym facilities, tennis courts, and more. Rose Hill is also within walking distance of the Bronx Zoo, The New York Botanical Garden, the Metro-North Railroad, and the Fordham Rd. subway stations.

Please note that students staying for both sessions do not need to vacate between sessions.

## Applying for Housing

Applying for housing as a visiting student is a two-step process that involves the initial application and deposit, and then, once you are registered, the completion of an online survey through the student access portal. Before you apply, please take the time to review our Housing Eligibility requirements (below) to see if on-campus housing is right for you.

## Housing Eligibility

You are eligible to apply for on-campus housing during the summer if you meet the following criteria:

- You are a Fordham student.
- If you are a visiting student, you must be enrolled in, and attending, at least one live summer course per session at Fordham University (online only visiting students not eligible for housing). Attendance is verified regularly.
- If you are a visiting student, you must also be matriculated at an American University, or participating in an international program directly affiliated with Fordham University (i.e. IEB, UCSC, EDHEC).
- You are a student who has been admitted to the
[Summer Leaders Academy](/summer-session/pre-college-programs/summer-leaders-academy/).

If you have (or are planning to have) an internship in New York City and would like summer housing at Fordham University, we recommend that you explore our [NYC summer internship program](/summer-session/special-programs/new-york-city-summer-internship-seminar/); this program can offer you a great way to accomplish what you need, and more.
