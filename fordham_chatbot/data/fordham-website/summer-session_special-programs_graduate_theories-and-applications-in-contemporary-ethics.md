# Theories and Applications in Contemporary Ethics Summer Session

This intensive, three-day, graduate-level course is designed to provide cross-disciplinary perspectives on moral theory and applied ethics. Using a team-teaching approach, this course brings together faculty from at least six different disciplines to provide foundational knowledge about moral theory with contemporary applications. In addition to seminars on foundations in moral philosophy, moral theology, and moral psychology, the course features lectures and case discussions on issues of current social importance. Previously, students have focused on the following topics: decisions at the end of life, economic social justice, and responsibility in conducting research with vulnerable populations. Course requirements include a mastery of the reading materials, active participation, and topic-oriented thought papers during the three-day workshop. In addition, successful completion of the course requires a post-workshop paper summarizing the integration of course material into the students’ graduate work.
