# Visiting Student Summer Interns

## Fordham can help with your internship search!


Are you looking for a unique NY internship experience this summer but don't know where to start?

It can be difficult for students whose universities are not part of the metro area to begin their summer internship searches in NY. Fordham's Career Center staff helps more than 81% of our students secure at least one internship before they graduate. We've cultivated relationships with NY employers for decades through our alumni and our employer relations staff.

Through the Summer in the City NY Internship Program, visiting students have the opportunity to:

- work one-on-one with a Fordham Career Center Advisor to polish their cover letter and resume.
- gain access to Fordham's database of select internship opportunities in NYC and beyond.
- receive interview coaching to clinch an internship offer.
- receive the college credit that unpaid internships require.

Because of the speakers, class exercises, and Highlands Ability Battery Test, I was able to get a hold of how I best handle situations, my strengths and weaknesses, and how to analyze other people's talents.
