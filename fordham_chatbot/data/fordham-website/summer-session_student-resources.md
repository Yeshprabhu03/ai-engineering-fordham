**Tutoring Services**

Students are encouraged to take advantage of free tutoring available to support their success at Fordham. These services are offered at no charge to students. All undergraduates have access to free peer-to-peer tutoring for almost every class through the [Knack](/fordham-college-at-rose-hill/student-resources/tutoring-services/) tutoring platform. Academic support and tutoring are also available from select departments and the Fordham Writing Center. More information below.

-
Knack is a free platform that connects students with a trained Fordham peer tutor. Through the platform, you and a tutor will set a time to meet in person or online. Tutoring is for everyone! And if you’d like to earn money and gain experience while also helping other Fordham students, sign up to serve as a tutor by visiting the Knack site.

-
The Economics tutoring center is open to students enrolled in Basic Microeconomics, Basic Macroeconomics, Statistics I and Statistical Decision Making. This link will be available in June.

The Language Learning Center is a state-of-the-art multi-use, interactive digital facility where students can complete their assignments and practice their language.

Providing more than a proofreading service, tutors will work with you on a variety of logical, rhetorical, and grammatical concerns in your writing. They can assist you with any type of writing from conception, to composition, to completion. The aim is not only to help you perfect an individual essay but to help you develop the skills you need to become a better writer.

Please call 718-817-4032 at Rose Hill or 212-636-6417 at Lincoln Center if you have any questions. For general information, visit the

**Health Services/Counseling**University Health Services provides accessible and high-quality health care services to Fordham University Students. It is our goal that students will develop an understanding of dealing with their own health, both physical and mental. We provide education to students with the expectation that this knowledge will enable them to live healthy lifestyles, promote wellness, and enable them to achieve academically, spiritually, and socially. Our medical team recognizes and welcomes the uniqueness of our students and we respect human diversity in all its forms. We are members of the Ally Network of Support and we are committed to providing an inclusive environment for all. We assist our students in developing moral and ethical values and characteristics that reflect the Jesuit tradition in regard to health promotion and illness prevention.
