Therefore, this class is designed to introduce you to the principles of management as both a body of knowledge and a personal practice. You will deepen your knowledge about organizational behavior, and you will learn what you can do personally to improve your own effectiveness as a teammate, employee, and leader. An overarching theme of the course is self-awareness. Throughout the entire course, you will engage in self-reflection, mindfulness practices, and interactive teamwork in order to become an effective change agent in your journey to human excellence.
