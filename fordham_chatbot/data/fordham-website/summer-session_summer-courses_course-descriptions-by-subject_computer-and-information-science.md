With the exponential growth of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, the forensic examination and security of these objects has garnered increased attention. Moreover, digital forensic examiners have been presented with a unique set of challenges in order to understand how such devices secure, store and process data. This course is structured utilizing modules which will provide students with extensive hands experience in an interactive lab environment that will delve into the issues in IoT forensics and security. Through experimental testing participants will investigate and review the security of home IoT devices. The testing will include: traffic capture, device scanning and the analysis of wireless signals. In addition, a review and analysis of privacy exposure will be conducted, outlining the security vectors and malware used to attack and control IoT devices. Subsequent modules will be comprised of explanation, theory and numerous hands on exercises, culminating in discussion regarding the IoT technology stack and how it impacts digital forensics. Through use of existing digital forensic tools and methodology, we will introduce students to the application of digital forensics in the IoT framework by examining ordinary home devices. Examinations will provide students with hands on experience into a hunt for artifacts, identifying formats of stored data, encoding methods, while documenting their efforts throughout the process. Respective analysis of collection techniques, device workflow and the object data repositories will provide participants with an understanding of the full forensic value of these devices.
