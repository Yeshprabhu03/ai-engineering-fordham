**ENGL-2000-L11- Texts and Contexts: Climate Fiction and The Politics of the Future ***Summer Session 1: May 26, 2026 - June 25, 2026L - Lincoln Center: TWR, 01:00PM - 04:00PM*

Climate change is one of the defining challenges of our time. In the wake of accelerating natural and human-made disasters, a powerful body of cultural work has emerged, often described as climate fiction, or cli-fi. Situating these texts within the environmental humanities, this course bridges science, culture, and social justice to examine how environmental crises are narrated, historicized, and politicized. Through close analysis of narrative form and storytelling conventions, we will explore how climate fiction draws on both history and the present to imagine utopian, dystopian, and apocalyptic or post-apocalyptic futures.

Central questions of the course include the ethical, political, and cultural implications of these narratives; how issues of race, class, disability, indigeneity, and global inequality shape representations of environmental crises; and what possibilities for responsibility, resistance, and collective futures these texts reveal. Some readings and viewings may include creative works by Abi Daré, Lily Brooks-Dalton, and Téa Obreht, as well as documentaries such as Lowland Kids, and scholarly writing by Amitav Ghosh, Chase Hobbs-Morgan, Rob Nixon, and Kim Stanley Robinson.

**ENGL-3222-V21- Shakespeare & Popular Culture***Summer Session 2: June 30, 2026 - August 04, 2026V - Virtual (online courses only): MTWR, 01:00PM - 04:00PM*

Shakespeare: the name is now associated with high, even elitist, art, so it's easy to forget that he was mostly writing for a medium of popular entertainment: the public theater. In this course, we'll consider Shakespeare as popular culture in his own day alongside reimaginings of Shakespeare in popular culture today, including films, television series, music, graphic novels, YouTube and TikTok videos, and more. Throughout, we'll consider how and why he came to be a global icon and why many of the myths and cliches surrounding his work fail to do justice to the nuances and complexities of both Shakespeare and popular culture.
