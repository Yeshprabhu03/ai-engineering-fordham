**ANTH-1200-V21- Introduction to Biological Anthropology***Summer Session 2, July 01, 2025 - August 05, 2025Online: MTW, 06:00PM - 09:00PM*

This introduction to biological anthropology satisfies a core life science requirement and serves as a general survey of the biological focus of anthropology. The course summarizes the different subdisciplines of biological anthropology and covers the history of evolutionary theories, human genetics and adaptation, primate biology, behavioral ecology and conservation, and an overview of the human fossil record. In particular, we emphasize the variations found in contemporary humans and non-human primates and the biological and cultural changes that took place in our ancestors over the past 7 million years. Lab sessions will provide a practical introduction to human osteology, primate morphology, primate conservation, and comparisons of human fossil morphology.

**ENST-4900-V21- Internship: Environmental Communications and Media***Summer Session 2: June 30, 2026 - August 04, 2026V - Virtual (online courses only): , - *

Students will intern in a communications and media organization that deals with environmental issues, or in the communications and media office of an environmental organization, government agency, business, or other entity in order to gain hands-on learning in the emerging field of environmental communications. This kind of hands-on learning and professional experience is normally highly valued by both future employers and graduate school programs. The instructor supports students in their efforts to find an internship placement that meets their interests and needs and advises them throughout the semester on how to derive the maximum amount of value from the experience. Students will learn critical skills in communications and media (e.g., public speaking, public relations, social media marketing, etc.) that will aid them throughout their internship. A sample listing of current internships can be found on the Environmental Studies website, under Internships. Note:
