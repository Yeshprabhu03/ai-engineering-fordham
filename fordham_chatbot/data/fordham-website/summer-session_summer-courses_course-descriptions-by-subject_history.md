The United States became involved in French-Indo-China in 1950 and left Vietnam in 1975. This course asks basic questions about the Vietnam Wars. Why did the United States make such a vast commitment in an area of so little importance? What did it attempt to do during the quarter century of it involvement there? Why, despite the expenditure of more than $150 billion dollars and the loss of more than 58,000 lives did the world's most powerful nation fail to achieve it objectives? What have been the consequences for Americans, Vietnamese, and others of the long and divisive war?

**HIST-3928-V31- History of Asian American Communities***Summer Session 3: May 26, 2026 - Aug 4, 2026V - Virtual (online courses only): asynchronous*

This course explores the pivotal role of Asian American community-building at the intersection of American history and the history of global diaspora. In this complex mix of local and international dynamics, immigrants from Asia to the U.S. labored to find their footing in a shifting nation while grappling with new questions of identity and belonging. These struggles created an emerging and often challenging notion of "Asian America" that left an indelible imprint on U.S. politics, the legal system, art and culture, urbanization, education, and the ongoing struggle for gender and racial justice. Through a series of case studies and a community-based research project, our course will examine the ways that the rich and entangled histories of East Asians, Southeast Asians, South Asians, and Pacific Islanders have shaped some of the most important narratives of the past two centuries.

**HIST-4009-V11- Film, Fiction, Power***Summer Session 1: May 26, 2026 - June 25, 2026V - Virtual (online courses only): MTWR, 06:00PM - 09:00PM*

Visual and written representations of American power have influenced, challenged and even transformed U.S. relations in the world. With their capacity to reach millions, films and fiction do more than tell stories or entertain audiences. They also have the unparalled means to shape values and beliefs, and to convey attitudes toward the nature and practice of American power. What sort of themes of international power did authors, screen-writers, and directors address in the twentieth century? What do these reflections on power reveal about American society, its politics, and its place in the world?

**HIST-4105-L21- The Early Modern World: Art & Science***Summer Session 2: June 30, 2026 - August 04, 2026YL - Hybrid LC/Online: TR, 09:00AM - 01:00PM*

European exploration and interaction in the 16th and 17th centuries expanded the horizons not only of the Europeans but of the entire world. It was also the beginning of a truly global system of exchange involving peoples, products, money, and microbes that in turned transformed European art, philosophy, religion, and science. This interdisciplinary capstone will analyze the dizzying world of early modernity through consideration of the way its scientists, artists and religious thinkers understood their society and treated the materials of their disciplines. We will trace first the economic and human consequences of this newly global system, for Europeans and non-Europeans alike, and we will then explore questions proper to each discipline at the time, the changes they underwent, as the ways that new interactions and discoveries shocked and exploded ancient traditions and authority, and how the approaches of the period compare to contemporary methods in each area.

**HIST-4591-V11- Race, Sex, and Colonialism***Summer Session 1: May 26, 2026 - June 25, 2026V - Virtual (online courses only): MTWR, 01:00PM - 04:00PM*

In this Senior Values seminar, we will explore how race, sex, and gender were constructed, regulated, and contested in colonial contexts, highlighting both similarities and differences across these colonial experiences. The course will focus on one or more of the following regions during their colonial periods: Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Close attention will be paid to the methodological approaches our authors take and to the theoretical insights we can draw from our diverse case studies to help us better discern the common and singular threads running through this expansive field of inquiry. Case studies will be accompanied by foundational theoretical readings on race, colonialism, and sexuality. Weekly class presentations and revision writing will be a fundamental part of achieving eloquence in speaking and writing during the course of the semester. Note:

**HIST-5424-V11- Women in Science & Technology***SG1 - GAS Summer Session 1 MAY 26, 2026 - JUN 25, 2026V - Virtual (online courses only): , TBA - TBA*

Natural knowledge and the manipulation of nature have often been gendered, but how, why, and by whom? This seminar will explore the multitude of ways that women have shaped and been shaped by these gendered visions of nature and the tools for controlling it. What forms of natural knowledge were deemed appropriate for women? Why were women understood to be particularly adept at specific technologies or handicrafts? How were spaces for scientific practice or technological production rendered hospitable or, more often, inhospitable for women? In what ways have systems of scientific authority limited or encouraged the participation of female researchers? How have science and technology been used to act on women's bodies? Are there specifically "womanly" ways of knowing? These and other questions will be explored through cases across a wide range of periods, disciplines, and geographies, allowing us not only to question the shifting place of women within the worlds of science and technology but also to question our assumptions about the place of science and technology within different societies.
