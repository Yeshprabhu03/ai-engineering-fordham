This graduate seminar offers an introduction to the Old French language through an in-depth study of a literary work. We will explore that work both linguistically and materially, including its paleographical and codicological contexts. Through our systematic study of Old French grammar, syntax, and vocabulary, students will also gain proficiency in reading texts from a variety of genres, whether literary, historical, or documentary. No prior knowledge of Modern French or Latin is required. Graduate students from any disciplinary background interested in the Francophone Middle Ages are welcome. Note:
