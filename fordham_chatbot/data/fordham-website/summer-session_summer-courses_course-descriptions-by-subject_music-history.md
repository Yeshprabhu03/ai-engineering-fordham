**MUSC-1100-V11- Introduction to Music History***Summer Session 1: May 26, 2026 - June 25, 2026V - Virtual (online courses only): TWR, 09:00AM - 12:00PM*

This course presents a survey of music history, with a focus on developing the skills of thinking and writing critically about music. Students will learn to listen in a focused way and relate what they hear to issues of musical “meaning” and general culture. Students will learn some technical vocabulary that will help them describe or advocate for any music they encounter, and they will apply this vocabulary to examples throughout the semester, for instance a Beethoven Symphony or a Duke Ellington jazz arrangement. Sections may have different focuses in terms of geography or chronology.
