**DTEM-1402-R11- Digital Cultures***Summer Session 1: May 26, 2026 - June 25, 2026YR - Hybrid RH/Online: TR, 09:00AM - 12:00PM*

This course will examine the interplay between digital environments and the culture(s) they both stem from and shape. It will give special attention to the ways digital and networked spaces relate to lived experiences on- and offline, organize social relationships, shape values and norms, engage individuals in participatory modes of cultural production, and impact culture on an individual, group, and trans-national scale. Students will investigate the culture(s) (social norms, language, practices of inclusion and exclusion, etc.) of individual digital platforms and learn about cultural norms that span the digital world more broadly. We will also critically engage with whether and how those qualities might also impact the offline experience of various communities or groups, such as those based on race, gender, class, abilities, or affiliation with various subcultures or values.

**DTEM-2411-R11- Digital Research Methods***Summer Session 1: May 26, 2026 - June 25, 2026YR - Hybrid RH/Online: MW, 09:00AM - 12:00PM*

(Formerly COMM 4710): Digital technologies affect every area of social life, from personal identity, to interaction with others, to broad social and political arenas. Digital technologies have also deeply impacted scholarship and research in the humanities and the social sciences. How can we investigate the impacts of digital technologies accurately? How do academics and industry professionals use social media, “big data,” and the like to answer puzzling questions? This course provides an overview of and hands-on approach to contemporary digital research methods, including ethnography, interviews, focus groups, metrics and analytics, and polling and surveys. Students will become familiar with basic research methods used in both academic and professional contexts.

**DTEM-3500-V21- Resistance and Global Activism***Summer Session 2: June 30, 2026 - August 04, 2026V - Virtual (online courses only): TWR, 09:00AM - 12:00PM*

This course studies the proliferation, and implications, of digital technology in political resistance. The goal is to provide students with analytical tools and skills for understanding the strengths and weaknesses of contemporary digital resistance. The course’s perspective is on the resistance played out in the “everyday life” of “ordinary” people: a resistance that might be widespread and diffused, individual or small scale, implicitly political, disguised, or even hidden. It brings to light how the “private” or “personal” can be political and explores the creativity of “cultural resistance.” Particular interest will be paid to studying new sources of power and their ability to subvert or censor acts of digital resistance. By taking this course, the participants will gain a sophisticated understanding of the role played by technology, and technology providers, in the performance of and resistance to power. Course participants will develop a critical understanding of the nature of technology and its implications for local, regional, and global justice. Note:

**NMDD-3020-L11- Digital Storytelling***Summer Session 1: May 26, 2026 - June 25, 2026L - Lincoln Center: MW, 09:00AM - 01:00PM*

This class explores storytelling in emerging platforms. From the still image, the soundscape, and film, we will evolve to discuss game design and interactive storytelling. The practice of game narratives is a new aspect of writing for digital media that helps to bridge storytelling formats from television and film with interactive experiences on our computers or phones. Integrated workshops in cinematography, sound and video editing, and game design via Twine will enable students to create story projects of their own. Note:
