The function of the director is demonstrated by analyzing multiple stagings of the same text; each student will direct a scene. The actor is a primary element of theatre; each student will act a scene. We will explore the role of the designer who creates the physical world of the play; each student will conceive a design. Interwoven with the production elements will be a survey of theatre history focusing on Greek, Elizabethan, contemporary and global theatre. Students will attend live performances of plays.
