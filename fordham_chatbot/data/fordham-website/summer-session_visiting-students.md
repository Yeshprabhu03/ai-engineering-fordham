![Female Student Peers over Text Book](/media/review/content-assets/migrated/images/201413_Fordham_Fall_2014_1432.jpg)


Each summer, Fordham welcomes hundreds of visiting students who attend colleges and universities throughout the United States and overseas.

Some of these students call New York City or the tri-state area home. Others come to visit us just for the summer. Fordham welcomes and appreciates these students.

Fordham offers classes that meet regularly online or in-person for five weeks and online classes that meet for 10 weeks asynchronously. Find day or evening options at two NYC campuses and online.
