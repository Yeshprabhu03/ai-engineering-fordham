# Summer Session International Students

## Spend Summer in a City You Will Love

Fordham Summer Session is eager to welcome visiting international students into its undergraduate classes at our two New York City campuses. With museums, entertainment, nightlife, and public transportation, NYC is student friendly and a desirable destination for any international traveller.

## Why Fordham?

Hear more about Fordham from some of our international students!


## International Students

International students from universities outside of the U.S. that are not Fordham partners are welcome to take classes at Fordham. Please be advised, however, that Fordham does not issue an I-20 for a student visa in this case since the study is less than full time. Students should work with their embassy on identifying the proper travel documents. Students from certain countries may be eligible come to Fordham as [tourists with a passport](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html).

## International Students from Partner Institutions

Students from partner institutions should review the information on the appropriate program page and work with their home school to learn about program costs and payment.

## Language Requirement

Students who wish to take Fordham Summer Session undergraduate classes should achieve an English proficiency of B2 in the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). This is equivalent to TOEFL 80 or IELTS 6. If you have not yet achieved this level of proficiency and you are looking to improve your English this summer, please consider Fordham's [ESL Summer Institute](/academics/academic-resources/esl/esl-courses/).
