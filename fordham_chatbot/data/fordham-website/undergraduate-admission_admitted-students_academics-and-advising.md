## Fordham College at Lincoln Center (FCLC)

Located on our Lincoln Center campus, FCLC is a tight-knit liberal arts college that will provide you with the advantages of a major university in the heart of New York City.

FCLC students are citizens of the world. They are creative, innovative, and plugged-in, equally at home in the arts, humanities, natural sciences, and social sciences. They have access to caring professors at the top of their fields and world-class facilities on campus, and to the culture, innovation, and spark of the city. It's a college community that hums with the energy of a metropolis while providing a nurturing home base for your college journey.

## Fordham College at Rose Hill (FCRH)

FCRH is a thriving liberal arts college located on the Rose Hill campus in the Bronx—85 green and Gothic acres just across the street from the New York Botanical Garden and the Bronx Zoo.

Students at FCRH are intentional about engaging with diverse ideas, people, and communities. About the Jesuit mission of caring for the whole person. And about supporting students as they better themselves—and the world around them. They study on a traditional college campus with a modern point of view: that by enriching students—mind, body, and soul—you support not just learners but knowledge creators.

They have access to the biggest names in business—in New York City and across the world. And Gabelli's dual business and liberal arts core pushes students to become well-rounded professionals and global citizens. At the Gabelli School, you can find your own path to becoming a changemaker.
