## Financing Your Future

Fordham University is committed to keeping college affordable. Founded as a college to serve immigrants in New York City, Fordham possesses a mission that calls us to serve those who could not afford to attend the University without financial assistance. We will do all we can to assist you in this process. As an admitted student, the following links and information will help you finalize your financial aid package, apply for loans and plan for the future.

We do not underestimate the responsibility that accompanies affording higher education. To assist you, we have created a [Financing Your Fordham Education page](/student-financial-services/undergraduate-financial-aid/) which provides guidance on how to develop a plan to manage the cost of attending a four-year university. A key component to developing your plan will be the [Financing Fordham Worksheet](https://myapps.web.fordham.edu/ptl/financial_aid/scholarship_forms/checklist/checklist_calculator.jsp?_ga=2.10794292.1010799906.1670854689-539978480.1666098408). Use the worksheet to design a plan that is right for you.
