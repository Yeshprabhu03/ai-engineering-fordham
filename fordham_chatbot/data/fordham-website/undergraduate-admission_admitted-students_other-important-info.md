# Other Important Info

Did we miss something? Hopefully you’ll find it in this section. If you haven’t checked out our Next Steps page yet, we certainly encourage you to do that first! Otherwise, take a look here for a list of important dates, information about technology support on and off campus, and more.

If you still can’t find what you’re looking for, please connect with your admission counselor. We’re here to help!
