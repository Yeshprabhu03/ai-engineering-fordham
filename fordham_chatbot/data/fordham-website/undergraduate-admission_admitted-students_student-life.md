# Student Life

No matter where you study, being a Fordham student is about more than just taking classes. It’s about a diverse community that is here to support and challenge you as a person beyond the classroom. Whether you’re a commuter or a resident, based at Lincoln Center or Rose Hill, you’re sure to find a place at Fordham—and in New York City.
