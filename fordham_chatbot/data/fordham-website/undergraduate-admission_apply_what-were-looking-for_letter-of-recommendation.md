# Letter of Recommendation

We prefer that your primary letter come from an academic source. These teachers or counselors can best speak to how you navigate an academic environment (no matter what that environment looks like!). They can also speak to your character as a citizen of your school community. If, however, you would like to submit additional letters, please know we will consider them as part of your application's review.
