# Essay Guidelines

We see the essay as the most personal component of the applications we read. As a writing sample, it tells us several important things about you.

## Who You Are?

The essay gives us insight into who you are as a person. Be self-reflective and let your own voice speak clearly through it. We want to get to know you better and determine if you are a good match for our community.

## How Well Do You Write?

Make sure your essay is well written and free of grammatical errors, typos, and other mistakes. It should demonstrate that you are ready to produce college-level compositions. At Fordham, writing and communication skills are essential, and our cornerstone *Eloquentia Perfecta* courses help you develop these skills.

## Are You a Critical Thinker?

You will choose from a series of essay prompts in the application. How thoughtfully and logically you answer the questions in your essay tells us how ready you are for complex analysis and argument at the college level.
