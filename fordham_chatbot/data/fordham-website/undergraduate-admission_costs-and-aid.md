# An Investment That Pays Off

College is a huge choice. It’s probably the biggest commitment of time, energy, and money that you’ve ever made, but graduates with four-year degrees earn nearly twice as much as non-grads, according to *The New York Times*.

And a Fordham education doesn’t just help you navigate today’s challenges. It will help you learn to anticipate what’s next. We’re here to help you take advantage of these undeniable advantages.
