Can a conversation about civil rights in America be more inclusive? Of course. But we aim much higher. The discourse in African & African American Studies at Fordham has been rich, diverse, and complex for more than four decades. Founded in 1969, we’re one of oldest academic departments in the U.S. devoted to exploring the breadth and depth of the African diaspora experience in America and around the globe.

African & African American Studies embraces diverse intellectual and ideological perspectives in researching, teaching, and civic engagement. It’s an interdisciplinary field, pulling from history, literature, language, sociology, economics, and the arts. It’s deeply eclectic and intellectually exhilarating.

Study civil rights and citizenship. Begin to speak Swahili. Analyze the role of race in the black prison experience. Examine the role of women in African politics. Read contemporary African literature. Parse African American identity in film. Learn the 19th-century roots of South African apartheid.

And join a department of diverse community of students and faculty in small, interactive classes where learning is a conversation, not a lecture.

Of course, you’ll learn more than African & African American studies here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, economics, mathematics, languages, science, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

We sponsor a wide range of cultural programs, lectures, conferences, and community events throughout the year. Students lead an annual symposium based on course-related research. These debates help you sharpen your mind, back your ideas with facts and interpretations that express your thoughts clearly.

The Bronx African-American History Project reveals the untold stories of the people living in the diaspora all around us. You’ll document the histories of more than 500,000 Bronx residents of African descent with roots in the U.S. South, West Indies, and Africa. Our research focuses on jazz history, the roots of hip-hop, and Caribbean and African immigration.

Do you speak our language? We mean that literally. Be prepared to learn a foreign language relevant to the study of Africa, such as French, Swahili, and Arabic.

Maybe you’ll travel to learn it. We urge African & African American Studies majors at Fordham to study abroad during junior year to gain extraordinary perspective and firsthand life experience. There’s nothing like immersing yourself in another country for gaining invaluable understanding of its people, history and politics.
