Sciences and the humanities team up in anthropology. This interdisciplinary approach is essential to understanding the origins of our species millions of years ago and the development of ancient cultures, but it is equally important for understanding our present living conditions with high levels of inequality and discrimination.

Therefore you will learn about the past of our species but you’ll also put a wide lens on contemporary problems around the globe: how we live and die, make art and start wars.

Anthropology at Fordham offers a global perspective and the opportunity to understand the nuances of human societies. That’s a distinct advantage in our complex world.

Of course, you’ll learn more than anthropology here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, economics, mathematics, languages, science, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.
