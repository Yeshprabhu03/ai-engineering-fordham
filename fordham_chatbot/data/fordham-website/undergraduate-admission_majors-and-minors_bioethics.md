Study the ethical complexities of the medical and scientific worlds.

In the modern age, astonishing medical and scientific advances are accompanied by challenging moral and ethical dilemmas. The bioethics minor at Fordham applies the insights of ethics directly to medical and scientific research, policy, and practice.

Administered by Fordham’s Center for Ethics Education, this multidisciplinary minor introduces students to critical moral questions and informed ethical decision-making on issues related to individual, public, and global health; professional health care decision-making; and health policy. You’ll look at big questions.

- When does life begin and when does life end?
- How do we devise research methods that are both scientifically and ethically valid?
- What are our moral obligations to vulnerable populations?
- How do we balance individual autonomy with larger public health concerns?
- How do we ensure that health care resources are distributed fairly?

You’ll explore these questions from a multidisciplinary perspective, including classes in the humanities and sciences, and through lectures with leading internationally renowned ethicists.

Of course, you’ll learn more than bioethics here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, economics, mathematics, languages, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.
