The Gabelli School of Business is considered one of the top business schools in the U.S. for a reason. (For a lot of reasons.) Our dual core curriculum—half business, half liberal arts—makes Fordham business graduates unique: knowledgeable about global commerce, but also keenly aware of the human factor in every deal.

You will study with business leaders and moral thinkers. Global content is woven into each course.

Our business classes will have you managing $1 million of Fordham’s money, importing and marketing artisanal goods from Africa, and traveling to other continents to meet the people behind the supply chain.

Our liberal arts classes will have you studying the philosophy of St. Augustine, English classics, and the fine arts.

College is your time to develop a portfolio of professional and personal assets. The professional: knowledge, skills, and experience highly valued in our global economy. The personal: strong values, self-awareness, concern for others, and an inner drive for excellence that will serve you throughout life.

We prepare you to take a leading role in business—and have a fulfilling life outside of work.
