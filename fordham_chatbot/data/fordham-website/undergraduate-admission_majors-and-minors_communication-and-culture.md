As human beings, we have a natural drive to communicate. But do we understand the true impact of what we say and how we say it?

Advances in media technology always influence the way we communicate; but even as things change, fundamental aspects of communication and culture remain the same.

The Communication and Culture program at Fordham takes an interdisciplinary approach to the study of human and mediated communication. Drawing from both the humanities and the social sciences, you’ll explore the many ways in which communication both shapes and reflects the human experience.

Combining theory and practice, our program builds a bridge between academic concepts and everyday situations. You’ll learn the strategic application of communication theory, tools and techniques.. You’ll examine the powerful economic and political role of the media in today’s world. And you’ll reflect upon the great responsibility that comes with the power of mediated communication.

Our faculty members are a dynamic mix of media scholars and industry leaders who serve as models of critical dialogue. We emphasize values and ethics in various settings, including public interest, government, NGO, and corporate cultures.

But you’ll learn more than communications here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, history, mathematics, languages, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.
