Study how writing leads to a creative career and life.

The creative writing minor or concentration will allow you to explore the connections between creative writing, digital media, criticism, and scholarship. Our creative writing program offers literature courses, small writing workshops, and practical industry training seminars to prepare you for advanced study or careers in writing, media, and publishing. You’ll benefit from the resources provided by an accomplished faculty and the opportunities afforded by New York City itself, a worldwide center for literary publishing and the arts.

The study of creative writing offers both a practice and a foundational way of thinking that fosters empathy, resilience, and joyful innovation. You will study a diversity of forms, genres, and voices, and discover the ways in which language is a primary tool to realize not only a creative career but also a creative life.

Of course, you’ll learn more than creative writing here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, history, mathematics, languages, and the arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education. We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.

The creative writing minor for English majors allows students to take four creative writing classes. This increases the total number of required courses for the English major from 10 to 14. A typical course of study for this option is:

- Two theory courses
- Three pre-1800 courses
- Four English creative writing courses (at 3000 level or above).
- Six literature electives (at 3000 level or above). Two of these courses may be cognate courses.

The minor in creative writing for students in majors other than English consists of:

- Four four-credit courses which must be drawn from 3000-level and above English creative writing courses.
- One of these creative writing courses may be a cross-listed course. (The exception to this rule is COMM 2211: Journalism Workshop.)
- Independent studies, approved by the director of creative writing, are also accepted.


- Two advanced courses (3000-level and above) in literature offered through the English department. Cognate courses (3000-level and above) and courses meeting literature requirements in the classics department, the literary studies program, or the modern languages department may be utilized to fulfill this requirement.

The creative writing concentration within the English major consists of 11 Courses:

- One theory course
- Five literature electives
- Four creative writing courses
- One capstone course (this would be a four-credit class)

The English department also offers an honors option for seniors with a GPA of 3.6 or higher in English who wish to do an ambitious piece of research and writing under the individual direction of faculty or in conjunction with a senior seminar (maximum length is 40 pages double-spaced). Faculty advisers can be any full-time faculty member or writer in residence.
