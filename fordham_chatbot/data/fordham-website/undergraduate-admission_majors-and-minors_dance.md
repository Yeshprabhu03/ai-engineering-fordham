Do you remember the first time a dancer moved you? When the movement of her body seemed to become the expression of her (and your) heart, mind, and soul? We develop exceptionally talented dancers, ready to perform in any genre across today’s diverse dance landscape.

We’ve partnered with The Ailey School, the official school of the world famous Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, to create a highly innovative Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in dance that nurtures the vanguard of creative expression.

We offer the best of both worlds: the artistic preeminence of The Ailey School, coupled with an exceptional liberal arts education, rooted in the Jesuit tradition of academic excellence.

To join our prestigious program, you must have superior talent and potential for a dance performance career, good technique training in ballet and modern dance, musicality, energy, creativity, and the ability to communicate through movement.

You must also have strong academic credentials, including a competitive GPA, strong writing skills, and community activities.

That’s because you’ll learn more than dance here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, history, mathematics, languages, science, and other performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education. We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.

In addition to existing need-based aid and merit scholarships, applicants will also be evaluated for audition-based artistic scholarships.
