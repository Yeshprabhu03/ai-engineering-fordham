We live in a digital world—but do we understand it?

In the 21st century, much of our communication is “mediated,” thanks to technology. In the digital technologies and emerging media program at Fordham, you’ll delve into the digital world to understand its cultural and ethical impact.

Our program takes an interdisciplinary approach to the study of digital communication. You’ll gain media literacy through critical, analytical, and practical knowledge. And you’ll learn the essential tools of digital technologies and emerging media.

Our faculty members are a dynamic mix of media scholars and industry leaders who serve as models of critical dialogue. We emphasize values and ethics in various settings, including public interest, government, NGO, and corporate cultures.

But you’ll learn more than digital technology and emerging media here at Fordham. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, history, mathematics, languages, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.
