Understand economic theory in the context of history, politics, and philosophy.

How do businesses, governments, and people make sound—or risky—economic decisions? What are the factors, motivations, and contexts underlying those choices? In the economics major at Fordham, we explore economic theory—and a lot more—to find answers to these questions.

Our program consists of an analytical core with area studies in international, development, monetary, financial, and public-sector economics. Because economic systems don’t occur in a vacuum, we turn to history, political science, philosophy, and mathematics to deepen our understanding. You will develop a clear and concise approach to critically assessing a wide range of issues.

Good teaching is a top priority for our economics faculty. We keep class sizes small, the coursework engaging, and the standards high.

You’ll learn more than economics here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, history, literature, languages, science, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.

-
There are three majors available:

- Economics, which combines an analytical core with studies in international, development, monetary, financial, and public-sector economics
- Mathematics/Economics, which merges modern economic analysis with key mathematical disciplines
- International Political Economy, which explores our increasingly interdependent and politicized global economy. You must have a high GPA to pursue this major.
