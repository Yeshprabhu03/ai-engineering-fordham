# Engineering Physics

Degree Options: Major, Minor

Locations: Rose Hill

Visit the [Physics and Engineering Physics Department](/academics/departments/physics-and-engineering-physics/)

Understand the principles of matter and motion—and then build things.

You’ll study a broad range of fundamental engineering and physics principles in classes, the teaching lab, research projects, and internships. You can take the classical path to a degree in engineering physics—four years at Fordham—or pursue a five-year double degree in physics and engineering, including two years at Columbia or Case Western.

You’ll graduate ready to take the next step towards a career in architecture, business, engineering, finance, law, medicine, secondary education, and other fields.

You’ll learn more than engineering physics here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, history, literature, languages, science, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.

-
The engineering physics major is available at Fordham College at Rose Hill.

The engineering physics has three concentrations:

- Mechanical
- Biomedical
- Electrical

We also have a 3-2 Cooperative Program In Engineering that leads to a double degree in physics and engineering:

- 5-year program
- 3 years of study in physics or chemistry at Fordham
- 2 years of study in engineering at Columbia University or Case Western Reserve University

Facilities and Research Opportunities

In the Engineering Physics Teaching Laboratory, you use high-tech equipment to explore the physics of materials and simulate real world automated assembly processes. Equipment includes:

- Material testing setups
- Fluid dynamics experimental workstation
- Programmable assembly line
- LabView, MATLAB, Mathematica software

Youll use our computational resources for modeling and simulation of mechanical, electrical, and environmental engineering and physics phenomena and processes.

We have active research programs in nuclear?and particle physics (theory) and in theoretical condensed matter (mesoscopic and nanoscale) physics. Our experimental research focuses on:

- Materials science
- Polymer physics
- Low-temperature physics
- Liquid crystals
- Medical physics
- Laser optics

Other smart, creative, research projects:

- Biomedical engineering
- Building a chess-playing robot
- Spectroscopic detection of melanoma
- Radar and visual data fusion for tracking bullets in flight

Want to connect, network, learn and compete?

We have an active physics club that arranges annual tours to area research labs.


Our tutoring center can help you with introductory physics courses.

And don't forget your mitt. We go head-to-head with the chemistry department in an annual softball game.### Study Abroad

Take your coursework global with a study abroad program. Fordham has connections with more than 150 programs in universities all over the world, including Germany, China, Turkey, Argentina, and the Gabelli London satellite campus.
