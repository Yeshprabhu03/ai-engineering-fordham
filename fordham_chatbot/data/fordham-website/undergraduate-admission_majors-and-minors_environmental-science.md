And you’ll study in New York City, one of the most vibrant centers of environmental education and urban ecology in the world.

Of course, you’ll learn more than environmental science here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, economics, mathematics, languages, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

-
As an environmental science major, your studies include:

- foundation courses in biology, chemistry, and physics
- electives that allow you to tailor your interests toward life or chemical sciences
- environmental research and internships
- humanities, policy, and ethics courses with an environmental emphasis

In your first two years you’ll develop a solid scientific grounding. After that you’ll specialize in the area you feel most passionate about through coursework, independent research, and internships.

### Facilities

Because of environmental science’s interdisciplinary nature, you will conduct research in dedicated departmental labs:

- Biological Sciences
- Chemistry
- Physics
- Natural Sciences

At the Calder Center Biological Field Station, a 113-acre expanse of forest, lakes, and wetlands in nearby Armonk, N.Y, you can take ecology classes and conduct field research alongside a selected number of biologists who focus on water management and conservation for government and industry.

At the Center for Urban Ecology, you can study the intersection of nature and the city with scientists researching the impact of urbanization on regional ecosystems and the role people play in physiological, ecological, and evolutionary processes.

### Fieldwork

Academic Internships are available at world-renowned institutions:

- Bronx River Alliance (New York Department of Parks)
- Wildlife Conservation Society (Bronx Zoo)
