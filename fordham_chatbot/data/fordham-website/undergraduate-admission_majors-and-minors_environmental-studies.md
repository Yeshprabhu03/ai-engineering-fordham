The goal: to explore the causes, effects, and policy solutions to environmental problems that we all face—and we all must address. Our mission reflects Fordham’s: to respect the environment and serve the greater good. We stress environmental literacy, stewardship, sustainable development, and environmental justice.

You’ll learn the complex scientific, economic, political, and ethical interactions and processes that create our home on Earth. You’ll study in New York City, one of the most vibrant centers of environmental education and urban ecology in the world. Fieldwork can take you around the globe.

You’ll learn more than environmental studies here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, history, mathematics, languages, literature, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education. We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.
