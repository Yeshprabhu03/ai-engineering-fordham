It’s a highly individualized, interdisciplinary course of study based in the Department of Languages and Cultures. With the help of a faculty advisor, you’ll craft a rigorous course of study that fits your passions and ambitions. Most of your classes will be in German. You’ll build a work portfolio. You’ll become fluent in German. And in the spring semester of your senior year, you’ll make a final presentation demonstrating your mastery.

We draw on a long Jesuit tradition of scholarship on and respect for the world's diverse languages and cultures—and virtually all of them are in New York City. From cultural events to people on the streets, New York City is your classroom for learning German.

You’ll learn more than German studies here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, economics, mathematics, ethics, science, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.

As a German area studies major, you take 10 required courses and electives. It’s an individualized, interdisciplinary major, so tailor a track to fit your interests.
