Picture yourself as CIO or head of business technology? We can see it too.

Majoring in information systems is for students who want to launch careers using technology to solve business problems.

Today, nearly every business is a technology business. Tech drives innovation. Tech underpins progress. Tech is on the mind of every consumer.

The Gabelli School's information systems major will teach you how to harness information, master business data, and be forward-thinking about the power of technological systems.

IS majors choose among three career-focused tracks: business analytics, digital business innovation, and enterprise architecture. These allow you to customize your study of technology management to the path you envision for yourself.

Of course, you’ll learn more than information systems here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, economics, mathematics, languages, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.
