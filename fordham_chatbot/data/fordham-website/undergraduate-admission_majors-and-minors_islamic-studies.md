# Islamic Studies

Degree Options: Minor

Locations: Lincoln Center, Rose Hill[Visit the Islamic studies page in the academic bulletin](https://bulletin.fordham.edu/undergraduate/islamic-studies/?_ga=2.117505930.2057140245.1698372226-248710660.1694859892)

Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world. Learn about its history, philosophy, and cultural heritage.

Despite being the world’s second largest religion after Christianity, Islam remains one of the least understood religious faiths and civilizations among American students.

You’ll explore the multifaceted aspects of Islam through a wide variety of expressions, such as literature, religious doctrine, philosophy, social norms and practices, and politics, as well as various research methods. You’ll also learn how Islam has become an important faith in regions beyond the Middle East—from China and South America to Mexico and the United States.

In addition to studying in the classroom, several courses that count toward the Islamic studies minor are community engaged learning courses that allow students to work with and learn from partner organizations, giving you the opportunity to see the way Muslim faith and culture is practiced across New York City.

The Islamic studies minor furthers Fordham’s mission by challenging students to view the world through non-Western constructs. You’ll gain exposure to a wide array of ideas drawn from various Islamic discourses. At a time when misunderstandings about the Muslim faith abound, Islamic studies can help you grapple with the complexities and challenges of our world.
