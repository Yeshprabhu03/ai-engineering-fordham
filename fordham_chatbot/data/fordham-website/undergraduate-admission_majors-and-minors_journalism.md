In the journalism program at Fordham, you’ll learn what it means to be a successful and ethically minded journalist in a rapidly evolving field. We teach students not only to report quickly and accurately, but also with compassion.

Our program takes a multimedia approach to the study of journalism. You’ll start by building basic skills such as interviewing, writing, shooting, recording, and editing. Then you’ll move into more advanced, specialized classes. Each journalism major is also required to spend a semester working on a campus media outlet, to gain the skills—and portfolio—to land internships at local news organizations. We also require a course in social media, created specifically for journalists.

Our faculty members are a dynamic mix of media scholars and professional, award-winning journalists who serve as models of critical dialogue. We emphasize values and ethics in various settings, including public interest, government, NGO, and corporate cultures.

But you’ll learn more than journalism here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, history, mathematics, languages, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.
