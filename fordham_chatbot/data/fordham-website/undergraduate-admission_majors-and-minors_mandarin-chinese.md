A rapidly growing language at the heart of international relations and business.

The past three decades have witnessed the unprecedented development of China as the second largest economy in the world and a leading force in global politics, economy, and culture. As a Mandarin Chinese minor, you’ll study a language that has become increasingly relevant and popular among students looking to learn one of key modes of communication in our global society.

Economic and cultural ties between the United States and China have also increased exponentially. Fordham has been a participant in these exchanges through its International Political Economy and Development (IPED) program and through partnerships at the Gabelli School of Business. Choosing a minor in Mandarin Chinese is a great way to complement your major studies in international studies, math and economics, political science, and other fields.

In addition, you’ll learn more than Mandarin Chinese here when you study philosophy, theology, history, mathematics, languages, and the arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education. We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.
