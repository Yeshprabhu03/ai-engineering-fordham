You'll study the full sweep of artistic, literary, scholastic, and cultural issues that make medieval civilization such a rich field of study, drawing on the expertise of faculty in a range of fields. You'll read Cervantes, Dante, Augustine, and Aquinas. You'll learn about martyrs and madmen, nuns and Vikings, Byzantine art and Islam's impact on Spain.

And you'll graduate ready for a career or advanced study in the field.

New York City offers enormous resources for the budding medievalist, including rich collections at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York Public Library, Morgan Library, and the world-famous Cloisters, assembled right above the Hudson River with architectural elements from different medieval buildings.

But you'll learn more than medieval studies here. You'll also study philosophy, theology, literature, languages, ethics, mathematics, science, and the performing arts through Fordham's common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

We want you to excel in your field-and as a human being.
