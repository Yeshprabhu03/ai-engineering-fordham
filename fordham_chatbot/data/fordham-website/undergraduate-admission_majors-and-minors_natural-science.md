You’ll study biology, chemistry, and physics, immunology, physiology, and genetics, among other subjects. You’ll join our faculty in research projects on campus and at renowned institutions. You’ll also design and present your own research.

We integrate the theory and practice of science to provide a framework for exploring questions of ethics. As part of a Jesuit university, we strongly believe in the importance of using education to help others—and to develop the self.

That’s why you’ll learn more than natural sciences here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, history, literature, languages, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.

Our rigorous program is designed to prepare you for graduate school. Natural science majors take 20 required classes and six electives, including four labs. We cap our core classes at 25 students, and our upper-level elective labs at 16 students.

Our department contributes to majors in:

- environmental science
- bioinformatics
- neuroscience
- psychology (through specialized introductory lab courses)

We also prepare non-science majors for medical, dental, veterinary, and pre-health professions.

### Facilities and Research Opportunities

We are avid researchers. Join faculty research projects in collaboration with faculty mentors affiliated with major research institutions, including:

- Rockefeller University
- Columbia College of Physicians & Surgeons
- Brookhaven National Laboratory
- Cornell University

Recent faculty research projects include:

- heat shock proteins (Hsp’s) and other biochemical responses to physiological stress in horseshoe crabs
- using medicinal chemistry to improve the biological activity of natural products for the treatment of viral infections and cancer
- mammalian aging, Progeroid cells, and human chromosomal disorders

Recent student research projects include:

- study of ultraviolet light on lens proteins
- effects of nitric oxide on cells of the human immune system
- mechanisms of heavy metal toxicity in invertebrates

### Want to connect, network, learn, and compete?

Our student-researchers have shared their results at major scientific meetings, and some have been published in leading professional journals.

Present your research paper at the Eastern Colleges Science Conference, which since 1947 has brought together undergraduates from 50 colleges to share their scientific findings.

Become one of the many students who represent the Natural Sciences Department at the annual Undergraduate Research Symposium.

Apply for summer research grants and awards

### Scholarship Opportunities

Fordham and the Wildlife Conservation Society at the Bronx Zoo coordinate NSF-funded scholarships to science students who complete a teacher credential program and commit to teaching science in high-need school districts after graduation.

### Study Abroad

Take your coursework global with a study abroad program. Fordham has connections with more than 150 programs in universities all over the world, including Germany, China, Turkey, Argentina, and the Gabelli London satellite campus.
