Learn to defuse conflict and work for a more just and humane world.

Serving others, striving for justice—these are bedrock values of a Fordham education. By minoring in peace and justice studies, you’ll pursue your own interests and passions as you learn how these values can be realized in the world.

Founded in 1986, the peace and justice studies program embodies the Jesuit, Catholic ideals of Fordham, encompassing a wide scope of issues. In the classroom, you’ll study conflict resolution as well as environmental justice, race and culture, war and terrorism, criminal justice reform, economic justice, or other topics of your choice. Some of your instructors will be teaching from personal experience.

And you’ll also gain your own experience through internships or service projects in New York City, around the country, or abroad. You could be immersed in a local community in Asia or Central America, learning about the legacy of apartheid in South Africa, or interning with an advocacy group in New York, home of the U.N.’s headquarters—just a subway ride away—and many nongovernmental organizations. Two such learning experiences are required for the minor. After completing the program, you’ll graduate with a deeper understanding of global issues as well as the process of effecting change.

Of course, you’ll learn about more than peace and justice studies here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, economics, mathematics, languages, science, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.
