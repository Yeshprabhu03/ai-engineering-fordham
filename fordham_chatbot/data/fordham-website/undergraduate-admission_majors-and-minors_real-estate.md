Real estate is an ever-expanding, multifaceted global industry. Learn about it in New York City, a center of international commerce and investment.

You’ll learn how the real estate industry functions and how real estate assets—the built environment in which we all live—are analyzed, financed, and developed.

The minor consists of six courses covering real estate law, economics, and finance, as well as statistics and macroeconomics—all of which complement many majors, including those in economics, communication and media studies, and political science. Fordham’s location gives students a distinct advantage: the opportunity to study in the real estate capital of the world, with a focus on cutting-edge academics and professional practices.

The real estate minor will help you hone your critical thinking and decision-making skills to advance in the global real estate industry. And they’ll do it all in small classes taught by world-class faculty.
