Working for human rights and social justice are core components of a Jesuit education—and of social work. When you study with our nationally recognized social work department at Fordham, you’ll see the best aspects of humanity—compassion, empathy, commitment, intelligence—focused on helping people who might be experiencing life at its worst.

Our challenging and stimulating program trains you to improve the well being of individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities in an agency setting. It’s a two-year program that will have you in the field as much as you’re in the classroom. You’ll study with our nationally recognized faculty and participate in their research, learn evidence-based social work practice, and gain the cultural competence skills you need to work with diverse populations. You’ll embed in local communities for fieldwork. Through it all, you’ll help people.

You’ll learn more than social work here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, history, mathematics, languages, science, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.

-
As a social work major, you will:

- study the breadth and depth of social work
- gain in-depth field experience
- participate in individual and group mentoring sessions

Social work is a two-year program. You will take eight required classes. You’ll do fieldwork at a social service agency in the second year. The fieldwork will consist of approximately 16 hours of field education, usually scheduled two-three days per week, for a total of 420 hours in the agency and 30 hours in the accompanying integrative seminar.
