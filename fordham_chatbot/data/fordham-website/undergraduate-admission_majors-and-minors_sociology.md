To be human is to be with humans. Sociology explores the dynamics of group life.

Aristotle called us “social animals.” And he was right. We humans are defined by our connections to (and reliance on) each other. As a sociology major at Fordham, you’ll study group life—the complex social and cultural world that shapes human experience, from the dynamic of two strangers passing on a city street to current trends in globalization.

Sociology combines scientific and humanistic approaches to study the diversity of social relationships in our modern world. You’ll study urban and rural life; family patterns and relationships; social change and movements; inter-group relations; social class, environment, culture, and communications; and community responses to disasters—both natural and created. Through the careful analysis and evaluation of social phenomena, you’ll develop excellent critical thinking and research skills that will prepare you for graduate school or the professional world.

We believe sociology can improve the quality of people’s lives by promoting awareness of the inequalities—race, class, gender, religion, citizenship, sexuality—so common across the globe. Sociological knowledge can make a difference in homes, communities, and countries.

You’ll learn more than sociology here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, history, mathematics, languages, science, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.
