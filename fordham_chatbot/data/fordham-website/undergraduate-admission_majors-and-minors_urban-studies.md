Learn how cities tick in one of the most influential urban centers on the planet.

For the first time in human history, more people live in cities than on farms. How do cities differ from Anchorage to Santiago, Reykjavik to Tokyo, Casablanca to Capetown? What happens when so many people cluster so close together? How do people think, work, and live? Who excels, and who falls behind?

Designed as an interdisciplinary program, our program offers a broad introduction to the city and the urban environment. You’ll combine coursework and research in a variety of disciplines with hands-on experience in New York City as well as other American and international cities.

You’ll graduate ready to pursue a wide range of careers in government service, community development, nonprofit, journalism, teaching, social work, public policy, architecture, urban planning, law, and more.

You’ll learn more than urban studies here. You’ll also study philosophy, theology, history, mathematics, languages, science, and the performing arts through Fordham’s common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.

We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being.
