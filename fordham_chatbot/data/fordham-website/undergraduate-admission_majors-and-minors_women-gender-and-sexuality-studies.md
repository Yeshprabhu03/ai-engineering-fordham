Take an interdisciplinary approach to a profound social justice goal: understanding how gender and sexuality shape our culture, daily lives, social institutions, and interactions.

More and more, society is recognizing that gender and sexuality affect how we navigate the world around us, that these pervasive forces can reshape old axes of power and cultivate new ones. Times are changing. If you want to be a part of that change, consider the Women’s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies program at Fordham.

Originally founded as the Women’s Studies program, the Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies program takes an expansive view of gender and sexuality studies as both a lens on and a vehicle of social change. Our dynamic interdisciplinary curriculum covers the breadth of the human experience with gender and sexuality. Our courses explore the diversity of women’s experiences, investigate women’s contributions historically and across cultures, and delve into concurrent emphases on gender and sexuality as primary categories of analysis. By looking at gender today—especially where it intersects with sexuality, class, and race—you’ll become an expert in these intersectionalities that modern-day scholars have embraced. You’ll also learn how to use that information to create positive change. And since this is an integrative program, you’ll take classes in the humanities, arts, and social and natural sciences that focus on these themes.

By studying a broad range of topics and taking literal, empirical, and theoretical approaches to your major coursework, you will become adept at traversing a world molded by gender and sexuality, and be encouraged to become an agent of social change who works for the public good.

We want you to excel in your field—and as a human being. That’s why your course of study will be complemented by Fordham’s core curriculum. It’s the centerpiece of our liberal arts education and the foundation upon which every one of our majors is built. In addition to courses on women, gender, and sexuality, you’ll also study philosophy, theology, history, mathematics, languages, science, and the performing arts.
