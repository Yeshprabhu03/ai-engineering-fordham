# Undergraduate Outcomes

At Fordham, students receive a rigorous education in one of the world’s greatest cities—an education that will sharpen your talents, widen your vision, and prepare you to embrace and create change.

And being in New York City means you won't have to wait until the summer to intern. Fordham students have internships year-round, easily navigating between our campuses and the [top industries](/undergraduate-admission/why-fordham/outcomes/leading-industries-statistics/) that make NYC their home. In fact, nearly 90% of Fordham students have at least one internship before they graduate (and many have two, three, four, and five!).

It’s an undergraduate education that works—our graduates go out into the world to pursue meaningful careers and build lives that reflect Fordham’s spirit of passionate engagement.

## First Destinations

Each year, the Office of Career Services reaches out to every member of the previous year's graduating class to find out where they landed and to offer their assistance if needed. For the Class of 2024, they were able to confirm the "first destination" of 87% of the graduates (an exceptionally high knowledge rate).

## More Points of Pride

## Supporting Success Through Access

Fordham graduates not only have a network of over 175,000 alumni worldwide to call upon, they have the life-long support of the [Career Center](/resources/career-resources/career-center/). Their diligent work and extensive connections ensure access to top employers and institutions so that students pursue meaningful work after graduation, whether that be starting a career, pursuing further education, or devoting time to public service.
