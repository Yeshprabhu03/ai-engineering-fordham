**Anyone can be Jesuit educated:**We welcome people of all faiths, people exploring their faith, and people who come to their values from outside of religious faith.

"Love should show itself more in actions than in words."

- St. Ignatius of Loyola, Founder of the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits)**What does Jesuit education mean at Fordham?** Here are some ways Fordham helps students become compassionate and ethical people dedicated to helping others.

**Ask every question**

Our [rigorous liberal arts curriculum](/undergraduate-admission/majors-and-minors/)—both in our undergraduate business and liberal arts colleges—**teaches you how to think, not what to think.**

Beginning in your first year, faculty will ask you to question assumptions and wrestle with ethical gray areas in courses such as Faith & Critical Reason and Philosophy of Human Nature. You’ll develop indispensable critical thinking and public speaking skills by engaging with the course material as well as communities across the city.

You’ll be able to engage in research with faculty, [study abroad](/study-abroad/), and [pursue internships](/academics/undergraduate-education/fordham-internship-promise/). In small classes with big-hearted mentors who truly care, you’ll get the attention you need to thrive at Fordham.

**Making an impact**

At Fordham, we encourage you to go out in the world and apply your knowledge to help others.

Through [Serving the City internships](/academics/undergraduate-education/serving-the-city-internships/), [community engaged learning courses](/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/external-affairs/center-for-community-engaged-learning/), and programs like [Urban Plunge](/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/external-affairs/center-for-community-engaged-learning/student-programming/urban-plunge/) and [Global Outreach](/about/living-the-mission/campus-ministry/justice-and-service/global-outreach/), students apply what they learn in class to the real world.

**This is more than community service**—it’s an opportunity to learn with and from our fellow New Yorkers and experts in various fields working to solve problems facing our communities.

**Create community**

Since the 16th century, Jesuit educators have sought to empower **empathetic leaders dedicated to building a better world**. At Fordham, you’ll learn with educators and peers from all 50 U.S. states and more than 100 countries, each coming from a variety of faith traditions and backgrounds so you can understand issues from **multiple perspectives**.

Our **small and interactive classes**, with a 14:1 student-to-faculty ratio, will help you gain the **confidence** to question assumptions, seek answers to the complex problems of our world, and develop the skills to become **global citizens**.

When you put all of these pieces together—knowledge and intellect, empathy and ethics, and social action—you can see why [employers seek out Fordham grads](/undergraduate-admission/why-fordham/outcomes/). They’re **hardworking, engaged team players who know how to advocate for positive change.**
