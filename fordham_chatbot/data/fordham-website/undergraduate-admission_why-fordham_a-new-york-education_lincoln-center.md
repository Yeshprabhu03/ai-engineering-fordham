New York State of Mind

It’s in the center of New York City, surrounded by exactly what you have in mind: Skyscrapers. Big business. City lights. We're a subway ride to Wall Street, a stone’s throw from media giants, across town from the United Nations, steps to Central Park, and blocks from Broadway.

At Fordham's Lincoln Center campus, you’ll live and learn in a global capital of culture, finance, technology, fashion, and so much more. Professionals at the top of their fields come to classes as visiting faculty and guest speakers. And more than 80% of our students complete an internship.

And yet the Jesuit education you’ll earn here never loses sight of the humanity we strive to serve, and you’ll gain a connection to this place and its people. Our students see college as a chance to engage with the world—its people, its cultures, its urgent problems, and its enduring questions.

### At Home in the Heart of the City

In many ways, despite being in the center of Manhattan, this campus offers a more intimate experience. There are about 3,000 undergraduates studying at Lincoln Center, with about half of those students living right on campus.

The eight-acre campus spans two city blocks. At its center is a sunny, welcoming plaza where you can find a respite from the city.
