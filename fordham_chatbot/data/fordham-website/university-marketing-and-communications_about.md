# About University Marketing and Communications

## UMC Services

We are responsible for protecting and growing Fordham's brand. Check out our brand guidelines. They guide our decisions, influence our direction and inspire our work.

In addition to leading institutional branding and marketing initiatives, we have an array of services available to help you with your advertising and marketing projects.

We provide timely news and information to the University community and the public, including students, trustees, faculty, alumni, parents, and staff.

Social media can be an effective way to brand Fordham to multiple audiences. What you publish, and every engagement strategy should be executed with the Fordham brand in mind.

A team of web communications professionals in Fordham's Office of Marketing and Communications supports the Fordham website.
