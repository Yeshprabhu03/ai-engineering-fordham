# Event Promotion

Below are various channels available within the university to help you get the word out about your events and programs. Though you may not need to utilize each of these channels for every event or program, you may find this checklist helpful in planning your marketing strategy.

## University Events Calendar

The [University events calendar](https://news.fordham.edu/events/) allows you to showcase your events on fordham.edu and news.fordham.edu. Submitting your event to the calendar should ideally be your first step in promoting your event. To submit your event to the calendar, please go to: [fordham.edu/submitevent](https://news.fordham.edu/events/community/add)

## Website

[Create a webpage](/university-marketing-and-communications/website-management/) about your event on your website to serve as a destination for any calendar listings and to provide a landing page for search engine results. Page should include title, date, location, description, detailed schedule if applicable, RSVP/registration information, and speaker bio if possible. Promote your event webpage on your home page and other areas of your website.
