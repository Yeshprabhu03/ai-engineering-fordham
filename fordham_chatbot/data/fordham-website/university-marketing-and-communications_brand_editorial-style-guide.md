# Editorial Style Guide

Fordham University follows the [Associated Press Stylebook (AP Style)](http://www.apstylebook.com/) and uses [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](http://www.merriam-webster.com/) for its print and online communications. In some cases, we have our own preferred editorial style. This guide includes a number of Fordham-specific variations on AP Style. It also includes information about basic grammar and punctuation, frequently misspelled and misused words, Fordham-specific terms, and preferred usage.

It’s designed to promote the use of a consistent editorial style and to provide clear answers to common questions faced by anyone writing or editing copy for Fordham publications.

This guide is updated regularly. If you have a question about editorial style or usage that is not addressed here, please write to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#aec3cfdcc5cbdac7c0c9eec8c1dccac6cfc380cbcadb).
