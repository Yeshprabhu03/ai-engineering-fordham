# Recent Brand Updates

Fordham's brand is designed to be dynamic and enduring. We constantly evolve our guidelines to meet the shifting needs of our audiences, the marketplace, and technology. The most recent updates to our brand standards are listed below.

## Google Slides Templates

## Alumni Designations

[December 2025] Instead of using abbreviations to identify the college or school Fordham alumni attended (FCRH, FCLC, GSAS, etc.), we will identify alumni by their class year(s) and, if appropriate, the graduate degree(s) they earned. We will no longer use the school codes when referring to alumni. [Learn more](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KC08cxmMpcHnja1jQrGAZDk8feoJU8eUzqI0Hh2Qpts/edit?tab=t.0).

## Punctuation of Academic Degrees

[December 2025] We recommend forgoing periods in academic degree abbreviations to keep this style of identifying alumni from becoming more cumbersome than it needs to be. [Learn more](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pT65Hk5KHNGgiEfATZ43DeB39Yq4VvY7JsgEgIt1uIQ/edit?usp=sharing).

## New editorial guidelines for UX/UI elements on the website

[November 2025] To facilitate ease of reading and consistency across the Fordham website, we are standardizing capitalization and punctuation of UX/UI elements across the website. [Check out our Website Capitalization and Punctuation Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JQ3JYVVrfafHBQGlo2QXFZIR08J4JKO0ujAcG-aaEoQ/edit?tab=t.0).

## Update to headings font on the website

[October 2025] We recently updated the H1, H2, H3, etc. from Owner’s Wide to Modern Gothic to improve readability. Owners Wide can still be used in hero treatments and subheadings.
