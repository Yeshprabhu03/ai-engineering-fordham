## Things to Know

Fordham social media administrators should register their official departmental accounts with University Marketing and Communications to facilitate collaboration between accounts. Registered accounts will be added to the University’s [social media directory](/about/social-media/#d.en.46504).

Each official social media account must have at least two administrators with fordham.edu email addresses: a primary and a secondary. While students may assist in managing accounts, they should not hold the highest administrative rights. This ensures continuity and security in account management and avoids abandoned accounts.
