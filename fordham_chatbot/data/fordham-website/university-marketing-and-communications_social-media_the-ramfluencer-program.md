**Fordham Rams:** Create Social Media Video Content

Is creating TikToks and Reels your thing? Is one of your dreams to go viral? Then keep reading!

The Office of University Marketing and Communications is looking for students to film short videos of their Fordham experience. Bring us on a local outing, show us your daily routine, give us a look at what your favorite activities are like from the inside—and feel free to invite your friends. Get creative and have fun!

Below, you will find two options.




## Become a Ramfluencer

If becoming a social media influencer is what you are looking for, we encourage you to apply to become a Fordham Ramfluencer! Help us capture Fordham life outside the classroom, and more.

*The Ramfluencer application has closed for the fall semester. It will reopen in the spring.*

## Submit Videos At Your Convenience

If you have a video you wish to submit for consideration for our social media platforms, please fill out the “Submit Content” form. We are eager to showcase our students’ lives through their own eyes, so just go ahead and submit any video for consideration.* If approved, we will reach out to you with where and when we would publish your video through our From the Ram Cam program. If denied, we will do our best to reply with an explanation.

*Submitting content through our “Submit Content” form has no monetary compensation.
