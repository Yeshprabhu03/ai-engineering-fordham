# Fordham Website Basics

We launched the new Fordham website with a phased migration in 2021. It is maintained using Terminalfour, a web content management system.

## Need Edits to Your Page or New Content Added?

We encourage you to receive [Web Content Management Training](/university-marketing-and-communications/website-management/web-content-management-training/) so that you can control your own pages on the Fordham website. The two-part training is mandatory in order to receive access to Terminalfour and includes not only hands-on training in the software, but best practices as well.

If you are unable to receive training, need urgent changes, or are understaffed/underresourced, the website support team is available to assist. Please forward your edits or new content to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#14637176677d6071727171707675777f54727b66707c75793a717061) and one of us will be in touch with you within 24 hours Monday - Friday. We try to make all changes in a timely manner.

## Web Accessibility

[Web accessibility](/university-marketing-and-communications/website-management/web-accessibility/) ensures that everyone, including people with disabilities, can use, navigate, and contribute to our website. This is especially important as interacting with the web has become integral to life at Fordham.

## Quality Assurance and Analytics

Interested in learning how your site is performing? We can set you up with access to SiteImprove, Fordham's quality assurance and analytics tool, which checks for bad links, misspellings, and provides traffic and performance numbers on your individual sites. Complete the [SiteImprove Registration form](https://fordham.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_a4whxHzqQoRaEKN) to gain access, or contact us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#81f6e4e3f2e8f5e4e7e4e4e5e3e0e2eac1e7eef3e5e9e0ecafe4e5f4) for more information.
