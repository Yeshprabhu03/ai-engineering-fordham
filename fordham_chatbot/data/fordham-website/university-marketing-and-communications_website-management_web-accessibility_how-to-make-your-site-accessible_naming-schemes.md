# Accessible Naming Schemes

## Descriptive Page Names

The title of a page is the first thing screen readers identify and read aloud on a page. Titles should be clear, descriptive, and use plain text. Page titles also hold the most weight with search engine optimization (SEO), it helps users find your pages via search engines.

We need:

- "About" to say "About the History Department"
- "Contact Us" to say "Contact the Center for Ethics Education"

## File Names and Downloads

File names and downloads are just as important as page titles. File names should be descriptive because it helps visitors understand the document content.

What you name the file on your desktop before it is uploaded into Jadu becomes part of the link name. Screen readers scan through web pages and read aloud file names link by link.
