# Accessible PDFs

Note: Create actual web pages instead of PDFs.

If PDFs are not designed following [web accessibility](/university-marketing-and-communications/website-management/web-accessibility/) guidelines, there may be many issues that have to be resolved in order to make it ADA compliant.

It is **mandatory** that **PDFs are fully accessible/ADA compliant before** it can be uploaded to the website.

To ensure that your PDF meets accessibility requirements, there are various tools that can be used to assist with making PDFs accessible/ resolve accessibility issues.

The **maximum allowed PDF file size is 5 MB**. Please ensure all images are compressed and the total file size is under 5 MB before uploading.

## Tools for Making Accessible PDFs

### Adobe Acrobat Pro

Adobe Acrobat Pro is available for use on Fordham's virtual desktop ([mydesktop.fordham.edu](http://mydesktop.fordham.edu)) under the Academic GPU desktop option. We have also created handouts and checklists on how to make your content more accessible.

### Blackboard Ally

Blackboard Ally will automatically run all course materials through an accessibility checklist that checks for common accessibility issues. Using advanced Machine Learning algorithms, Ally will also generate a range of more accessible alternatives for the instructor’s original file and will make these available to all students in the course. Faculty Technology Services provides support for Blackboard Ally.

All faculty have a sandbox courses that they can use to test Ally out. Any administrator who'd like a sandbox course in order to use Ally can request one from [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#73111f121018111c12011733151c01171b121e5d161706).

### SensusAccess

SensusAccess is a document conversion tool, not necessarily an accessibility tool. It allows you to convert your document into various formats, which can be very helpful accessibility-wise when one format is more helpful to some with particular needs or preferences. That said, the original document must be legible or problematic elements will only be carried through the conversion process.

- Go to
[http://sensusaccess.com/convert-a-file](http://sensusaccess.com/convert-a-file) - Select "File" as the source
- Upload your document
- Select "Accessibility Conversion" as the output
- Select "pdf - Tagged PDF" (if source is not a PDF) or "pdf - Tagged PDF (text over images)" (if source is a PDF)
- Provide your email address and submit
- You will later receive an email with a
**partially accessible**version of your file as a PDF, you will still need to resolve the remaining accessible issues; the time it takes to receive the email may vary depending on the volume the site receives

### Microsoft Office

If you are creating a document using MS Office (Word, PowerPoint, and Excel), you can use the built-in accessibility checker to resolve some of the most common issues before exporting as a PDF.
