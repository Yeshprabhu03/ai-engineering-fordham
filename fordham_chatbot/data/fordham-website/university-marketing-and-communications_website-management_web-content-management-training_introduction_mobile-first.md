# Mobile First

## Think Mobile First!

Mobile traffic is overtaking desktop traffic.

- Consider how your content is going to look on your phone
- Write for mobile
- Review your web pages on a mobile device
- Do not refer to navigation on left
- Note that all left-hand supplements will appear at the bottom of the page when viewed on mobile

The Fordham University website uses responsive design; it responds to any device that it is called upon (desktop, laptop, tablet, mobile, etc).
