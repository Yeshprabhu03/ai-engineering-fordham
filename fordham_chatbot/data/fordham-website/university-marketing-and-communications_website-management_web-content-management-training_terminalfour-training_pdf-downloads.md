# PDF Downloads

You should create web pages or forms in lieu of creating PDFs. Both are much easier to update and maintain instead of PDFs.

PDFs are a major ** web accessibility** issue. If your content must be in PDF format, it

**must**be fully accessible. All schools, centers, and departments are responsible for making all web content ADA compliant. To ensure that your PDF meets accessibility requirements, you will need to use

**to check.**

**PDFs in Terminalfour**

- PDFs
**must be 100% ADA compliant**in order to be added to the website - PDFs should be uploaded to the PDF folder in the "PDF Library"
- All PDFs will go through a workflow for the Web Team to review/approve
- PDFs that are not ADA compliant will be sent back to the submitter

**Note:** Fordham University is responsible for all PDFs and Documents that live on our website, that we link to (blogs and social media), and external sites.

## Link to a PDF

The Web Team will provide the Editor with the link to the ADA compliant PDF once it has been reviewed so it can be linked on pages.
