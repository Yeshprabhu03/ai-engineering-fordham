## Styling

For the Fordham website, we have a CSS Stylesheet in place that defines how each tag will be displayed. **Do not** use the <font> tag or another styling because it overrides the CSS Stylesheet. This will create issues with [ADA compliance](/university-marketing-and-communications/website-management/web-accessibility/).

Formatting

A list of all available formats is available under Format > Formats, and this includes Headings and Buttons.

For **Headings**, the first heading you **must** use on a page is Heading 2 <h2> for accessibility best practices. Heading 1 <h1> should never be used because it is meant for the title of your page. Headings **must** go in chronological order in either direction but you should never skip a tag.

- Heading 2 should denote a section
- Heading 3 should denote a subsection, and so on.
- You should never start your page with a heading level past Heading 2.
- <h2> <h3> <h4>
- <h2> <h2> <h3> <h4>
- <h2> <h2> <h3> <h3> <h4> <h3>


To create a button, go to Format > Formats and select one of the following buttons depending on the desired style:

- btn-primary
- btn-secondary
- btn-left-add-icon-primary
- btn-left-add-icon-secondary
- btn-right-arrow-icon-primary
- btn-right-arrow-icon-secondary

After you have added a button, you can type in your button text, and you can [hyperlink the button](https://www.fordham.edu/university-marketing-and-communications/website-management/web-content-management-training/terminalfour-training/terminalfour-tutorials/insert-links/#buttons).
