# Insert Newsfeeds in TerminalFour

**Retrieve the RSS Link**

- To retrieve the RSS link from your blog: Go to the main page of the blog. Add “/?feed=rss” at the end of the URL. For example:
[https://news.fordham.edu](https://news.fordham.edu/)(Link to the main page of Fordham Newsroom)[https://news.fordham.edu/?feed=rss](https://news.fordham.edu/?feed=rss)(Link to the RSS feed)

- Confirm that you have the correct URL for the RSS feed by checking if the page is filled with code. If the URL alters slightly as you test the link, use the new URL. It should look similar to the second bullet point above or, for this example:
[https://news.fordham.edu/feed/](https://news.fordham.edu/feed/) - Copy the URL

**Create the Newsfeed**

- When editing a page and viewing the "Content" tab, click "Add content" in the upper right
