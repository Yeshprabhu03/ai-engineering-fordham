# Using Images

Terminalfour images are formatted using PXL, which is a program that automatically crops and resizes images for the web.

## General Content Image Requirements

Images added to the General content type are not processed with PXL, and will need to meet the following guidelines:

- 500px width minimum (1000px recommended)
- JPG / WebP format
- 500 KB file size (1 MB maximum)

The following properties can be found in most image editors to help meet the above image requirements:

- Save for Web / Export
- Image Quality (50-75%, or until file size requirements are met)
- Progressive
- Select Format (JPG, WebP)

## Content Type Aspect Ratios

![Screenshot of the aspect ratio section in Pixlr](/media/home/admin-use-only/categorised-archive/Aspect-Ratio-Example.png)

When selecting images, please ensure the image shape (e.g. square vs. rectangle) is similar to the content type you're uploading to. Otherwise, portions of the image may be cropped out undesirably.

If an image you've uploaded is cropped undesirably by PXL, check which aspect ratios are used by that content type below. To crop an image to a specific aspect ratio, your image editor will contain an area where you may define those properties.

The following lists contain each content type's respective aspect ratio, followed by the largest acceptable resolution.
