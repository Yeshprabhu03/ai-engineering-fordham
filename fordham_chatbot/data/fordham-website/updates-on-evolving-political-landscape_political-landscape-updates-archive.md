### » F-1 Visa Application Interviews

As of Tuesday, May 27, the U.S. Department of State has ordered U.S. embassies to [temporarily pause scheduling visa interviews](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/us/politics/trump-student-visas-interviews.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Kk8.o3_N.ZcGOIX7O3onB&smid=url-share) as consulates await further guidance on expanded social media screening and vetting of visa applicants. It’s unclear how long this pause will last. The University is closely monitoring this evolving situation, while working to develop mitigation plans, should the visa interview pause cause significant delay in your travel to the U.S.

Despite the current pause in scheduling visa interviews, for international students progressing through the visa application process, we recommend the following:

- If you are scheduled for a visa interview, proceed as planned with the interview unless the consulate advises you otherwise.
- Continue submitting all required documentation for your visa application as promptly as possible. This will help ensure that your application is ready for processing once scheduling interviews resumes.
- Monitor your email regularly for updates from the U.S. Department of State and Fordham regarding the visa application process. Staying informed and responding promptly to requests will help you navigate the process efficiently.

If you have questions regarding the visa application process, please call the Office for International Services (OIS) at +1 (718) 817-3145 or connect via email at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4f20263c0f29203d2b272e22612a2b3a) for assistance.

### » Revocation of Student Visas

International students and scholars should be aware that the U.S. Department of State has again begun revoking the visas as of Thursday, May 8, in Fordham’s case. The process is different from its previous actions: in this case SEVIS records will remain active, meaning you may stay in the U.S. to continue your studies or scholarly work, but if you leave the U.S., you will not be readmitted.

On Wednesday, May 28, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the Trump administration intends to revoke visas of Chinese students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or who are studying in "critical fields," which the New York Times reports most likely [“refers to research in the physical sciences.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/us/politics/china-student-visas-revoke.html?unlocked_article_code=1.K08.G8It.gGhNloSaPEQ5&smid=url-share) The University is monitoring this developing situation closely, and will continue to engage directly with those students potentially impacted.

Visa revocation notices are being sent to the email address you used to apply for the visa; **therefore it is important for you to check your email frequently, and certainly prior to leaving the U.S. for any reason.* **You can check your visa status anytime at: [https://ceac.state.gov/CEACStatTracker/Status.aspx](https://ceac.state.gov/CEACStatTracker/Status.aspx) (for Visa Application Type, select “NONIMMIGRANT VISA (NIV).”

****If an attorney or law firm filed the visa application on your behalf from the firm’s email address, we strongly encourage you to remain in contact with them to ensure you are informed of any changes in your visa status.*

Should you receive a notification from the U.S. Department of State regarding your visa status, contact the Office for International Services (OIS) immediately at **718-817-3145** or [ [email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#533c3a2013353c21373b323e7d363726).

-
Prudential visa revocation is a process through which the U.S. Department of State can cancel a visa without any formal immigration violations or criminal convictions. This is based on the Secretary of State’s discretionary authority if they determine a person’s presence could have potentially adverse foreign policy consequences.

-
While some revocations may be due to criminal records or immigration violations, we have seen reports of visas being revoked for seemingly minor infractions, such as traffic violations, sometimes occurring years ago. In some cases, the reasons for revocation remain unclear to both the students and the University.

If your SEVIS record is terminated, you are considered out of status. You should immediately

[contact OIS](https://www.fordham.edu/academics/academic-resources/international-services/about/staff-and-administration/)to understand the implications and discuss potential options, which may include departing the U.S. and seeking a new visa or exploring other legal pathways with the assistance of an immigration attorney. -

Yes, if the primary visa holder’s F-1 or J-1 visa is revoked, the dependent spouse’s and children’s (F-2 or J-2) visas may also be revoked.

-
Fordham University has not requested or initiated the revocation of any student visas. The authority to issue and revoke visas rests solely with the U.S. Department of State.

Universities like Fordham are required to maintain and update student information in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), a federal database. These updates reflect a student’s enrollment status and compliance with visa regulations. However, universities do not have the authority to request or cause a visa to be revoked. Visa revocations can only be made by the U.S. government.

-
It’s important to understand that the U.S. government has broad authority to revoke visas. While the right to peaceful protest is a fundamental freedom in the United States, immigration officials may scrutinize any activity that they perceive as a potential threat to national security or public safety. International students, faculty, and staff should consult with an immigration attorney for advice on their specific circumstances.
